in
the
year
1878
took
my
degree
of
doctor
of
medicine
of
the
university
of
london
and
proceeded
to
netley
to
go
through
the
course
prescribed
for
surgeons
in
the
army
having
completed
my
studies
there
was
duly
attached
to
the
fifth
northumberland
fusiliers
as
assistant
surgeon
the
regiment
was
stationed
in
india
at
the
time
and
before
could
join
it
the
second
afghan
war
had
broken
out
on
landing
at
bombay
learned
that
my
corps
had
advanced
through
the
passes
and
was
already
deep
in
the
enemy
country
followed
however
with
many
other
officers
who
were
in
the
same
situation
as
myself
and
succeeded
in
reaching
candahar
in
safety
where
found
my
regiment
and
at
once
entered
upon
my
new
duties
the
campaign
brought
honours
and
promotion
to
many
but
for
me
it
had
nothing
but
misfortune
and
disaster
was
removed
from
my
brigade
and
attached
to
the
berkshires
with
whom
served
at
the
fatal
battle
of
maiwand
there
was
struck
on
the
shoulder
by
jezail
bullet
which
shattered
the
bone
and
grazed
the
subclavian
artery
should
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
murderous
ghazis
had
it
not
been
for
the
devotion
and
courage
shown
by
murray
my
orderly
who
threw
me
across
pack
horse
and
succeeded
in
bringing
me
safely
to
the
british
lines
worn
with
pain
and
weak
from
the
prolonged
hardships
which
had
undergone
was
removed
with
great
train
of
wounded
sufferers
to
the
base
hospital
at
peshawur
here
rallied
and
had
already
improved
so
far
as
to
be
able
to
walk
about
the
wards
and
even
to
bask
little
upon
the
verandah
when
was
struck
down
by
enteric
fever
that
curse
of
our
indian
possessions
for
months
my
life
was
despaired
of
and
when
at
last
came
to
myself
and
became
convalescent
was
so
weak
and
emaciated
that
medical
board
determined
that
not
day
should
be
lost
in
sending
me
back
to
england
was
dispatched
accordingly
in
the
troopship
orontes
and
landed
month
later
on
portsmouth
jetty
with
my
health
irretrievably
ruined
but
with
permission
from
paternal
government
to
spend
the
next
nine
months
in
attempting
to
improve
it
had
neither
kith
nor
kin
in
england
and
was
therefore
as
free
as
air
or
as
free
as
an
income
of
eleven
shillings
and
sixpence
day
will
permit
man
to
be
under
such
circumstances
naturally
gravitated
to
london
that
great
cesspool
into
which
all
the
loungers
and
idlers
of
the
empire
are
irresistibly
drained
there
stayed
for
some
time
at
private
hotel
in
the
strand
leading
comfortless
meaningless
existence
and
spending
such
money
as
had
considerably
more
freely
than
ought
so
alarming
did
the
state
of
my
finances
become
that
soon
realized
that
must
either
leave
the
metropolis
and
rusticate
somewhere
in
the
country
or
that
must
make
complete
alteration
in
my
style
of
living
choosing
the
latter
alternative
began
by
making
up
my
mind
to
leave
the
hotel
and
to
take
up
my
quarters
in
some
less
pretentious
and
less
expensive
domicile
on
the
very
day
that
had
come
to
this
conclusion
was
standing
at
the
criterion
bar
when
someone
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
and
turning
round
recognized
young
stamford
who
had
been
dresser
under
me
at
bart
the
sight
of
friendly
face
in
the
great
wilderness
of
london
is
pleasant
thing
indeed
to
lonely
man
in
old
days
stamford
had
never
been
particular
crony
of
mine
but
now
hailed
him
with
enthusiasm
and
he
in
his
turn
appeared
to
be
delighted
to
see
me
in
the
exuberance
of
my
joy
asked
him
to
lunch
with
me
at
the
holborn
and
we
started
off
together
in
hansom
whatever
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
watson
he
asked
in
undisguised
wonder
as
we
rattled
through
the
crowded
london
streets
you
are
as
thin
as
lath
and
as
brown
as
nut
gave
him
short
sketch
of
my
adventures
and
had
hardly
concluded
it
by
the
time
that
we
reached
our
destination
poor
devil
he
said
commiseratingly
after
he
had
listened
to
my
misfortunes
what
are
you
up
to
now
looking
for
lodgings
answered
trying
to
solve
the
problem
as
to
whether
it
is
possible
to
get
comfortable
rooms
at
reasonable
price
that
strange
thing
remarked
my
companion
you
are
the
second
man
to
day
that
has
used
that
expression
to
me
and
who
was
the
first
asked
fellow
who
is
working
at
the
chemical
laboratory
up
at
the
hospital
he
was
bemoaning
himself
this
morning
because
he
could
not
get
someone
to
go
halves
with
him
in
some
nice
rooms
which
he
had
found
and
which
were
too
much
for
his
purse
by
jove
cried
if
he
really
wants
someone
to
share
the
rooms
and
the
expense
am
the
very
man
for
him
should
prefer
having
partner
to
being
alone
young
stamford
looked
rather
strangely
at
me
over
his
wine
glass
you
don
know
sherlock
holmes
yet
he
said
perhaps
you
would
not
care
for
him
as
constant
companion
why
what
is
there
against
him
oh
didn
say
there
was
anything
against
him
he
is
little
queer
in
his
ideas
an
enthusiast
in
some
branches
of
science
as
far
as
know
he
is
decent
fellow
enough
medical
student
suppose
said
no
have
no
idea
what
he
intends
to
go
in
for
believe
he
is
well
up
in
anatomy
and
he
is
first
class
chemist
but
as
far
as
know
he
has
never
taken
out
any
systematic
medical
classes
his
studies
are
very
desultory
and
eccentric
but
he
has
amassed
lot
of
out
of
the
way
knowledge
which
would
astonish
his
professors
did
you
never
ask
him
what
he
was
going
in
for
asked
no
he
is
not
man
that
it
is
easy
to
draw
out
though
he
can
be
communicative
enough
when
the
fancy
seizes
him
should
like
to
meet
him
said
if
am
to
lodge
with
anyone
should
prefer
man
of
studious
and
quiet
habits
am
not
strong
enough
yet
to
stand
much
noise
or
excitement
had
enough
of
both
in
afghanistan
to
last
me
for
the
remainder
of
my
natural
existence
how
could
meet
this
friend
of
yours
he
is
sure
to
be
at
the
laboratory
returned
my
companion
he
either
avoids
the
place
for
weeks
or
else
he
works
there
from
morning
to
night
if
you
like
we
shall
drive
round
together
after
luncheon
certainly
answered
and
the
conversation
drifted
away
into
other
channels
as
we
made
our
way
to
the
hospital
after
leaving
the
holborn
stamford
gave
me
few
more
particulars
about
the
gentleman
whom
proposed
to
take
as
fellow
lodger
you
mustn
blame
me
if
you
don
get
on
with
him
he
said
know
nothing
more
of
him
than
have
learned
from
meeting
him
occasionally
in
the
laboratory
you
proposed
this
arrangement
so
you
must
not
hold
me
responsible
if
we
don
get
on
it
will
be
easy
to
part
company
answered
it
seems
to
me
stamford
added
looking
hard
at
my
companion
that
you
have
some
reason
for
washing
your
hands
of
the
matter
is
this
fellow
temper
so
formidable
or
what
is
it
don
be
mealy
mouthed
about
it
is
not
easy
to
express
the
inexpressible
he
answered
with
laugh
holmes
is
little
too
scientific
for
my
tastes
it
approaches
to
cold
bloodedness
could
imagine
his
giving
friend
little
pinch
of
the
latest
vegetable
alkaloid
not
out
of
malevolence
you
understand
but
simply
out
of
spirit
of
inquiry
in
order
to
have
an
accurate
idea
of
the
effects
to
do
him
justice
think
that
he
would
take
it
himself
with
the
same
readiness
he
appears
to
have
passion
for
definite
and
exact
knowledge
very
right
too
yes
but
it
may
be
pushed
to
excess
when
it
comes
to
beating
the
subjects
in
the
dissecting
rooms
with
stick
it
is
certainly
taking
rather
bizarre
shape
beating
the
subjects
yes
to
verify
how
far
bruises
may
be
produced
after
death
saw
him
at
it
with
my
own
eyes
and
yet
you
say
he
is
not
medical
student
no
heaven
knows
what
the
objects
of
his
studies
are
but
here
we
are
and
you
must
form
your
own
impressions
about
him
as
he
spoke
we
turned
down
narrow
lane
and
passed
through
small
side
door
which
opened
into
wing
of
the
great
hospital
it
was
familiar
ground
to
me
and
needed
no
guiding
as
we
ascended
the
bleak
stone
staircase
and
made
our
way
down
the
long
corridor
with
its
vista
of
whitewashed
wall
and
dun
coloured
doors
near
the
further
end
low
arched
passage
branched
away
from
it
and
led
to
the
chemical
laboratory

this
was
lofty
chamber
lined
and
littered
with
countless
bottles
broad
low
tables
were
scattered
about
which
bristled
with
retorts
test
tubes
and
little
bunsen
lamps
with
their
blue
flickering
flames
there
was
only
one
student
in
the
room
who
was
bending
over
distant
table
absorbed
in
his
work
at
the
sound
of
our
steps
he
glanced
round
and
sprang
to
his
feet
with
cry
of
pleasure
ve
found
it
ve
found
it
he
shouted
to
my
companion
running
towards
us
with
test
tube
in
his
hand
have
found
re
agent
which
is
precipitated
by
haemoglobin
and
by
nothing
else
had
he
discovered
gold
mine
greater
delight
could
not
have
shone
upon
his
features
dr
watson
mr
sherlock
holmes
said
stamford
introducing
us
how
are
you
he
said
cordially
gripping
my
hand
with
strength
for
which
should
hardly
have
given
him
credit
you
have
been
in
afghanistan
perceive
how
on
earth
did
you
know
that
asked
in
astonishment
never
mind
said
he
chuckling
to
himself
the
question
now
is
about
haemoglobin
no
doubt
you
see
the
significance
of
this
discovery
of
mine
it
is
interesting
chemically
no
doubt
answered
but
practically
why
man
it
is
the
most
practical
medico
legal
discovery
for
years
don
you
see
that
it
gives
us
an
infallible
test
for
blood
stains
come
over
here
now
he
seized
me
by
the
coat
sleeve
in
his
eagerness
and
drew
me
over
to
the
table
at
which
he
had
been
working
let
us
have
some
fresh
blood
he
said
digging
long
bodkin
into
his
finger
and
drawing
off
the
resulting
drop
of
blood
in
chemical
pipette
now
add
this
small
quantity
of
blood
to
litre
of
water
you
perceive
that
the
resulting
mixture
has
the
appearance
of
pure
water
the
proportion
of
blood
cannot
be
more
than
one
in
million
have
no
doubt
however
that
we
shall
be
able
to
obtain
the
characteristic
reaction
as
he
spoke
he
threw
into
the
vessel
few
white
crystals
and
then
added
some
drops
of
transparent
fluid
in
an
instant
the
contents
assumed
dull
mahogany
colour
and
brownish
dust
was
precipitated
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
jar
ha
he
cried
clapping
his
hands
and
looking
as
delighted
as
child
with
new
toy
what
do
you
think
of
that
it
seems
to
be
very
delicate
test
remarked
beautiful
the
old
guaiacum
test
was
very
clumsy
and
uncertain
so
is
the
microscopic
examination
for
blood
corpuscles
the
latter
is
valueless
if
the
stains
are
few
hours
old
now
this
appears
to
act
as
well
whether
the
blood
is
old
or
new
had
this
test
been
invented
there
are
hundreds
of
men
now
walking
the
earth
who
would
long
ago
have
paid
the
penalty
of
their
crimes
indeed
murmured
criminal
cases
are
continually
hinging
upon
that
one
point
man
is
suspected
of
crime
months
perhaps
after
it
has
been
committed
his
linen
or
clothes
are
examined
and
brownish
stains
discovered
upon
them
are
they
blood
stains
or
mud
stains
or
rust
stains
or
fruit
stains
or
what
are
they
that
is
question
which
has
puzzled
many
an
expert
and
why
because
there
was
no
reliable
test
now
we
have
the
sherlock
holmes
test
and
there
will
no
longer
be
any
difficulty
his
eyes
fairly
glittered
as
he
spoke
and
he
put
his
hand
over
his
heart
and
bowed
as
if
to
some
applauding
crowd
conjured
up
by
his
imagination
you
are
to
be
congratulated
remarked
considerably
surprised
at
his
enthusiasm
there
was
the
case
of
von
bischoff
at
frankfort
last
year
he
would
certainly
have
been
hung
had
this
test
been
in
existence
then
there
was
mason
of
bradford
and
the
notorious
muller
and
lefevre
of
montpellier
and
samson
of
new
orleans
could
name
score
of
cases
in
which
it
would
have
been
decisive
you
seem
to
be
walking
calendar
of
crime
said
stamford
with
laugh
you
might
start
paper
on
those
lines
call
it
the
police
news
of
the
past
very
interesting
reading
it
might
be
made
too
remarked
sherlock
holmes
sticking
small
piece
of
plaster
over
the
prick
on
his
finger
have
to
be
careful
he
continued
turning
to
me
with
smile
for
dabble
with
poisons
good
deal
he
held
out
his
hand
as
he
spoke
and
noticed
that
it
was
all
mottled
over
with
similar
pieces
of
plaster
and
discoloured
with
strong
acids
we
came
here
on
business
said
stamford
sitting
down
on
high
three
legged
stool
and
pushing
another
one
in
my
direction
with
his
foot
my
friend
here
wants
to
take
diggings
and
as
you
were
complaining
that
you
could
get
no
one
to
go
halves
with
you
thought
that
had
better
bring
you
together
sherlock
holmes
seemed
delighted
at
the
idea
of
sharing
his
rooms
with
me
have
my
eye
on
suite
in
baker
street
he
said
which
would
suit
us
down
to
the
ground
you
don
mind
the
smell
of
strong
tobacco
hope
always
smoke
ship
myself
answered
that
good
enough
generally
have
chemicals
about
and
occasionally
do
experiments
would
that
annoy
you
by
no
means
let
me
see
what
are
my
other
shortcomings
get
in
the
dumps
at
times
and
don
open
my
mouth
for
days
on
end
you
must
not
think
am
sulky
when
do
that
just
let
me
alone
and
ll
soon
be
right
what
have
you
to
confess
now
it
just
as
well
for
two
fellows
to
know
the
worst
of
one
another
before
they
begin
to
live
together
laughed
at
this
cross
examination
keep
bull
pup
said
and
object
to
rows
because
my
nerves
are
shaken
and
get
up
at
all
sorts
of
ungodly
hours
and
am
extremely
lazy
have
another
set
of
vices
when
well
but
those
are
the
principal
ones
at
present
do
you
include
violin
playing
in
your
category
of
rows
he
asked
anxiously
it
depends
on
the
player
answered
well
played
violin
is
treat
for
the
gods
badly
played
one
oh
that
all
right
he
cried
with
merry
laugh
think
we
may
consider
the
thing
as
settled
that
is
if
the
rooms
are
agreeable
to
you
when
shall
we
see
them
call
for
me
here
at
noon
to
morrow
and
we
ll
go
together
and
settle
everything
he
answered
all
right
noon
exactly
said
shaking
his
hand
we
left
him
working
among
his
chemicals
and
we
walked
together
towards
my
hotel
by
the
way
asked
suddenly
stopping
and
turning
upon
stamford
how
the
deuce
did
he
know
that
had
come
from
afghanistan
my
companion
smiled
an
enigmatical
smile
that
just
his
little
peculiarity
he
said
good
many
people
have
wanted
to
know
how
he
finds
things
out
oh
mystery
is
it
cried
rubbing
my
hands
this
is
very
piquant
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
bringing
us
together
the
proper
study
of
mankind
is
man
you
know
you
must
study
him
then
stamford
said
as
he
bade
me
good
bye
you
ll
find
him
knotty
problem
though
ll
wager
he
learns
more
about
you
than
you
about
him
good
bye
good
bye
answered
and
strolled
on
to
my
hotel
considerably
interested
in
my
new
acquaintance
ii
the
science
of
deduction
we
met
next
day
as
he
had
arranged
and
inspected
the
rooms
at
no
221B
baker
street
of
which
he
had
spoken
at
our
meeting
they
consisted
of
couple
of
comfortable
bed
rooms
and
single
large
airy
sitting
room
cheerfully
furnished
and
illuminated
by
two
broad
windows
so
desirable
in
every
way
were
the
apartments
and
so
moderate
did
the
terms
seem
when
divided
between
us
that
the
bargain
was
concluded
upon
the
spot
and
we
at
once
entered
into
possession
that
very
evening
moved
my
things
round
from
the
hotel
and
on
the
following
morning
sherlock
holmes
followed
me
with
several
boxes
and
portmanteaus
for
day
or
two
we
were
busily
employed
in
unpacking
and
laying
out
our
property
to
the
best
advantage
that
done
we
gradually
began
to
settle
down
and
to
accommodate
ourselves
to
our
new
surroundings
holmes
was
certainly
not
difficult
man
to
live
with
he
was
quiet
in
his
ways
and
his
habits
were
regular
it
was
rare
for
him
to
be
up
after
ten
at
night
and
he
had
invariably
breakfasted
and
gone
out
before
rose
in
the
morning
sometimes
he
spent
his
day
at
the
chemical
laboratory
sometimes
in
the
dissecting
rooms
and
occasionally
in
long
walks
which
appeared
to
take
him
into
the
lowest
portions
of
the
city
nothing
could
exceed
his
energy
when
the
working
fit
was
upon
him
but
now
and
again
reaction
would
seize
him
and
for
days
on
end
he
would
lie
upon
the
sofa
in
the
sitting
room
hardly
uttering
word
or
moving
muscle
from
morning
to
night
on
these
occasions
have
noticed
such
dreamy
vacant
expression
in
his
eyes
that
might
have
suspected
him
of
being
addicted
to
the
use
of
some
narcotic
had
not
the
temperance
and
cleanliness
of
his
whole
life
forbidden
such
notion
as
the
weeks
went
by
my
interest
in
him
and
my
curiosity
as
to
his
aims
in
life
gradually
deepened
and
increased
his
very
person
and
appearance
were
such
as
to
strike
the
attention
of
the
most
casual
observer
in
height
he
was
rather
over
six
feet
and
so
excessively
lean
that
he
seemed
to
be
considerably
taller
his
eyes
were
sharp
and
piercing
save
during
those
intervals
of
torpor
to
which
have
alluded
and
his
thin
hawk
like
nose
gave
his
whole
expression
an
air
of
alertness
and
decision
his
chin
too
had
the
prominence
and
squareness
which
mark
the
man
of
determination
his
hands
were
invariably
blotted
with
ink
and
stained
with
chemicals
yet
he
was
possessed
of
extraordinary
delicacy
of
touch
as
frequently
had
occasion
to
observe
when
watched
him
manipulating
his
fragile
philosophical
instruments

the
reader
may
set
me
down
as
hopeless
busybody
when
confess
how
much
this
man
stimulated
my
curiosity
and
how
often
endeavoured
to
break
through
the
reticence
which
he
showed
on
all
that
concerned
himself
before
pronouncing
judgment
however
be
it
remembered
how
objectless
was
my
life
and
how
little
there
was
to
engage
my
attention
my
health
forbade
me
from
venturing
out
unless
the
weather
was
exceptionally
genial
and
had
no
friends
who
would
call
upon
me
and
break
the
monotony
of
my
daily
existence
under
these
circumstances
eagerly
hailed
the
little
mystery
which
hung
around
my
companion
and
spent
much
of
my
time
in
endeavouring
to
unravel
it
he
was
not
studying
medicine
he
had
himself
in
reply
to
question
confirmed
stamford
opinion
upon
that
point
neither
did
he
appear
to
have
pursued
any
course
of
reading
which
might
fit
him
for
degree
in
science
or
any
other
recognized
portal
which
would
give
him
an
entrance
into
the
learned
world
yet
his
zeal
for
certain
studies
was
remarkable
and
within
eccentric
limits
his
knowledge
was
so
extraordinarily
ample
and
minute
that
his
observations
have
fairly
astounded
me
surely
no
man
would
work
so
hard
or
attain
such
precise
information
unless
he
had
some
definite
end
in
view
desultory
readers
are
seldom
remarkable
for
the
exactness
of
their
learning
no
man
burdens
his
mind
with
small
matters
unless
he
has
some
very
good
reason
for
doing
so
his
ignorance
was
as
remarkable
as
his
knowledge
of
contemporary
literature
philosophy
and
politics
he
appeared
to
know
next
to
nothing
upon
my
quoting
thomas
carlyle
he
inquired
in
the
naivest
way
who
he
might
be
and
what
he
had
done
my
surprise
reached
climax
however
when
found
incidentally
that
he
was
ignorant
of
the
copernican
theory
and
of
the
composition
of
the
solar
system
that
any
civilized
human
being
in
this
nineteenth
century
should
not
be
aware
that
the
earth
travelled
round
the
sun
appeared
to
be
to
me
such
an
extraordinary
fact
that
could
hardly
realize
it
you
appear
to
be
astonished
he
said
smiling
at
my
expression
of
surprise
now
that
do
know
it
shall
do
my
best
to
forget
it
to
forget
it
you
see
he
explained
consider
that
man
brain
originally
is
like
little
empty
attic
and
you
have
to
stock
it
with
such
furniture
as
you
choose
fool
takes
in
all
the
lumber
of
every
sort
that
he
comes
across
so
that
the
knowledge
which
might
be
useful
to
him
gets
crowded
out
or
at
best
is
jumbled
up
with
lot
of
other
things
so
that
he
has
difficulty
in
laying
his
hands
upon
it
now
the
skilful
workman
is
very
careful
indeed
as
to
what
he
takes
into
his
brain
attic
he
will
have
nothing
but
the
tools
which
may
help
him
in
doing
his
work
but
of
these
he
has
large
assortment
and
all
in
the
most
perfect
order
it
is
mistake
to
think
that
little
room
has
elastic
walls
and
can
distend
to
any
extent
depend
upon
it
there
comes
time
when
for
every
addition
of
knowledge
you
forget
something
that
you
knew
before
it
is
of
the
highest
importance
therefore
not
to
have
useless
facts
elbowing
out
the
useful
ones
but
the
solar
system
protested
what
the
deuce
is
it
to
me
he
interrupted
impatiently
you
say
that
we
go
round
the
sun
if
we
went
round
the
moon
it
would
not
make
pennyworth
of
difference
to
me
or
to
my
work
was
on
the
point
of
asking
him
what
that
work
might
be
but
something
in
his
manner
showed
me
that
the
question
would
be
an
unwelcome
one
pondered
over
our
short
conversation
however
and
endeavoured
to
draw
my
deductions
from
it
he
said
that
he
would
acquire
no
knowledge
which
did
not
bear
upon
his
object
therefore
all
the
knowledge
which
he
possessed
was
such
as
would
be
useful
to
him
enumerated
in
my
own
mind
all
the
various
points
upon
which
he
had
shown
me
that
he
was
exceptionally
well
informed
even
took
pencil
and
jotted
them
down
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
document

had
completed
it
ran

when
had
got
so
far
in
my
list
threw
it
into
the
fire
in
despair
if
can
only
find
what
the
fellow
is
driving
at
by
reconciling
all
these
accomplishments
and
discovering
calling
which
needs
them
all
said
to
myself
may
as
well
give
up
the
attempt
at
once
see
that
have
alluded
above
to
his
powers
upon
the
violin
these
were
very
remarkable
but
as
eccentric
as
all
his
other
accomplishments
that
he
could
play
pieces
and
difficult
pieces
knew
well
because
at
my
request
he
has
played
me
some
of
mendelssohn
lieder
and
other
favourites
when
left
to
himself
however
he
would
seldom
produce
any
music
or
attempt
any
recognized
air
leaning
back
in
his
arm
chair
of
an
evening
he
would
close
his
eyes
and
scrape
carelessly
at
the
fiddle
which
was
thrown
across
his
knee
sometimes
the
chords
were
sonorous
and
melancholy
occasionally
they
were
fantastic
and
cheerful
clearly
they
reflected
the
thoughts
which
possessed
him
but
whether
the
music
aided
those
thoughts
or
whether
the
playing
was
simply
the
result
of
whim
or
fancy
was
more
than
could
determine
might
have
rebelled
against
these
exasperating
solos
had
it
not
been
that
he
usually
terminated
them
by
playing
in
quick
succession
whole
series
of
my
favourite
airs
as
slight
compensation
for
the
trial
upon
my
patience
during
the
first
week
or
so
we
had
no
callers
and
had
begun
to
think
that
my
companion
was
as
friendless
man
as
was
myself
presently
however
found
that
he
had
many
acquaintances
and
those
in
the
most
different
classes
of
society
there
was
one
little
sallow
rat
faced
dark
eyed
fellow
who
was
introduced
to
me
as
mr
lestrade
and
who
came
three
or
four
times
in
single
week
one
morning
young
girl
called
fashionably
dressed
and
stayed
for
half
an
hour
or
more
the
same
afternoon
brought
grey
headed
seedy
visitor
looking
like
jew
pedlar
who
appeared
to
me
to
be
much
excited
and
who
was
closely
followed
by
slip
shod
elderly
woman
on
another
occasion
an
old
white
haired
gentleman
had
an
interview
with
my
companion
and
on
another
railway
porter
in
his
velveteen
uniform
when
any
of
these
nondescript
individuals
put
in
an
appearance
sherlock
holmes
used
to
beg
for
the
use
of
the
sitting
room
and
would
retire
to
my
bed
room
he
always
apologized
to
me
for
putting
me
to
this
inconvenience
have
to
use
this
room
as
place
of
business
he
said
and
these
people
are
my
clients
again
had
an
opportunity
of
asking
him
point
blank
question
and
again
my
delicacy
prevented
me
from
forcing
another
man
to
confide
in
me
imagined
at
the
time
that
he
had
some
strong
reason
for
not
alluding
to
it
but
he
soon
dispelled
the
idea
by
coming
round
to
the
subject
of
his
own
accord
it
was
upon
the
4th
of
march
as
have
good
reason
to
remember
that
rose
somewhat
earlier
than
usual
and
found
that
sherlock
holmes
had
not
yet
finished
his
breakfast
the
landlady
had
become
so
accustomed
to
my
late
habits
that
my
place
had
not
been
laid
nor
my
coffee
prepared
with
the
unreasonable
petulance
of
mankind
rang
the
bell
and
gave
curt
intimation
that
was
ready
then
picked
up
magazine
from
the
table
and
attempted
to
while
away
the
time
with
it
while
my
companion
munched
silently
at
his
toast
one
of
the
articles
had
pencil
mark
at
the
heading
and
naturally
began
to
run
my
eye
through
it
its
somewhat
ambitious
title
was
the
book
of
life
and
it
attempted
to
show
how
much
an
observant
man
might
learn
by
an
accurate
and
systematic
examination
of
all
that
came
in
his
way
it
struck
me
as
being
remarkable
mixture
of
shrewdness
and
of
absurdity
the
reasoning
was
close
and
intense
but
the
deductions
appeared
to
me
to
be
far
fetched
and
exaggerated
the
writer
claimed
by
momentary
expression
twitch
of
muscle
or
glance
of
an
eye
to
fathom
man
inmost
thoughts
deceit
according
to
him
was
an
impossibility
in
the
case
of
one
trained
to
observation
and
analysis
his
conclusions
were
as
infallible
as
so
many
propositions
of
euclid
so
startling
would
his
results
appear
to
the
uninitiated
that
until
they
learned
the
processes
by
which
he
had
arrived
at
them
they
might
well
consider
him
as
necromancer

the

what

never

such
rubbish
in

what
is
it
asked
sherlock
holmes
why
this
article
said
pointing
at
it
with
my
egg
spoon
as
sat
down
to
my
breakfast
see
that
you
have
read
it
since
you
have
marked
it
don
deny
that
it
is
smartly
written
it
irritates
me
though
it
is
evidently
the
theory
of
some
arm
chair
lounger
who
evolves
all
these
neat
little
paradoxes
in
the
seclusion
of
his
own
study
it
is
not
practical
should
like
to
see
him
clapped
down
in
third
class
carriage
on
the
underground
and
asked
to
give
the
trades
of
all
his
fellow
travellers
would
lay
thousand
to
one
against
him
you
would
lose
your
money
sherlock
holmes
remarked
calmly
as
for
the
article
wrote
it
myself
you
yes
have
turn
both
for
observation
and
for
deduction
the
theories
which
have
expressed
there
and
which
appear
to
you
to
be
so
chimerical
are
really
extremely
practical
so
practical
that
depend
upon
them
for
my
bread
and
cheese
and
how
asked
involuntarily
well
have
trade
of
my
own
suppose
am
the
only
one
in
the
world
consulting
detective
if
you
can
understand
what
that
is
here
in
london
we
have
lots
of
government
detectives
and
lots
of
private
ones
when
these
fellows
are
at
fault
they
come
to
me
and
manage
to
put
them
on
the
right
scent
they
lay
all
the
evidence
before
me
and
am
generally
able
by
the
help
of
my
knowledge
of
the
history
of
crime
to
set
them
straight
there
is
strong
family
resemblance
about
misdeeds
and
if
you
have
all
the
details
of
thousand
at
your
finger
ends
it
is
odd
if
you
can
unravel
the
thousand
and
first
lestrade
is
well
known
detective
he
got
himself
into
fog
recently
over
forgery
case
and
that
was
what
brought
him
here
and
these
other
people
they
are
mostly
sent
on
by
private
inquiry
agencies
they
are
all
people
who
are
in
trouble
about
something
and
want
little
enlightening
listen
to
their
story
they
listen
to
my
comments
and
then
pocket
my
fee
but
do
you
mean
to
say
said
that
without
leaving
your
room
you
can
unravel
some
knot
which
other
men
can
make
nothing
of
although
they
have
seen
every
detail
for
themselves
quite
so
have
kind
of
intuition
that
way
now
and
again
case
turns
up
which
is
little
more
complex
then
have
to
bustle
about
and
see
things
with
my
own
eyes
you
see
have
lot
of
special
knowledge
which
apply
to
the
problem
and
which
facilitates
matters
wonderfully
those
rules
of
deduction
laid
down
in
that
article
which
aroused
your
scorn
are
invaluable
to
me
in
practical
work
observation
with
me
is
second
nature
you
appeared
to
be
surprised
when
told
you
on
our
first
meeting
that
you
had
come
from
afghanistan
you
were
told
no
doubt
nothing
of
the
sort
knew
you
came
from
afghanistan
from
long
habit
the
train
of
thoughts
ran
so
swiftly
through
my
mind
that
arrived
at
the
conclusion
without
being
conscious
of
intermediate
steps
there
were
such
steps
however
the
train
of
reasoning
ran
here
is

medical
type
but
with
the
air
of

clearly

then
he
has
just
come
from
the
tropics
for
his

hardship
and
sickness
as
his
haggard
face
says
clearly
his
left
arm
has
been
injured
he
holds
it
in
stiff
and
unnatural
manner
where
in
the
tropics
could
an
english
army
doctor
have
seen
much
hardship
and
got
his
arm
wounded
clearly
in
afghanistan
the
whole
train
of
thought
did
not
occupy
second
then
remarked
that
you
came
from
afghanistan
and
you
were
astonished
it
is
simple
enough
as
you
explain
it
said
smiling
you
remind
me
of
edgar
allen
poe
dupin
had
no
idea
that
such
individuals
did
exist
outside
of
stories
sherlock
holmes
rose
and
lit
his
pipe
no
doubt
you
think
that
you
are
complimenting
me
in
comparing
me
to
dupin
he
observed
now
in
my
opinion
dupin
was
very
inferior
fellow
that
trick
of
his
of
breaking
in
on
his
friends
thoughts
with
an
apropos
remark
after
quarter
of
an
hour
silence
is
really
very
showy
and
superficial
he
had
some
analytical
genius
no
doubt
but
he
was
by
no
means
such
phenomenon
as
poe
appeared
to
imagine
have
you
read
gaboriau
works
asked
does
lecoq
come
up
to
your
idea
of
detective
sherlock
holmes
sniffed
sardonically
lecoq
was
miserable
bungler
he
said
in
an
angry
voice
he
had
only
one
thing
to
recommend
him
and
that
was
his
energy
that
book
made
me
positively
ill
the
question
was
how
to
identify
an
unknown
prisoner
could
have
done
it
in
twenty
four
hours
lecoq
took
six
months
or
so
it
might
be
made
text
book
for
detectives
to
teach
them
what
to
avoid
felt
rather
indignant
at
having
two
characters
whom
had
admired
treated
in
this
cavalier
style
walked
over
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
out
into
the
busy
street
this
fellow
may
be
very
clever
said
to
myself
but
he
is
certainly
very
conceited
there
are
no
crimes
and
no
criminals
in
these
days
he
said
querulously
what
is
the
use
of
having
brains
in
our
profession
know
well
that
have
it
in
me
to
make
my
name
famous
no
man
lives
or
has
ever
lived
who
has
brought
the
same
amount
of
study
and
of
natural
talent
to
the
detection
of
crime
which
have
done
and
what
is
the
result
there
is
no
crime
to
detect
or
at
most
some
bungling
villainy
with
motive
so
transparent
that
even
scotland
yard
official
can
see
through
it
was
still
annoyed
at
his
bumptious
style
of
conversation
thought
it
best
to
change
the
topic
wonder
what
that
fellow
is
looking
for
asked
pointing
to
stalwart
plainly
dressed
individual
who
was
walking
slowly
down
the
other
side
of
the
street
looking
anxiously
at
the
numbers
he
had
large
blue
envelope
in
his
hand
and
was
evidently
the
bearer
of
message
you
mean
the
retired
sergeant
of
marines
said
sherlock
holmes
brag
and
bounce
thought
to
myself
he
knows
that
cannot
verify
his
guess
the
thought
had
hardly
passed
through
my
mind
when
the
man
whom
we
were
watching
caught
sight
of
the
number
on
our
door
and
ran
rapidly
across
the
roadway
we
heard
loud
knock
deep
voice
below
and
heavy
steps
ascending
the
stair
for
mr
sherlock
holmes
he
said
stepping
into
the
room
and
handing
my
friend
the
letter
here
was
an
opportunity
of
taking
the
conceit
out
of
him
he
little
thought
of
this
when
he
made
that
random
shot
may
ask
my
lad
said
in
the
blandest
voice
what
your
trade
may
be
commissionaire
sir
he
said
gruffly
uniform
away
for
repairs
and
you
were
asked
with
slightly
malicious
glance
at
my
companion
sergeant
sir
royal
marine
light
infantry
sir
no
answer
right
sir
he
clicked
his
heels
together
raised
his
hand
in
salute
and
was
gone
iii
the
lauriston
garden
mystery
confess
that
was
considerably
startled
by
this
fresh
proof
of
the
practical
nature
of
my
companion
theories
my
respect
for
his
powers
of
analysis
increased
wondrously
there
still
remained
some
lurking
suspicion
in
my
mind
however
that
the
whole
thing
was
pre
arranged
episode
intended
to
dazzle
me
though
what
earthly
object
he
could
have
in
taking
me
in
was
past
my
comprehension
when
looked
at
him
he
had
finished
reading
the
note
and
his
eyes
had
assumed
the
vacant
lack
lustre
expression
which
showed
mental
abstraction
how
in
the
world
did
you
deduce
that
asked

deduce
what
said
he
petulantly
why
that
he
was
retired
sergeant
of
marines
have
no
time
for
trifles
he
answered
brusquely
then
with
smile
excuse
my
rudeness
you
broke
the
thread
of
my
thoughts
but
perhaps
it
is
as
well
so
you
actually
were
not
able
to
see
that
man
was
sergeant
of
marines
no
indeed
it
was
easier
to
know
it
than
to
explain
why
knew
it
if
you
were
asked
to
prove
that
two
and
two
made
four
you
might
find
some
difficulty
and
yet
you
are
quite
sure
of
the
fact
even
across
the
street
could
see
great
blue
anchor
tattooed
on
the
back
of
the
fellow
hand
that
smacked
of
the
sea
he
had
military
carriage
however
and
regulation
side
whiskers
there
we
have
the
marine
he
was
man
with
some
amount
of
self
importance
and
certain
air
of
command
you
must
have
observed
the
way
in
which
he
held
his
head
and
swung
his
cane
steady
respectable
middle
aged
man
too
on
the
face
of
him
all
facts
which
led
me
to
believe
that
he
had
been
sergeant
wonderful
ejaculated
commonplace
said
holmes
though
thought
from
his
expression
that
he
was
pleased
at
my
evident
surprise
and
admiration
said
just
now
that
there
were
no
criminals
it
appears
that
am
wrong
look
at
this
he
threw
me
over
the
note
which
the
commissionaire
had
brought
why
cried
as
cast
my
eye
over
it
this
is
terrible
it
does
seem
to
be
little
out
of
the
common
he
remarked
calmly
would
you
mind
reading
it
to
me
aloud
this
is
the
letter
which
read
to
him
my
dear
mr
sherlock
holmes
there
has
been
bad
business
during
the
night
at
lauriston
gardens
off
the
brixton
road
our
man
on
the
beat
saw
light
there
about
two
in
the
morning
and
as
the
house
was
an
empty
one
suspected
that
something
was
amiss
he
found
the
door
open
and
in
the
front
room
which
is
bare
of
furniture
discovered
the
body
of
gentleman
well
dressed
and
having
cards
in
his
pocket
bearing
the
name
of
enoch
drebber
cleveland
ohio
there
had
been
no
robbery
nor
is
there
any
evidence
as
to
how
the
man
met
his
death
there
are
marks
of
blood
in
the
room
but
there
is
no
wound
upon
his
person
we
are
at
loss
as
to
how
he
came
into
the
empty
house
indeed
the
whole
affair
is
puzzler
if
you
can
come
round
to
the
house
any
time
before
twelve
you
will
find
me
there
have
left
everything
in
statu
quo
until
hear
from
you
if
you
are
unable
to
come
shall
give
you
fuller
details
and
would
esteem
it
great
kindness
if
you
would
favour
me
with
your
opinion
yours
faithfully—
tobias
gregson
is
the
smartest
of
the
scotland
yarders
my
friend
remarked
he
and
lestrade
are
the
pick
of
bad
lot
they
are
both
quick
and
energetic
but
conventional
shockingly
so
they
have
their
knives
into
one
another
too
they
are
as
jealous
as
pair
of
professional
beauties
there
will
be
some
fun
over
this
case
if
they
are
both
put
upon
the
scent
was
amazed
at
the
calm
way
in
which
he
rippled
on
surely
there
is
not
moment
to
be
lost
cried
shall
go
and
order
you
cab
not
sure
about
whether
shall
go
am
the
most
incurably
lazy
devil
that
ever
stood
in
shoe
leather
that
is
when
the
fit
is
on
me
for
can
be
spry
enough
at
times
why
it
is
just
such
chance
as
you
have
been
longing
for
my
dear
fellow
what
does
it
matter
to
me
supposing
unravel
the
whole
matter
you
may
be
sure
that
gregson
lestrade
and
co
will
pocket
all
the
credit
that
comes
of
being
an
unofficial
personage
but
he
begs
you
to
help
him
yes
he
knows
that
am
his
superior
and
acknowledges
it
to
me
but
he
would
cut
his
tongue
out
before
he
would
own
it
to
any
third
person
however
we
may
as
well
go
and
have
look
shall
work
it
out
on
my
own
hook
may
have
laugh
at
them
if
have
nothing
else
come
on
he
hustled
on
his
overcoat
and
bustled
about
in
way
that
showed
that
an
energetic
fit
had
superseded
the
apathetic
one
get
your
hat
he
said
you
wish
me
to
come
yes
if
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
minute
later
we
were
both
in
hansom
driving
furiously
for
the
brixton
road
it
was
foggy
cloudy
morning
and
dun
coloured
veil
hung
over
the
house
tops
looking
like
the
reflection
of
the
mud
coloured
streets
beneath
my
companion
was
in
the
best
of
spirits
and
prattled
away
about
cremona
fiddles
and
the
difference
between
stradivarius
and
an
amati
as
for
myself
was
silent
for
the
dull
weather
and
the
melancholy
business
upon
which
we
were
engaged
depressed
my
spirits
you
don
seem
to
give
much
thought
to
the
matter
in
hand
said
at
last
interrupting
holmes
musical
disquisition
no
data
yet
he
answered
it
is
capital
mistake
to
theorize
before
you
have
all
the
evidence
it
biases
the
judgment
you
will
have
your
data
soon
remarked
pointing
with
my
finger
this
is
the
brixton
road
and
that
is
the
house
if
am
not
very
much
mistaken
so
it
is
stop
driver
stop
we
were
still
hundred
yards
or
so
from
it
but
he
insisted
upon
our
alighting
and
we
finished
our
journey
upon
foot
number
lauriston
gardens
wore
an
ill
omened
and
minatory
look
it
was
one
of
four
which
stood
back
some
little
way
from
the
street
two
being
occupied
and
two
empty
the
latter
looked
out
with
three
tiers
of
vacant
melancholy
windows
which
were
blank
and
dreary
save
that
here
and
there
to
let
card
had
developed
like
cataract
upon
the
bleared
panes
small
garden
sprinkled
over
with
scattered
eruption
of
sickly
plants
separated
each
of
these
houses
from
the
street
and
was
traversed
by
narrow
pathway
yellowish
in
colour
and
consisting
apparently
of
mixture
of
clay
and
of
gravel
the
whole
place
was
very
sloppy
from
the
rain
which
had
fallen
through
the
night
the
garden
was
bounded
by
three
foot
brick
wall
with
fringe
of
wood
rails
upon
the
top
and
against
this
wall
was
leaning
stalwart
police
constable
surrounded
by
small
knot
of
loafers
who
craned
their
necks
and
strained
their
eyes
in
the
vain
hope
of
catching
some
glimpse
of
the
proceedings
within
had
imagined
that
sherlock
holmes
would
at
once
have
hurried
into
the
house
and
plunged
into
study
of
the
mystery
nothing
appeared
to
be
further
from
his
intention
with
an
air
of
nonchalance
which
under
the
circumstances
seemed
to
me
to
border
upon
affectation
he
lounged
up
and
down
the
pavement
and
gazed
vacantly
at
the
ground
the
sky
the
opposite
houses
and
the
line
of
railings
having
finished
his
scrutiny
he
proceeded
slowly
down
the
path
or
rather
down
the
fringe
of
grass
which
flanked
the
path
keeping
his
eyes
riveted
upon
the
ground
twice
he
stopped
and
once
saw
him
smile
and
heard
him
utter
an
exclamation
of
satisfaction
there
were
many
marks
of
footsteps
upon
the
wet
clayey
soil
but
since
the
police
had
been
coming
and
going
over
it
was
unable
to
see
how
my
companion
could
hope
to
learn
anything
from
it
still
had
such
extraordinary
evidence
of
the
quickness
of
his
perceptive
faculties
that
had
no
doubt
that
he
could
see
great
deal
which
was
hidden
from
me
at
the
door
of
the
house
we
were
met
by
tall
white
faced
flaxen
haired
man
with
notebook
in
his
hand
who
rushed
forward
and
wrung
my
companion
hand
with
effusion
it
is
indeed
kind
of
you
to
come
he
said
have
had
everything
left
untouched
except
that
my
friend
answered
pointing
at
the
pathway
if
herd
of
buffaloes
had
passed
along
there
could
not
be
greater
mess
no
doubt
however
you
had
drawn
your
own
conclusions
gregson
before
you
permitted
this
have
had
so
much
to
do
inside
the
house
the
detective
said
evasively
my
colleague
mr
lestrade
is
here
had
relied
upon
him
to
look
after
this
holmes
glanced
at
me
and
raised
his
eyebrows
sardonically
with
two
such
men
as
yourself
and
lestrade
upon
the
ground
there
will
not
be
much
for
third
party
to
find
out
he
said
gregson
rubbed
his
hands
in
self
satisfied
way
think
we
have
done
all
that
can
be
done
he
answered
it
queer
case
though
and
knew
your
taste
for
such
things
you
did
not
come
here
in
cab
asked
sherlock
holmes
no
sir
nor
lestrade
no
sir
then
let
us
go
and
look
at
the
room
with
which
inconsequent
remark
he
strode
on
into
the
house
followed
by
gregson
whose
features
expressed
his
astonishment
short
passage
bare
planked
and
dusty
led
to
the
kitchen
and
offices
two
doors
opened
out
of
it
to
the
left
and
to
the
right
one
of
these
had
obviously
been
closed
for
many
weeks
the
other
belonged
to
the
dining
room
which
was
the
apartment
in
which
the
mysterious
affair
had
occurred
holmes
walked
in
and
followed
him
with
that
subdued
feeling
at
my
heart

the
presence

it
was
large

room
looking
all
the
larger
from
the
absence
of
all
furniture
vulgar
flaring
paper
adorned
the
walls
but
it
was
blotched
in
places
with
mildew
and
here
and
there
great
strips
had
become
detached
and
hung
down
exposing
the
yellow

fireplace
surmounted
by
mantelpiece
of
imitation
white
marble
on
one
corner
of
this
was
stuck
the
stump
of
red
wax
candle
the
solitary
window
was
so
dirty
that
the
light
was
hazy
and
uncertain
giving
dull
grey
tinge
to
everything
which
was
intensified
by
the
thick
layer
of
dust
which
coated
the
whole
apartment
all
these
details
observed
afterwards
at
present
my
attention
was
centred
upon
the
single
grim
motionless
figure
which
lay
stretched
upon
the
boards
with
vacant
sightless
eyes
staring
up
at
the
discoloured
ceiling
it
was
that
of
man
about
forty
three
or
forty
four
years
of
age
middle
sized
broad
shouldered
with
crisp
curling
black
hair
and
short
stubbly
beard
he
was
dressed
in
heavy
broadcloth
frock
coat
and
waistcoat
with
light
coloured
trousers
and
immaculate
collar
and
cuffs
top
hat
well
brushed
and
trim
was
placed
upon
the
floor
beside
him
his
hands
were
clenched
and
his
arms
thrown
abroad
while
his
lower
limbs
were
interlocked
as
though
his
death
struggle
had
been
grievous
one
on
his
rigid
face
there
stood
an
expression
of
horror
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
of
hatred
such
as
have
never
seen
upon
human
features
this
malignant
and
terrible
contortion
combined
with
the
low
forehead
blunt
nose
and
prognathous
jaw
gave
the
dead
man
singularly
simious
and
ape
like
appearance
which
was
increased
by
his
writhing
unnatural
posture
have
seen
death
in
many
forms
but
never
has
it
appeared
to
me
in
more
fearsome
aspect
than
in
that
dark
grimy
apartment
which
looked
out
upon
one
of
the
main
arteries
of
suburban
london
lestrade
lean
and
ferret
like
as
ever
was
standing
by
the
doorway
and
greeted
my
companion
and
myself
this
case
will
make
stir
sir
he
remarked
it
beats
anything
have
seen
and
am
no
chicken
there
is
no
clue
said
gregson
none
at
all
chimed
in
lestrade
sherlock
holmes
approached
the
body
and
kneeling
down
examined
it
intently
you
are
sure
that
there
is
no
wound
he
asked
pointing
to
numerous
gouts
and
splashes
of
blood
which
lay
all
round
positive
cried
both
detectives
then
of
course
this
blood
belongs
to
second
individual
presumably
the
murderer
if
murder
has
been
committed
it
reminds
me
of
the
circumstances
attendant
on
the
death
of
van
jansen
in
utrecht
in
the
year
34
do
you
remember
the
case
gregson
no
sir
read
it
up
you
really
should
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
it
has
all
been
done
before
as
he
spoke
his
nimble
fingers
were
flying
here
there
and
everywhere
feeling
pressing
unbuttoning
examining
while
his
eyes
wore
the
same
far
away
expression
which
have
already
remarked
upon
so
swiftly
was
the
examination
made
that
one
would
hardly
have
guessed
the
minuteness
with
which
it
was
conducted
finally
he
sniffed
the
dead
man
lips
and
then
glanced
at
the
soles
of
his
patent
leather
boots
he
has
not
been
moved
at
all
he
asked
no
more
than
was
necessary
for
the
purposes
of
our
examination
you
can
take
him
to
the
mortuary
now
he
said
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
learned
gregson
had
stretcher
and
four
men
at
hand
at
his
call
they
entered
the
room
and
the
stranger
was
lifted
and
carried
out
as
they
raised
him
ring
tinkled
down
and
rolled
across
the
floor
lestrade
grabbed
it
up
and
stared
at
it
with
mystified
eyes
there
been
woman
here
he
cried
it
woman
wedding
ring
he
held
it
out
as
he
spoke
upon
the
palm
of
his
hand
we
all
gathered
round
him
and
gazed
at
it
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
circlet
of
plain
gold
had
once
adorned
the
finger
of
bride
this
complicates
matters
said
gregson
heaven
knows
they
were
complicated
enough
before
you
re
sure
it
doesn
simplify
them
observed
holmes
there
nothing
to
be
learned
by
staring
at
it
what
did
you
find
in
his
pockets
we
have
it
all
here
said
gregson

to

are
both

and
refer
to

it
is
clear
that
this
unfortunate
man
was
about
to
return
to
new
york
have
you
made
any
inquiries
as
to
this
man
stangerson
did
it
at
once
sir
said
gregson
have
had
advertisements
sent
to
all
the
newspapers
and
one
of
my
men
has
gone
to
the
american
exchange
but
he
has
not
returned
yet
have
you
sent
to
cleveland
we
telegraphed
this
morning
how
did
you
word
your
inquiries
we
simply
detailed
the
circumstances
and
said
that
we
should
be
glad
of
any
information
which
could
help
us
you
did
not
ask
for
particulars
on
any
point
which
appeared
to
you
to
be
crucial
asked
about
stangerson
nothing
else
is
there
no
circumstance
on
which
this
whole
case
appears
to
hinge
will
you
not
telegraph
again
have
said
all
have
to
say
said
gregson
in
an
offended
voice
sherlock
holmes
chuckled
to
himself
and
appeared
to
be
about
to
make
some
remark
when
lestrade
who
had
been
in
the
front
room
while
we
were
holding
this
conversation
in
the
hall
reappeared
upon
the
scene
rubbing
his
hands
in
pompous
and
self
satisfied
manner
mr
gregson
he
said
have
just
made
discovery
of
the
highest
importance
and
one
which
would
have
been
overlooked
had
not
made
careful
examination
of
the
walls
the
little
man
eyes
sparkled
as
he
spoke
and
he
was
evidently
in
state
of
suppressed
exultation
at
having
scored
point
against
his
colleague
come
here
he
said
bustling
back
into
the
room
the
atmosphere
of
which
felt
clearer
since
the
removal
of
its
ghastly
inmate
now
stand
there
he
struck
match
on
his
boot
and
held
it
up
against
the
wall
look
at
that
he
said
triumphantly
have
remarked
that
the
paper
had
fallen
away
in
parts
in
this
particular
corner
of
the
room
large
piece
had
peeled
off
leaving
yellow
square
of
coarse
plastering
across
this
bare
space
there
was
scrawled
in
blood
red
letters
single
word
rache
what
do
you
think
of
that
cried
the
detective
with
the
air
of
showman
exhibiting
his
show
this
was
overlooked
because
it
was
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
room
and
no
one
thought
of
looking
there
the
murderer
has
written
it
with
his
or
her
own
blood
see
this
smear
where
it
has
trickled
down
the
wall
that
disposes
of
the
idea
of
suicide
anyhow
why
was
that
corner
chosen
to
write
it
on
will
tell
you
see
that
candle
on
the
mantelpiece
it
was
lit
at
the
time
and
if
it
was
lit
this
corner
would
be
the
brightest
instead
of
the
darkest
portion
of
the
wall
and
what
does
it
mean
now
that
you
have
found
it
asked
gregson
in
depreciatory
voice
mean
why
it
means
that
the
writer
was
going
to
put
the
female
name
rachel
but
was
disturbed
before
he
or
she
had
time
to
finish
you
mark
my
words
when
this
case
comes
to
be
cleared
up
you
will
find
that
woman
named
rachel
has
something
to
do
with
it
all
very
well
for
you
to
laugh
mr
sherlock
holmes
you
may
be
very
smart
and
clever
but
the
old
hound
is
the
best
when
all
is
said
and
done
really
beg
your
pardon
said
my
companion
who
had
ruffled
the
little
man
temper
by
bursting
into
an
explosion
of
laughter
you
certainly
have
the
credit
of
being
the
first
of
us
to
find
this
out
and
as
you
say
it
bears
every
mark
of
having
been
written
by
the
other
participant
in
last
night
mystery
have
not
had
time
to
examine
this
room
yet
but
with
your
permission
shall
do
so
now
as
he
spoke
he
whipped
tape
measure
and
large
round
magnifying
glass
from
his
pocket
with
these
two
implements
he
trotted
noiselessly
about
the
room
sometimes
stopping
occasionally
kneeling
and
once
lying
flat
upon
his
face
so
engrossed
was
he
with
his
occupation
that
he
appeared
to
have
forgotten
our
presence
for
he
chattered
away
to
himself
under
his
breath
the
whole
time
keeping
up
running
fire
of
exclamations
groans
whistles
and
little
cries
suggestive
of
encouragement
and
of
hope
as
watched
him
was
irresistibly
reminded
of
pure
blooded
well
trained
foxhound
as
it
dashes
backwards
and
forwards
through
the
covert
whining
in
its
eagerness
until
it
comes
across
the
lost
scent
for
twenty
minutes
or
more
he
continued
his
researches
measuring
with
the
most
exact
care
the
distance
between
marks
which
were
entirely
invisible
to
me
and
occasionally
applying
his
tape
to
the
walls
in
an
equally
incomprehensible
manner
in
one
place
he
gathered
up
very
carefully
little
pile
of
grey
dust
from
the
floor
and
packed
it
away
in
an
envelope
finally
he
examined
with
his
glass
the
word
upon
the
wall
going
over
every
letter
of
it
with
the
most
minute
exactness
this
done
he
appeared
to
be
satisfied
for
he
replaced
his
tape
and
his
glass
in
his
pocket

they
say
that
genius
is
an
infinite
capacity
for
taking
pains
he
remarked
with
smile
it
very
bad
definition
but
it
does
apply
to
detective
work
gregson
and
lestrade
had
watched
the
manoeuvres
of
their
amateur
companion
with
considerable
curiosity
and
some
contempt
they
evidently
failed
to
appreciate
the
fact
which
had
begun
to
realize
that
sherlock
holmes
smallest
actions
were
all
directed
towards
some
definite
and
practical
end
what
do
you
think
of
it
sir
they
both
asked
it
would
be
robbing
you
of
the
credit
of
the
case
if
was
to
presume
to
help
you
remarked
my
friend
you
are
doing
so
well
now
that
it
would
be
pity
for
anyone
to
interfere
there
was
world
of
sarcasm
in
his
voice
as
he
spoke
if
you
will
let
me
know
how
your
investigations
go
he
continued
shall
be
happy
to
give
you
any
help
can
in
the
meantime
should
like
to
speak
to
the
constable
who
found
the
body
can
you
give
me
his
name
and
address
lestrade
glanced
at
his
note
book
john
rance
he
said
he
is
off
duty
now
you
will
find
him
at
46
audley
court
kennington
park
gate
holmes
took
note
of
the
address
come
along
doctor
he
said
we
shall
go
and
look
him
up
ll
tell
you
one
thing
which
may
help
you
in
the
case
he
continued
turning
to
the
two
detectives
there
has
been
murder
done
and
the
murderer
was
man
he
was
more
than
six
feet
high
was
in
the
prime
of
life
had
small
feet
for
his
height
wore
coarse
square
toed
boots
and
smoked
trichinopoly
cigar
he
came
here
with
his
victim
in
four
wheeled
cab
which
was
drawn
by
horse
with
three
old
shoes
and
one
new
one
on
his
off
fore
leg
in
all
probability
the
murderer
had
florid
face
and
the
finger
nails
of
his
right
hand
were
remarkably
long
these
are
only
few
indications
but
they
may
assist
you
lestrade
and
gregson
glanced
at
each
other
with
an
incredulous
smile
if
this
man
was
murdered
how
was
it
done
asked
the
former
poison
said
sherlock
holmes
curtly
and
strode
off
one
other
thing
lestrade
he
added
turning
round
at
the
door
rache
is
the
german
for
revenge
so
don
lose
your
time
looking
for
miss
rachel
with
which
parthian
shot
he
walked
away
leaving
the
two
rivals
open
mouthed
behind
him
iv
what
john
rance
had
to
tell
it
was
one
clock
when
we
left
no
lauriston
gardens
sherlock
holmes
led
me
to
the
nearest
telegraph
office
whence
he
dispatched
long
telegram
he
then
hailed
cab
and
ordered
the
driver
to
take
us
to
the
address
given
us
by
lestrade
there
is
nothing
like
first
hand
evidence
he
remarked
as
matter
of
fact
my
mind
is
entirely
made
up
upon
the
case
but
still
we
may
as
well
learn
all
that
is
to
be
learned
you
amaze
me
holmes
said
surely
you
are
not
as
sure
as
you
pretend
to
be
of
all
those
particulars
which
you
gave
there
no
room
for
mistake
he
answered
the
very
first
thing
which
observed
on
arriving
there
was
that
cab
had
made
two
ruts
with
its
wheels
close
to
the
curb
now
up
to
last
night
we
have
had
no
rain
for
week
so
that
those
wheels
which
left
such
deep
impression
must
have
been
there
during
the
night
there
were
the
marks
of
the
horse
hoofs
too
the
outline
of
one
of
which
was
far
more
clearly
cut
than
that
of
the
other
three
showing
that
was
new
shoe
since
the
cab
was
there
after
the
rain
began
and
was
not
there
at
any
time
during
the
morning
have
gregson
word
for
that
it
follows
that
it
must
have
been
there
during
the
night
and
therefore
that
it
brought
those
two
individuals
to
the
house
that
seems
simple
enough
said
but
how
about
the
other
man
height
why
the
height
of
man
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
can
be
told
from
the
length
of
his
stride
it
is
simple
calculation
enough
though
there
is
no
use
my
boring
you
with
figures
had
this
fellow
stride
both
on
the
clay
outside
and
on
the
dust
within
then
had
way
of
checking
my
calculation
when
man
writes
on
wall
his
instinct
leads
him
to
write
about
the
level
of
his
own
eyes
now
that
writing
was
just
over
six
feet
from
the
ground
it
was
child
play
and
his
age
asked
well
if
man
can
stride
four
and
half
feet
without
the
smallest
effort
he
can
be
quite
in
the
sere
and
yellow
that
was
the
breadth
of
puddle
on
the
garden
walk
which
he
had
evidently
walked
across
patent
leather
boots
had
gone
round
and
square
toes
had
hopped
over
there
is
no
mystery
about
it
at
all
am
simply
applying
to
ordinary
life
few
of
those
precepts
of
observation
and
deduction
which
advocated
in
that
article
is
there
anything
else
that
puzzles
you
the
finger
nails
and
the
trichinopoly
suggested
the
writing
on
the
wall
was
done
with
man
forefinger
dipped
in
blood
my
glass
allowed
me
to
observe
that
the
plaster
was
slightly
scratched
in
doing
it
which
would
not
have
been
the
case
if
the
man
nail
had
been
trimmed
gathered
up
some
scattered
ash
from
the
floor
it
was
dark
in
colour
and
flakey
such
an
ash
as
is
only
made
by
trichinopoly
have
made
special
study
of
cigar
ashes
in
fact
have
written
monograph
upon
the
subject
flatter
myself
that
can
distinguish
at
glance
the
ash
of
any
known
brand
either
of
cigar
or
of
tobacco
it
is
just
in
such
details
that
the
skilled
detective
differs
from
the
gregson
and
lestrade
type
and
the
florid
face
asked
ah
that
was
more
daring
shot
though
have
no
doubt
that
was
right
you
must
not
ask
me
that
at
the
present
state
of
the
affair
passed
my
hand
over
my
brow
my
head
is
in
whirl
remarked
the
more
one
thinks
of
it
the
more
mysterious
it
grows
how
came
these
two
men
if
there
were
two
men
into
an
empty
house
what
has
become
of
the
cabman
who
drove
them
how
could
one
man
compel
another
to
take
poison
where
did
the
blood
come
from
what
was
the
object
of
the
murderer
since
robbery
had
no
part
in
it
how
came
the
woman
ring
there
above
all
why
should
the
second
man
write
up
the
german
word
rache
before
decamping
confess
that
cannot
see
any
possible
way
of
reconciling
all
these
facts
my
companion
smiled
approvingly
you
sum
up
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
succinctly
and
well
he
said
there
is
much
that
is
still
obscure
though
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
on
the
main
facts
as
to
poor
lestrade
discovery
it
was
simply
blind
intended
to
put
the
police
upon
wrong
track
by
suggesting
socialism
and
secret
societies
it
was
not
done
by
german
the
if
you
noticed
was
printed
somewhat
after
the
german
fashion
now
real
german
invariably
prints
in
the
latin
character
so
that
we
may
safely
say
that
this
was
not
written
by
one
but
by
clumsy
imitator
who
overdid
his
part
it
was
simply
ruse
to
divert
inquiry
into
wrong
channel
not
going
to
tell
you
much
more
of
the
case
doctor
you
know
conjuror
gets
no
credit
when
once
he
has
explained
his
trick
and
if
show
you
too
much
of
my
method
of
working
you
will
come
to
the
conclusion
that
am
very
ordinary
individual
after
all
shall
never
do
that
answered
you
have
brought
detection
as
near
an
exact
science
as
it
ever
will
be
brought
in
this
world
my
companion
flushed
up
with
pleasure
at
my
words
and
the
earnest
way
in
which
uttered
them
had
already
observed
that
he
was
as
sensitive
to
flattery
on
the
score
of
his
art
as
any
girl
could
be
of
her
beauty
ll
tell
you
one
other
thing
he
said
patent
leathers
and
square
toes
came
in
the
same
cab
and
they
walked
down
the
pathway
together
as
friendly
as
possible
arm
in
arm
in
all
probability
when
they
got
inside
they
walked
up
and
down
the
room
or
rather
patent
leathers
stood
still
while
square
toes
walked
up
and
down
could
read
all
that
in
the
dust
and
could
read
that
as
he
walked
he
grew
more
and
more
excited
that
is
shown
by
the
increased
length
of
his
strides
he
was
talking
all
the
while
and
working
himself
up
no
doubt
into
fury
then
the
tragedy
occurred
ve
told
you
all
know
myself
now
for
the
rest
is
mere
surmise
and
conjecture
we
have
good
working
basis
however
on
which
to
start
we
must
hurry
up
for
want
to
go
to
hallé
concert
to
hear
norman
neruda
this
afternoon
this
conversation
had
occurred
while
our
cab
had
been
threading
its
way
through
long
succession
of
dingy
streets
and
dreary
by
ways
in
the
dingiest
and
dreariest
of
them
our
driver
suddenly
came
to
stand
that
audley
court
in
there
he
said
pointing
to
narrow
slit
in
the
line
of
dead
coloured
brick
you
ll
find
me
here
when
you
come
back
audley
court
was
not
an
attractive
locality
the
narrow
passage
led
us
into
quadrangle
paved
with
flags
and
lined
by
sordid
dwellings
we
picked
our
way
among
groups
of
dirty
children
and
through
lines
of
discoloured
linen
until
we
came
to
number
46
the
door
of
which
was
decorated
with
small
slip
of
brass
on
which
the
name
rance
was
engraved
on
enquiry
we
found
that
the
constable
was
in
bed
and
we
were
shown
into
little
front
parlour
to
await
his
coming

he
appeared
presently
looking
little
irritable
at
being
disturbed
in
his
slumbers
made
my
report
at
the
office
he
said
holmes
took
half
sovereign
from
his
pocket
and
played
with
it
pensively
we
thought
that
we
should
like
to
hear
it
all
from
your
own
lips
he
said
shall
be
most
happy
to
tell
you
anything
can
the
constable
answered
with
his
eyes
upon
the
little
golden
disk
just
let
us
hear
it
all
in
your
own
way
as
it
occurred
rance
sat
down
on
the
horsehair
sofa
and
knitted
his
brows
as
though
determined
not
to
omit
anything
in
his
narrative
ll
tell
it
ye
from
the
beginning
he
said
my
time
is
from
ten
at
night
to
six
in
the
morning
at
eleven
there
was
fight
at
the
white
hart
but
bar
that
all
was
quiet
enough
on
the
beat
at
one
clock
it
began
to
rain
and
met
harry
murcher
him
who
has
the
holland
grove
beat
and
we
stood
together
at
the
corner
of
henrietta
street
talkin
presently
maybe
about
two
or
little
after
thought
would
take
look
round
and
see
that
all
was
right
down
the
brixton
road
it
was
precious
dirty
and
lonely
not
soul
did
meet
all
the
way
down
though
cab
or
two
went
past
me
was
strollin
down
thinkin
between
ourselves
how
uncommon
handy
four
of
gin
hot
would
be
when
suddenly
the
glint
of
light
caught
my
eye
in
the
window
of
that
same
house
now
knew
that
them
two
houses
in
lauriston
gardens
was
empty
on
account
of
him
that
owns
them
who
won
have
the
drains
seed
to
though
the
very
last
tenant
what
lived
in
one
of
them
died
typhoid
fever
was
knocked
all
in
heap
therefore
at
seeing
light
in
the
window
and
suspected
as
something
was
wrong
when
got
to
the
door
you
stopped
and
then
walked
back
to
the
garden
gate
my
companion
interrupted
what
did
you
do
that
for
rance
gave
violent
jump
and
stared
at
sherlock
holmes
with
the
utmost
amazement
upon
his
features
why
that
true
sir
he
said
though
how
you
come
to
know
it
heaven
only
knows
ye
see
when
got
up
to
the
door
it
was
so
still
and
so
lonesome
that
thought
be
none
the
worse
for
some
one
with
me
ain
afeared
of
anything
on
this
side
the
grave
but
thought
that
maybe
it
was
him
that
died
the
typhoid
inspecting
the
drains
what
killed
him
the
thought
gave
me
kind
turn
and
walked
back
to
the
gate
to
see
if
could
see
murcher
lantern
but
there
wasn
no
sign
of
him
nor
of
anyone
else
there
was
no
one
in
the
street
not
livin
soul
sir
nor
as
much
as
dog
then
pulled
myself
together
and
went
back
and
pushed
the
door
open
all
was
quiet
inside
so
went
into
the
room
where
the
light
was
burnin
there
was
candle
flickerin
on
the
mantelpiece
red
wax
one
and
by
its
light
saw
yes
know
all
that
you
saw
you
walked
round
the
room
several
times
and
you
knelt
down
by
the
body
and
then
you
walked
through
and
tried
the
kitchen
door
and
then
john
rance
sprang
to
his
feet
with
frightened
face
and
suspicion
in
his
eyes
where
was
you
hid
to
see
all
that
he
cried
it
seems
to
me
that
you
knows
deal
more
than
you
should
holmes
laughed
and
threw
his
card
across
the
table
to
the
constable
don
get
arresting
me
for
the
murder
he
said
am
one
of
the
hounds
and
not
the
wolf
mr
gregson
or
mr
lestrade
will
answer
for
that
go
on
though
what
did
you
do
next
rance
resumed
his
seat
without
however
losing
his
mystified
expression
went
back
to
the
gate
and
sounded
my
whistle
that
brought
murcher
and
two
more
to
the
spot
was
the
street
empty
then
well
it
was
as
far
as
anybody
that
could
be
of
any
good
goes
what
do
you
mean
the
constable
features
broadened
into
grin
ve
seen
many
drunk
chap
in
my
time
he
said
but
never
anyone
so
cryin
drunk
as
that
cove
he
was
at
the
gate
when
came
out
leanin
up
agin
the
railings
and
singin
at
the
pitch
his
lungs
about
columbine
new
fangled
banner
or
some
such
stuff
he
couldn
stand
far
less
help
what
sort
of
man
was
he
asked
sherlock
holmes
john
rance
appeared
to
be
somewhat
irritated
at
this
digression
he
was
an
uncommon
drunk
sort
man
he
said
he
ha
found
hisself
in
the
station
if
we
hadn
been
so
took
up
his
face
his
dress
didn
you
notice
them
holmes
broke
in
impatiently
should
think
did
notice
them
seeing
that
had
to
prop
him
up
me
and
murcher
between
us
he
was
long
chap
with
red
face
the
lower
part
muffled
round
that
will
do
cried
holmes
what
became
of
him
we
enough
to
do
without
lookin
after
him
the
policeman
said
in
an
aggrieved
voice
ll
wager
he
found
his
way
home
all
right
how
was
he
dressed
brown
overcoat
had
he
whip
in
his
hand
whip
no
he
must
have
left
it
behind
muttered
my
companion
you
didn
happen
to
see
or
hear
cab
after
that
no
there
half
sovereign
for
you
my
companion
said
standing
up
and
taking
his
hat
am
afraid
rance
that
you
will
never
rise
in
the
force
that
head
of
yours
should
be
for
use
as
well
as
ornament
you
might
have
gained
your
sergeant
stripes
last
night
the
man
whom
you
held
in
your
hands
is
the
man
who
holds
the
clue
of
this
mystery
and
whom
we
are
seeking
there
is
no
use
of
arguing
about
it
now
tell
you
that
it
is
so
come
along
doctor
we
started
off
for
the
cab
together
leaving
our
informant
incredulous
but
obviously
uncomfortable
the
blundering
fool
holmes
said
bitterly
as
we
drove
back
to
our
lodgings
just
to
think
of
his
having
such
an
incomparable
bit
of
good
luck
and
not
taking
advantage
of
it
am
rather
in
the
dark
still
it
is
true
that
the
description
of
this
man
tallies
with
your
idea
of
the
second
party
in
this
mystery
but
why
should
he
come
back
to
the
house
after
leaving
it
that
is
not
the
way
of
criminals
the
ring
man
the
ring
that
was
what
he
came
back
for
if
we
have
no
other
way
of
catching
him
we
can
always
bait
our
line
with
the
ring
shall
have
him
doctor
ll
lay
you
two
to
one
that
have
him
must
thank
you
for
it
all
might
not
have
gone
but
for
you
and
so
have
missed
the
finest
study
ever
came
across
study
in
scarlet
eh
why
shouldn
we
use
little
art
jargon
there
the
scarlet
thread
of
murder
running
through
the
colourless
skein
of
life
and
our
duty
is
to
unravel
it
and
isolate
it
and
expose
every
inch
of
it
and
now
for
lunch
and
then
for
norman
neruda
her
attack
and
her
bowing
are
splendid
what
that
little
thing
of
chopin
she
plays
so
magnificently
tra
la
lira
lay
leaning
back
in
the
cab
this
amateur
bloodhound
carolled
away
like
lark
while
meditated
upon
the
many
sidedness
of
the
human
mind
our
advertisement
brings
visitor
our
morning
exertions
had
been
too
much
for
my
weak
health
and
was
tired
out
in
the
afternoon
after
holmes
departure
for
the
concert
lay
down
upon
the
sofa
and
endeavoured
to
get
couple
of
hours
sleep
it
was
useless
attempt
my
mind
had
been
too
much
excited
by
all
that
had
occurred
and
the
strangest
fancies
and
surmises
crowded
into
it
every
time
that
closed
my
eyes
saw
before
me
the
distorted
baboon
like
countenance
of
the
murdered
man
so
sinister
was
the
impression
which
that
face
had
produced
upon
me
that
found
it
difficult
to
feel
anything
but
gratitude
for
him
who
had
removed
its
owner
from
the
world
if
ever
human
features
bespoke
vice
of
the
most
malignant
type
they
were
certainly
those
of
enoch
drebber
of
cleveland
still
recognized
that
justice
must
be
done
and
that
the
depravity
of
the
victim
was
no
condonement
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
the
more
thought
of
it
the
more
extraordinary
did
my
companion
hypothesis
that
the
man
had
been
poisoned
appear
remembered
how
he
had
sniffed
his
lips
and
had
no
doubt
that
he
had
detected
something
which
had
given
rise
to
the
idea
then
again
if
not
poison
what
had
caused
the
man
death
since
there
was
neither
wound
nor
marks
of
strangulation
but
on
the
other
hand
whose
blood
was
that
which
lay
so
thickly
upon
the
floor
there
were
no
signs
of
struggle
nor
had
the
victim
any
weapon
with
which
he
might
have
wounded
an
antagonist
as
long
as
all
these
questions
were
unsolved
felt
that
sleep
would
be
no
easy
matter
either
for
holmes
or
myself
his
quiet
self
confident
manner
convinced
me
that
he
had
already
formed
theory
which
explained
all
the
facts
though
what
it
was
could
not
for
an
instant
conjecture
he
was
very
late
in
returning
so
late
that
knew
that
the
concert
could
not
have
detained
him
all
the
time
dinner
was
on
the
table
before
he
appeared
it
was
magnificent
he
said
as
he
took
his
seat
do
you
remember
what
darwin
says
about
music
he
claims
that
the
power
of
producing
and
appreciating
it
existed
among
the
human
race
long
before
the
power
of
speech
was
arrived
at
perhaps
that
is
why
we
are
so
subtly
influenced
by
it
there
are
vague
memories
in
our
souls
of
those
misty
centuries
when
the
world
was
in
its
childhood

that
rather
broad
idea
remarked
one
ideas
must
be
as
broad
as
nature
if
they
are
to
interpret
nature
he
answered
what
the
matter
you
re
not
looking
quite
yourself
this
brixton
road
affair
has
upset
you
to
tell
the
truth
it
has
said
ought
to
be
more
case
hardened
after
my
afghan
experiences
saw
my
own
comrades
hacked
to
pieces
at
maiwand
without
losing
my
nerve
can
understand
there
is
mystery
about
this
which
stimulates
the
imagination
where
there
is
no
imagination
there
is
no
horror
have
you
seen
the
evening
paper
no
it
gives
fairly
good
account
of
the
affair
it
does
not
mention
the
fact
that
when
the
man
was
raised
up
woman
wedding
ring
fell
upon
the
floor
it
is
just
as
well
it
does
not
why
look
at
this
advertisement
he
answered
had
one
sent
to
every
paper
this
morning
immediately
after
the
affair
he
threw
the
paper
across
to
me
and
glanced
at
the
place
indicated
it
was
the
first
announcement
in
the
found
column
in
brixton
road
this
morning
it
ran
plain
gold
wedding
ring
found
in
the
roadway
between
the
white
hart
tavern
and
holland
grove
apply
dr
watson
221B
baker
street
between
eight
and
nine
this
evening
excuse
my
using
your
name
he
said
if
used
my
own
some
of
these
dunderheads
would
recognize
it
and
want
to
meddle
in
the
affair
that
is
all
right
answered
but
supposing
anyone
applies
have
no
ring
oh
yes
you
have
said
he
handing
me
one
this
will
do
very
well
it
is
almost
facsimile
and
who
do
you
expect
will
answer
this
advertisement
why
the
man
in
the
brown
coat
our
florid
friend
with
the
square
toes
if
he
does
not
come
himself
he
will
send
an
accomplice
would
he
not
consider
it
as
too
dangerous
not
at
all
if
my
view
of
the
case
is
correct
and
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
it
is
this
man
would
rather
risk
anything
than
lose
the
ring
according
to
my
notion
he
dropped
it
while
stooping
over
drebber
body
and
did
not
miss
it
at
the
time
after
leaving
the
house
he
discovered
his
loss
and
hurried
back
but
found
the
police
already
in
possession
owing
to
his
own
folly
in
leaving
the
candle
burning
he
had
to
pretend
to
be
drunk
in
order
to
allay
the
suspicions
which
might
have
been
aroused
by
his
appearance
at
the
gate
now
put
yourself
in
that
man
place
on
thinking
the
matter
over
it
must
have
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
possible
that
he
had
lost
the
ring
in
the
road
after
leaving
the
house
what
would
he
do
then
he
would
eagerly
look
out
for
the
evening
papers
in
the
hope
of
seeing
it
among
the
articles
found
his
eye
of
course
would
light
upon
this
he
would
be
overjoyed
why
should
he
fear
trap
there
would
be
no
reason
in
his
eyes
why
the
finding
of
the
ring
should
be
connected
with
the
murder
he
would
come
he
will
come
you
shall
see
him
within
an
hour
and
then
asked
oh
you
can
leave
me
to
deal
with
him
then
have
you
any
arms
have
my
old
service
revolver
and
few
cartridges
you
had
better
clean
it
and
load
it
he
will
be
desperate
man
and
though
shall
take
him
unawares
it
is
as
well
to
be
ready
for
anything
went
to
my
bedroom
and
followed
his
advice
when
returned
with
the
pistol
the
table
had
been
cleared
and
holmes
was
engaged
in
his
favourite
occupation
of
scraping
upon
his
violin
the
plot
thickens
he
said
as
entered
have
just
had
an
answer
to
my
american
telegram
my
view
of
the
case
is
the
correct
one
and
that
is—
asked
eagerly
my
fiddle
would
be
the
better
for
new
strings
he
remarked
put
your
pistol
in
your
pocket
when
the
fellow
comes
speak
to
him
in
an
ordinary
way
leave
the
rest
to
me
don
frighten
him
by
looking
at
him
too
hard
it
is
eight
clock
now
said
glancing
at
my
watch
yes
he
will
probably
be
here
in
few
minutes
open
the
door
slightly
that
will
do
now
put
the
key
on
the
inside
thank
you
this
is
queer
old
book

yesterday

charles

here
comes
our
man
think
as
he
spoke
there
was
sharp
ring
at
the
bell
sherlock
holmes
rose
softly
and
moved
his
chair
in
the
direction
of
the
door
we
heard
the
servant
pass
along
the
hall
and
the
sharp
click
of
the
latch
as
she
opened
it
does
dr
watson
live
here
asked
clear
but
rather
harsh
voice
we
could
not
hear
the
servant
reply
but
the
door
closed
and
some
one
began
to
ascend
the
stairs
the
footfall
was
an
uncertain
and
shuffling
one
look
of
surprise
passed
over
the
face
of
my
companion
as
he
listened
to
it
came
slowly
along
the
passage
and
there
was
feeble
tap
at
the

in
cried
at
my
summons
instead
of
the
man
of
violence
whom
we
expected
very
old
and
wrinkled
woman
hobbled
into
the
apartment
she
appeared
to
be
dazzled
by
the
sudden
blaze
of
light
and
after
dropping
curtsey
she
stood
blinking
at
us
with
her
bleared
eyes
and
fumbling
in
her
pocket
with
nervous
shaky
fingers
glanced
at
my
companion
and
his
face
had
assumed
such
disconsolate
expression
that
it
was
all
could
do
to
keep
my
countenance
the
old
crone
drew
out
an
evening
paper
and
pointed
at
our
advertisement
it
this
as
has
brought
me
good
gentlemen
she
said
dropping
another
curtsey
gold
wedding
ring
in
the
brixton
road
it
belongs
to
my
girl
sally
as
was
married
only
this
time
twelvemonth
which
her
husband
is
steward
aboard
union
boat
and
what
he
say
if
he
come
ome
and
found
her
without
her
ring
is
more
than
can
think
he
being
short
enough
at
the
best
times
but
more
especially
when
he
has
the
drink
if
it
please
you
she
went
to
the
circus
last
night
along
with
is
that
her
ring
asked
the
lord
be
thanked
cried
the
old
woman
sally
will
be
glad
woman
this
night
that
the
ring

what
may
your

be
inquired

weary
way
from
here
the
brixton
road
does
not
lie
between
any
circus
and
houndsditch
said
sherlock
holmes
sharply
the
old
woman
faced
round
and
looked
keenly
at
him
from
her
little
red
rimmed
eyes
the
gentleman
asked
me
for
my
address
she
said
sally
lives
in
lodgings
at
mayfield
place
peckham
and
your
name
is
my
name
is
sawyer
hers
is
dennis
which
tom
dennis
married
her
and
smart
clean
lad
too
as
long
as
he
at
sea
and
no
steward
in
the
company
more
thought
of
but
when
on
shore
what
with
the
women
and
what
with
liquor
shops
here
is
your
ring
mrs
sawyer
interrupted
in
obedience
to
sign
from
my
companion
it
clearly
belongs
to
your
daughter
and
am
glad
to
be
able
to
restore
it
to
the
rightful
owner
with
many
mumbled
blessings
and
protestations
of
gratitude
the
old
crone
packed
it
away
in
her
pocket
and
shuffled
off
down
the
stairs
sherlock
holmes
sprang
to
his
feet
the
moment
that
she
was
gone
and
rushed
into
his
room
he
returned
in
few
seconds
enveloped
in
an
ulster
and
cravat
ll
follow
her
he
said
hurriedly
she
must
be
an
accomplice
and
will
lead
me
to
him
wait
up
for
me
the
hall
door
had
hardly
slammed
behind
our
visitor
before
holmes
had
descended
the
stair
looking
through
the
window
could
see
her
walking
feebly
along
the
other
side
while
her
pursuer
dogged
her
some
little
distance
behind
either
his
whole
theory
is
incorrect
thought
to
myself
or
else
he
will
be
led
now
to
the
heart
of
the
mystery
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
ask
me
to
wait
up
for
him
for
felt
that
sleep
was
impossible
until
heard
the
result
of
his
adventure
it
was
close
upon
nine
when
he
set
out
had
no
idea
how
long
he
might
be
but
sat
stolidly
puffing
at
my
pipe
and
skipping
over
the
pages
of
henri
murger
vie
de
bohème
ten
clock
passed
and
heard
the
footsteps
of
the
maid
as
they
pattered
off
to
bed
eleven
and
the
more
stately
tread
of
the
landlady
passed
my
door
bound
for
the
same
destination
it
was
close
upon
twelve
before
heard
the
sharp
sound
of
his
latch
key
the
instant
he
entered
saw
by
his
face
that
he
had
not
been
successful
amusement
and
chagrin
seemed
to
be
struggling
for
the
mastery
until
the
former
suddenly
carried
the
day
and
he
burst
into
hearty
laugh
wouldn
have
the
scotland
yarders
know
it
for
the
world
he
cried
dropping
into
his
chair
have
chaffed
them
so
much
that
they
would
never
have
let
me
hear
the
end
of
it
can
afford
to
laugh
because
know
that
will
be
even
with
them

the

what
is
it
then
asked
oh
don
mind
telling
story
against
myself
that
creature
had
gone
little
way
when
she
began
to
limp
and
show
every
sign
of
being
foot
sore
presently
she
came
to
halt
and
hailed
four
wheeler
which
was
passing
managed
to
be
close
to
her
so
as
to
hear
the
address
but
need
not
have
been
so
anxious
for
she
sang
it
out
loud
enough
to
be
heard
at
the
other
side
of
the
street
drive
to
13
duncan
street
houndsditch
she
cried
this
begins
to
look
genuine
thought
and
having
seen
her
safely
inside
perched
myself
behind
that
an
art
which
every
detective
should
be
an
expert
at
well
away
we
rattled
and
never
drew
rein
until
we
reached
the
street
in
question
hopped
off
before
we
came
to
the
door
and
strolled
down
the
street
in
an
easy
lounging
way
saw
the
cab
pull
up
the
driver
jumped
down
and
saw
him
open
the
door
and
stand
expectantly
nothing
came
out
though
when
reached
him
he
was
groping
about
frantically
in
the
empty
cab
and
giving
vent
to
the
finest
assorted
collection
of
oaths
that
ever
listened
to
there
was
no
sign
or
trace
of
his
passenger
and
fear
it
will
be
some
time
before
he
gets
his
fare
on
inquiring
at
number
13
we
found
that
the
house
belonged
to
respectable
paperhanger
named
keswick
and
that
no
one
of
the
name
either
of
sawyer
or
dennis
had
ever
been
heard
of
there
you
don
mean
to
say
cried
in
amazement
that
tottering
feeble
old
woman
was
able
to
get
out
of
the
cab
while
it
was
in
motion
without
either
you
or
the
driver
seeing
her
old
woman
be
damned
said
sherlock
holmes
sharply
we
were
the
old
women
to
be
so
taken
in
it
must
have
been
young
man
and
an
active
one
too
besides
being
an
incomparable
actor
the
get
up
was
inimitable
he
saw
that
he
was
followed
no
doubt
and
used
this
means
of
giving
me
the
slip
it
shows
that
the
man
we
are
after
is
not
as
lonely
as
imagined
he
was
but
has
friends
who
are
ready
to
risk
something
for
him
now
doctor
you
are
looking
done
up
take
my
advice
and
turn
in
was
certainly
feeling
very
weary
so
obeyed
his
injunction
left
holmes
seated
in
front
of
the
smouldering
fire
and
long
into
the
watches
of
the
night
heard
the
low
melancholy
wailings
of
his
violin
and
knew
that
he
was
still
pondering
over
the
strange
problem
which
he
had
set
himself
to
unravel
vi
tobias
gregson
shows
what
he
can
do
the
papers
next
day
were
full
of
the
brixton
mystery
as
they
termed
it
each
had
long
account
of
the
affair
and
some
had
leaders
upon
it
in
addition
there
was
some
information
in
them
which
was
new
to
me
still
retain
in
my
scrap
book
numerous
clippings
and
extracts
bearing
upon
the
case
here
is
condensation
of
few
of
them
the
daily
telegraph
remarked
that
in
the
history
of
crime
there
had
seldom
been
tragedy
which
presented
stranger
features
the
german
name
of
the
victim
the
absence
of
all
other
motive
and
the
sinister
inscription
on
the
wall
all
pointed
to
its
perpetration
by
political
refugees
and
revolutionists
the
socialists
had
many
branches
in
america
and
the
deceased
had
no
doubt
infringed
their
unwritten
laws
and
been
tracked
down
by
them
after
alluding
airily
to
the
vehmgericht
aqua
tofana
carbonari
the
marchioness
de
brinvilliers
the
darwinian
theory
the
principles
of
malthus
and
the
ratcliff
highway
murders
the
article
concluded
by
admonishing
the
government
and
advocating
closer
watch
over
foreigners
in
england
the
standard
commented
upon
the
fact
that
lawless
outrages
of
the
sort
usually
occurred
under
liberal
administration
they
arose
from
the
unsettling
of
the
minds
of
the
masses
and
the
consequent
weakening
of
all
authority
the
deceased
was
an
american
gentleman
who
had
been
residing
for
some
weeks
in
the
metropolis
he
had
stayed
at
the
boarding
house
of
madame
charpentier
in
torquay
terrace
camberwell
he
was
accompanied
in
his
travels
by
his
private
secretary
mr
joseph
stangerson
the
two
bade
adieu
to
their
landlady
upon
tuesday
the
4th
inst
and
departed
to
euston
station
with
the
avowed
intention
of
catching
the
liverpool
express
they
were
afterwards
seen
together
upon
the
platform
nothing
more
is
known
of
them
until
mr
drebber
body
was
as
recorded
discovered
in
an
empty
house
in
the
brixton
road
many
miles
from
euston
how
he
came
there
or
how
he
met
his
fate
are
questions
which
are
still
involved
in
mystery
nothing
is
known
of
the
whereabouts
of
stangerson
we
are
glad
to
learn
that
mr
lestrade
and
mr
gregson
of
scotland
yard
are
both
engaged
upon
the
case
and
it
is
confidently
anticipated
that
these
well
known
officers
will
speedily
throw
light
upon
the
matter
the
daily
news
observed
that
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
crime
being
political
one
the
despotism
and
hatred
of
liberalism
which
animated
the
continental
governments
had
the
effect
of
driving
to
our
shores
number
of
men
who
might
have
made
excellent
citizens
were
they
not
soured
by
the
recollection
of
all
that
they
had
undergone
among
these
men
there
was
stringent
code
of
honour
any
infringement
of
which
was
punished
by
death
every
effort
should
be
made
to
find
the
secretary
stangerson
and
to
ascertain
some
particulars
of
the
habits
of
the
deceased
great
step
had
been
gained
by
the
discovery
of
the
address
of
the
house
at
which
he
had
boarded
result
which
was
entirely
due
to
the
acuteness
and
energy
of
mr
gregson
of
scotland
yard
sherlock
holmes
and
read
these
notices
over
together
at
breakfast
and
they
appeared
to
afford
him
considerable
amusement
told
you
that
whatever
happened
lestrade
and
gregson
would
be
sure
to
score
that
depends
on
how
it
turns
out
oh
bless
you
it
doesn
matter
in
the
least
if
the
man
is
caught
it
will
be
on
account
of
their
exertions
if
he
escapes
it
will
be
in
spite
of
their
exertions
it
heads
win
and
tails
you
lose
whatever
they
do
they
will
have
followers
un

what

this
cried
for
at
this
moment
there
came
the
pattering
of
many
steps
in
the
hall
and
on
the
stairs
accompanied
by
audible
expressions
of
disgust
upon
the
part
of
our
landlady
it
the
baker
street
division
of
the
detective
police
force
said
my
companion
gravely
and
as
he
spoke
there
rushed
into
the
room
half
dozen
of
the
dirtiest
and
most
ragged
street
arabs
that
ever
clapped
eyes
on
tention
cried
holmes
in
sharp
tone
and
the
six
dirty
little
scoundrels
stood
in
line
like
so
many
disreputable
statuettes
in
future
you
shall
send
up
wiggins
alone
to
report
and
the
rest
of
you
must
wait
in
the
street
have
you
found
it
wiggins
no
sir
we
hain
said
one
of
the
youths
hardly
expected
you
would
you
must
keep
on
until
you
do
here
are
your
wages
he
handed
each
of
them
shilling
now
off
you
go
and
come
back
with
better
report
next
time
he
waved
his
hand
and
they
scampered
away
downstairs
like
so
many
rats
and
we
heard
their
shrill
voices
next
moment
in
the
street
there
more
work
to
be
got
out
of
one
of
those
little
beggars
than
out
of
dozen
of
the
force
holmes
remarked
the
mere
sight
of
an
official
looking
person
seals
men
lips
these
youngsters
however
go
everywhere
and
hear
everything
they
are
as
sharp
as
needles
too
all
they
want
is
organisation
is
it
on
this
brixton
case
that
you
are
employing
them
asked
yes
there
is
point
which
wish
to
ascertain
it
is
merely
matter
of
time
hullo
we
are
going
to
hear
some
news
now
with
vengeance
here
is
gregson
coming
down
the
road
with
beatitude
written
upon
every
feature
of
his
face
bound
for
us
know
yes
he
is
stopping
there
he
is
there
was
violent
peal
at
the
bell
and
in
few
seconds
the
fair
haired
detective
came
up
the
stairs
three
steps
at
time
and
burst
into
our
sitting
room
my
dear
fellow
he
cried
wringing
holmes
unresponsive
hand
congratulate
me
have
made
the
whole
thing
as
clear
as
day
shade
of
anxiety
seemed
to
me
to
cross
my
companion
expressive
face
do
you
mean
that
you
are
on
the
right
track
he
asked
the
right
track
why
sir
we
have
the
man
under
lock
and
key
and
his
name
is
arthur
charpentier
sub
lieutenant
in
her
majesty
navy
cried
gregson
pompously
rubbing
his
fat
hands
and
inflating
his
chest
sherlock
holmes
gave
sigh
of
relief
and
relaxed
into
smile
take
seat
and
try
one
of
these
cigars
he
said
we
are
anxious
to
know
how
you
managed
it
will
you
have
some
whiskey
and
water
don
mind
if
do
the
detective
answered
the
tremendous
exertions
which
have
gone
through
during
the
last
day
or
two
have
worn
me
out
not
so
much
bodily
exertion
you
understand
as
the
strain
upon
the
mind
you
will
appreciate
that
mr
sherlock
holmes

you
do
me
too
much
honour
said
holmes
gravely
let
us
hear
how
you
arrived
at
this
most
gratifying
result
the
detective
seated
himself
in
the
arm
chair
and
puffed
complacently
at
his
cigar
then
suddenly
he
slapped
his
thigh
in
paroxysm
of
amusement
the
fun
of
it
is
he
cried
that
fool
lestrade
who
thinks
himself
so
smart
has
gone
off
upon
the
wrong
track
altogether
he
is
after
the
secretary
stangerson
who
had
no
more
to
do
with
the
crime
than
the
babe
unborn
have
no
doubt
that
he
has
caught
him
by
this
time
the
idea
tickled
gregson
so
much
that
he
laughed
until
he
choked
and
how
did
you
get
your
clue
ah
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
of
course
doctor
watson
this
is
strictly
between
ourselves
the
first
difficulty
which
we
had
to
contend
with
was
the
finding
of
this
american
antecedents
some
people
would
have
waited
until
their
advertisements
were
answered
or
until
parties
came
forward
and
volunteered
information
that
is
not
tobias
gregson
way
of
going
to
work
you
remember
the
hat
beside
the
dead
man
yes
said
holmes
by
john
underwood
and
sons
129
camberwell
road
gregson
looked
quite
crest
fallen
had
no
idea
that
you
noticed
that
he
said
have
you
been
there
no
ha
cried
gregson
in
relieved
voice
you
should
never
neglect
chance
however
small
it
may
seem
to
great
mind
nothing
is
little
remarked
holmes
sententiously
well
went
to
underwood
and
asked
him
if
he
had
sold
hat
of
that
size
and
description
he
looked
over
his
books
and
came
on
it
at
once
he
had
sent
the
hat
to
mr
drebber
residing
at
charpentier
boarding
establishment
torquay
terrace
thus
got
at
his
address
smart
very
smart
murmured
sherlock
holmes
next
called
upon
madame
charpentier
continued
the
detective
found
her
very
pale
and
distressed
her
daughter
was
in
the
room
too
an
uncommonly
fine
girl
she
is
too
she
was
looking
red
about
the
eyes
and
her
lips
trembled
as
spoke
to
her
that
didn
escape
my
notice
began
to
smell
rat
you
know
the
feeling
mr
sherlock
holmes
when
you
come
upon
the
right
scent
kind
of
thrill
in
your
nerves
have
you
heard
of
the
mysterious
death
of
your
late
boarder
mr
enoch
drebber
of
cleveland
asked
the
mother
nodded
she
didn
seem
able
to
get
out
word
the
daughter
burst
into
tears
felt
more
than
ever
that
these
people
knew
something
of
the
matter
at
what
clock
did
mr
drebber
leave
your
house
for
the
train
asked
at
eight
clock
she
said
gulping
in
her
throat
to
keep
down
her
agitation
his
secretary
mr
stangerson
said
that
there
were
two
trains
one
at
15
and
one
at
11
he
was
to
catch
the
first
and
was
that
the
last
which
you
saw
of
him
terrible
change
came
over
the
woman
face
as
asked
the
question
her
features
turned
perfectly
livid
it
was
some
seconds
before
she
could
get
out
the
single
word
yes
and
when
it
did
come
it
was
in
husky
unnatural
tone
there
was
silence
for
moment
and
then
the
daughter
spoke
in
calm
clear
voice
no
good
can
ever
come
of
falsehood
mother
she
said
let
us
be
frank
with
this
gentleman
we
did
see
mr
drebber
again
god
forgive
you
cried
madame
charpentier
throwing
up
her
hands
and
sinking
back
in
her
chair
you
have
murdered
your
brother
arthur
would
rather
that
we
spoke
the
truth
the
girl
answered
firmly
you
had
best
tell
me
all
about
it
now
said
half
confidences
are
worse
than
none
besides
you
do
not
know
how
much
we
know
of
it
on
your
head
be
it
alice
cried
her
mother
and
then
turning
to
me
will
tell
you
all
sir
do
not
imagine
that
my
agitation
on
behalf
of
my
son
arises
from
any
fear
lest
he
should
have
had
hand
in
this
terrible
affair
he
is
utterly
innocent
of
it
my
dread
is
however
that
in
your
eyes
and
in
the
eyes
of
others
he
may
appear
to
be
compromised
that
however
is
surely
impossible
his
high
character
his
profession
his
antecedents
would
all
forbid
it
your
best
way
is
to
make
clean
breast
of
the
facts
answered
depend
upon
it
if
your
son
is
innocent
he
will
be
none
the
worse
perhaps
alice
you
had
better
leave
us
together
she
said
and
her
daughter
withdrew
now
sir
she
continued
had
no
intention
of
telling
you
all
this
but
since
my
poor
daughter
has
disclosed
it
have
no
alternative
having
once
decided
to
speak
will
tell
you
all
without
omitting
any
particular
it
is
your
wisest
course
said
mr
drebber
has
been
with
us
nearly
three
weeks
he
and
his
secretary
mr
stangerson
had
been
travelling
on
the
continent
noticed
copenhagen
label
upon
each
of
their
trunks
showing
that
had
been
their
last
stopping
place
stangerson
was
quiet
reserved
man
but
his
employer
am
sorry
to
say
was
far
otherwise
he
was
coarse
in
his
habits
and
brutish
in
his
ways
the
very
night
of
his
arrival
he
became
very
much
the
worse
for
drink
and
indeed
after
twelve
clock
in
the
day
he
could
hardly
ever
be
said
to
be
sober
his
manners
towards
the
maid
servants
were
disgustingly
free
and
familiar
worst
of
all
he
speedily
assumed
the
same
attitude
towards
my
daughter
alice
and
spoke
to
her
more
than
once
in
way
which
fortunately
she
is
too
innocent
to
understand
on
one
occasion
he
actually
seized
her
in
his
arms
and
embraced
her
an
outrage
which
caused
his
own
secretary
to
reproach
him
for
his
unmanly
conduct
but
why
did
you
stand
all
this
asked
suppose
that
you
can
get
rid
of
your
boarders
when
you
wish
mrs
charpentier
blushed
at
my
pertinent
question
would
to
god
that
had
given
him
notice
on
the
very
day
that
he
came
she
said
but
it
was
sore
temptation
they
were
paying
pound
day
each
fourteen
pounds
week
and
this
is
the
slack
season
am
widow
and
my
boy
in
the
navy
has
cost
me
much
grudged
to
lose
the
money
acted
for
the
best
this
last
was
too
much
however
and
gave
him
notice
to
leave
on
account
of
it
that
was
the
reason
of
his
going
well
my
heart
grew
light
when
saw
him
drive
away
my
son
is
on
leave
just
now
but
did
not
tell
him
anything
of
all
this
for
his
temper
is
violent
and
he
is
passionately
fond
of
his
sister
when
closed
the
door
behind
them
load
seemed
to
be
lifted
from
my
mind
alas
in
less
than
an
hour
there
was
ring
at
the
bell
and
learned
that
mr
drebber
had
returned
he
was
much
excited
and
evidently
the
worse
for
drink
he
forced
his
way
into
the
room
where
was
sitting
with
my
daughter
and
made
some
incoherent
remark
about
having
missed
his
train
he
then
turned
to
alice
and
before
my
very
face
proposed
to
her
that
she
should
fly
with
him
you
are
of
age
he
said
and
there
is
no
law
to
stop
you
have
money
enough
and
to
spare
never
mind
the
old
girl
here
but
come
along
with
me
now
straight
away
you
shall
live
like
princess
poor
alice
was
so
frightened
that
she
shrunk
away
from
him
but
he
caught
her
by
the
wrist
and
endeavoured
to
draw
her
towards
the
door
screamed
and
at
that
moment
my
son
arthur
came
into
the
room
what
happened
then
do
not
know
heard
oaths
and
the
confused
sounds
of
scuffle
was
too
terrified
to
raise
my
head
when
did
look
up
saw
arthur
standing
in
the
doorway
laughing
with
stick
in
his
hand
don
think
that
fine
fellow
will
trouble
us
again
he
said
will
just
go
after
him
and
see
what
he
does
with
himself
with
those
words
he
took
his
hat
and
started
off
down
the
street
the
next
morning
we
heard
of
mr
drebber
mysterious
death
this
statement
came
from
mrs
charpentier
lips
with
many
gasps
and
pauses
at
times
she
spoke
so
low
that
could
hardly
catch
the
words
made
shorthand
notes
of
all
that
she
said
however
so
that
there
should
be
no
possibility
of
mistake
it
quite
exciting
said
sherlock
holmes
with
yawn
what
happened
next
when
mrs
charpentier
paused
the
detective
continued
saw
that
the
whole
case
hung
upon
one
point
fixing
her
with
my
eye
in
way
which
always
found
effective
with
women
asked
her
at
what
hour
her
son
returned
do
not
know
she
answered
not
know
no
he
has
latch
key
and
he
let
himself
in
after
you
went
to
bed
yes
when
did
you
go
to
bed
about
eleven
so
your
son
was
gone
at
least
two
hours
yes
possibly
four
or
five
yes
what
was
he
doing
during
that
time
do
not
know
she
answered
turning
white
to
her
very
lips
of
course
after
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
found
out
where
lieutenant
charpentier
was
took
two
officers
with
me
and
arrested
him
when
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
and
warned
him
to
come
quietly
with
us
he
answered
us
as
bold
as
brass
suppose
you
are
arresting
me
for
being
concerned
in
the
death
of
that
scoundrel
drebber
he
said
we
had
said
nothing
to
him
about
it
so
that
his
alluding
to
it
had
most
suspicious
aspect

very
said
holmes
he
still
carried
the
heavy
stick
which
the
mother
described
him
as
having
with
him
when
he
followed
drebber
it
was
stout
oak
cudgel
what
is
your
theory
then
well
my
theory
is
that
he
followed
drebber
as
far
as
the
brixton
road
when
there
fresh
altercation
arose
between
them
in
the
course
of
which
drebber
received
blow
from
the
stick
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
perhaps
which
killed
him
without
leaving
any
mark
the
night
was
so
wet
that
no
one
was
about
so
charpentier
dragged
the
body
of
his
victim
into
the
empty
house
as
to
the
candle
and
the
blood
and
the
writing
on
the
wall
and
the
ring
they
may
all
be
so
many
tricks
to
throw
the
police
on
to
the
wrong
scent
well
done
said
holmes
in
an
encouraging
voice
really
gregson
you
are
getting
along
we
shall
make
something
of
you
yet
flatter
myself
that
have
managed
it
rather
neatly
the
detective
answered
proudly
the
young
man
volunteered
statement
in
which
he
said
that
after
following
drebber
some
time
the
latter
perceived
him
and
took
cab
in
order
to
get
away
from
him
on
his
way
home
he
met
an
old
shipmate
and
took
long
walk
with
him
on
being
asked
where
this
old
shipmate
lived
he
was
unable
to
give
any
satisfactory
reply
think
the
whole
case
fits
together
uncommonly
well
what
amuses
me
is
to
think
of
lestrade
who
had
started
off
upon
the
wrong
scent
am
afraid
he
won
make
much
of
1t
why
by
jove
here
the
very
man
himself
it
was
indeed
lestrade
who
had
ascended
the
stairs
while
we
were
talking
and
who
now
entered
the
room
the
assurance
and
jauntiness
which
generally
marked
his
demeanour
and
dress
were
however
wanting
his
face
was
disturbed
and
troubled
while
his
clothes
were
disarranged
and
untidy
he
had
evidently
come
with
the
intention
of
consulting
with
sherlock
holmes
for
on
perceiving
his
colleague
he
appeared
to
be
embarrassed
and
put
out
he
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room
fumbling
nervously
with
his
hat
and
uncertain
what
to
do
this
is
most
extraordinary
case
he
said
at
last
most
incomprehensible
affair
ah
you
find
it
so
mr
lestrade
cried
gregson
triumphantly
thought
you
would
come
to
that
conclusion
have
you
managed
to
find
the
secretary
mr
joseph
stangerson
the
secretary
mr
joseph
stangerson
said
lestrade
gravely
was
murdered
at
halliday
private
hotel
about
six
clock
this
morning
vii
light
in
the
darkness
the
intelligence
with
which
lestrade
greeted
us
was
so
momentous
and
so
unexpected
that
we
were
all
three
fairly
dumfoundered
gregson
sprang
out
of
his
chair
and
upset
the
remainder
of
his
whiskey
and
water
stared
in
silence
at
sherlock
holmes
whose
lips
were
compressed
and
his
brows
drawn
down
over
his
eyes
stangerson
too
he
muttered
the
plot
thickens
it
was
quite
thick
enough
before
grumbled
lestrade
taking
chair
seem
to
have
dropped
into
sort
of
council
of
war
are
you
are
you
sure
of
this
piece
of
intelligence
stammered
gregson
have
just
come
from
his
room
said
lestrade
was
the
first
to
discover
what
had
occurred
we
have
been
hearing
gregson
view
of
the
matter
holmes
observed
would
you
mind
letting
us
know
what
you
have
seen
and
done
have
no
objection
lestrade
answered
seating
himself
freely
confess
that
was
of
the
opinion
that
stangerson
was
concerned
in
the
death
of
drebber
this
fresh
development
has
shown
me
that
was
completely
mistaken
full
of
the
one
idea
set
myself
to
find
out
what
had
become
of
the
secretary
they
had
been
seen
together
at
euston
station
about
half
past
eight
on
the
evening
of
the
third
at
two
in
the
morning
drebber
had
been
found
in
the
brixton
road
the
question
which
confronted
me
was
to
find
out
how
stangerson
had
been
employed
between
30
and
the
time
of
the
crime
and
what
had
become
of
him
afterwards
telegraphed
to
liverpool
giving
description
of
the
man
and
warning
them
to
keep
watch
upon
the
american
boats
then
set
to
work
calling
upon
all
the
hotels
and
lodging
houses
in
the
vicinity
of
euston
you
see
argued
that
if
drebber
and
his
companion
had
become
separated
the
natural
course
for
the
latter
would
be
to
put
up
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
for
the
night
and
then
to
hang
about
the
station
again
next
morning
they
would
be
likely
to
agree
on
some
meeting
place
beforehand
remarked
holmes
so
it
proved
spent
the
whole
of
yesterday
evening
in
making
enquiries
entirely
without
avail
this
morning
began
very
early
and
at
eight
clock
reached
halliday
private
hotel
in
little
george
street
on
my
enquiry
as
to
whether
mr
stangerson
was
living
there
they
at
once
answered
me
in
the
affirmative
no
doubt
you
are
the
gentleman
whom
he
was
expecting
they
said
he
has
been
waiting
for
gentleman
for
two
days
where
is
he
now
asked
he
is
upstairs
in
bed
he
wished
to
be
called
at
nine
will
go
up
and
see
him
at
once
said
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
sudden
appearance
might
shake
his
nerves
and
lead
him
to
say
something
unguarded
the
boots
volunteered
to
show
me
the
room
it
was
on
the
second
floor
and
there
was
small
corridor
leading
up
to
it
the
boots
pointed
out
the
door
to
me
and
was
about
to
go
downstairs
again
when
saw
something
that
made
me
feel
sickish
in
spite
of
my
twenty
years
experience
from
under
the
door
there
curled
little
red
ribbon
of
blood
which
had
meandered
across
the
passage
and
formed
little
pool
along
the
skirting
at
the
other
side
gave
cry
which
brought
the
boots
back
he
nearly
fainted
when
he
saw
it
the
door
was
locked
on
the
inside
but
we
put
our
shoulders
to
it
and
knocked
it
in
the
window
of
the
room
was
open
and
beside
the
window
all
huddled
up
lay
the
body
of
man
in
his
nightdress
he
was
quite
dead
and
had
been
for
some
time
for
his
limbs
were
rigid
and
cold
when
we
turned
him
over
the
boots
recognized
him
at
once
as
being
the
same
gentleman
who
had
engaged
the
room
under
the
name
of
joseph
stangerson
the
cause
of
death
was
deep
stab
in
the
left
side
which
must
have
penetrated
the
heart
and
now
comes
the
strangest
part
of
the
affair
what
do
you
suppose
was
above
the
murdered
man
felt
creeping
of
the
flesh
and
presentiment
of
coming
horror
even
before
sherlock
holmes
answered
the
word
rache
written
in
letters
of
blood
he
said
that
was
it
said
lestrade
in
an
awe
struck
voice
and
we
were
all
silent
for
while
there
was
something
so
methodical
and
so
incomprehensible
about
the
deeds
of
this
unknown
assassin
that
it
imparted
fresh
ghastliness
to
his
crimes
my
nerves
which
were
steady
enough
on
the
field
of
battle
tingled
as
thought
of
it
the
man
was
seen
continued
lestrade
milk
boy
passing
on
his
way
to
the
dairy
happened
to
walk
down
the
lane
which
leads
from
the
mews
at
the
back
of
the
hotel
he
noticed
that
ladder
which
usually
lay
there
was
raised
against
one
of
the
windows
of
the
second
floor
which
was
wide
open
after
passing
he
looked
back
and
saw
man
descend
the
ladder
he
came
down
so
quietly
and
openly
that
the
boy
imagined
him
to
be
some
carpenter
or
joiner
at
work
in
the
hotel
he
took
no
particular
notice
of
him
beyond
thinking
in
his
own
mind
that
it
was
early
for
him
to
be
at
work
he
has
an
impression
that
the
man
was
tall
had
reddish
face
and
was
dressed
in
long
brownish
coat
he
must
have
stayed
in
the
room
some
little
time
after
the
murder
for
we
found
blood
stained
water
in
the
basin
where
he
had
washed
his
hands
and
marks
on
the
sheets
where
he
had
deliberately
wiped
his
knife
glanced
at
holmes
on
hearing
the
description
of
the
murderer
which
tallied
so
exactly
with
his
own
there
was
however
no
trace
of
exultation
or
satisfaction
upon
his
face
did
you
find
nothing
in
the
room
which
could
furnish
clue
to
the
murderer
he
asked
nothing
stangerson
had
drebber
purse
in
his
pocket
but
it
seems
that
this
was
usual
as
he
did
all
the
paying
there
was
eighty
odd
pounds
in
it
but
nothing
had
been
taken
whatever
the
motives
of
these
extraordinary
crimes
robbery
is
certainly
not
one
of
them
there
were
no
papers
or
memoranda
in
the
murdered
man
pocket
except
single
telegram
dated
from
cleveland
about
month
ago
and
containing
the
words
is
in
europe
there
was
no
name
appended
to
this
message
and
there
was
nothing
else
holmes
asked
nothing
of
any
importance
the
man
novel
with
which
he
had
read
himself
to
sleep
was
lying
upon
the
bed
and
his
pipe
was
on
chair
beside
him
there
was
glass
of
water
on
the
table
and
on
the
window
sill
small
chip
ointment
box
containing
couple
of
pills
sherlock
holmes
sprang
from
his
chair
with
an
exclamation
of
delight
the
last
link
he
cried
exultantly
my
case
is
complete
the
two
detectives
stared
at
him
in
amazement

my
hands
my
companion
said
confidently
all
the
threads
which
have
formed
such
tangle
there
are
of
course
details
to
be
filled
in
but
am
as
certain
of
all
the
main
facts
from
the
time
that
drebber
parted
from
stangerson
at
the
station
up
to
the
discovery
of
the
body
of
the
latter
as
if
had
seen
them
with
my
own
eyes
will
give
you
proof
of
my
knowledge
could
you
lay
your
hand
upon
those
pills
have
them
said
lestrade
producing
small
white
box
took
them
and
the
purse
and
the
telegram
intending
to
have
them
put
in
place
of
safety
at
the
police
station
it
was
the
merest
chance
my
taking
these
pills
for
am
bound
to
say
that
do
not
attach
any
importance
to
them
give
them
here
said
holmes
now
doctor
turning
to
me
are
those
ordinary
pills
they
certainly
were
not
they
were
of
pearly
grey
colour
small
round
and
almost
transparent
against
the
light
from
their
lightness
and
transparency
should
imagine
that
they
are
soluble
in
water
remarked
precisely
so
answered
holmes
now
would
you
mind
going
down
and
fetching
that
poor
little
devil
of
terrier
which
has
been
bad
so
long
and
which
the
landlady
wanted
you
to
put
out
of
its
pain
yesterday
went
downstairs
and
carried
the
dog
upstair
in
my
arms
its
laboured
breathing
and
glazing
eye
showed
that
it
was
not
far
from
its
end
indeed
its
snow
white
muzzle
proclaimed
that
it
had
already
exceeded
the
usual
term
of
canine
existence
placed
it
upon
cushion
on
the
rug
will
now
cut
one
of
these
pills
in
two
said
holmes
and
drawing
his
penknife
he
suited
the
action
to
the
word
one
half
we
return
into
the
box
for
future
purposes
the
other
half
will
place
in
this
wine
glass
in
which
is
teaspoonful
of
water
you
perceive
that
our
friend
the
doctor
is
right
and
that
it
readily
dissolves
this
may
be
very
interesting
said
lestrade
in
the
injured
tone
of
one
who
suspects
that
he
is
being
laughed
at
cannot
see
however
what
it
has
to
do
with
the
death
of
mr
joseph
stangerson
patience
my
friend
patience
you
will
find
in
time
that
it
has
everything
to
do
with
it
shall
now
add
little
milk
to
make
the
mixture
palatable
and
on
presenting
it
to
the
dog
we
find
that
he
laps
it
up
readily
enough
as
he
spoke
he
turned
the
contents
of
the
wine
glass
into
saucer
and
placed
it
in
front
of
the
terrier
who
speedily
licked
it
dry
sherlock
holmes
earnest
demeanour
had
so
far
convinced
us
that
we
all
sat
in
silence
watching
the
animal
intently
and
expecting
some
startling
effect
none
such
appeared
however
the
dog
continued
to
lie
stretched
upon
the
cushion
breathing
in
laboured
way
but
apparently
neither
the
better
nor
the
worse
for
its
draught
holmes
had
taken
out
his
watch
and
as
minute
followed
minute
without
result
an
expression
of
the
utmost
chagrin
and
disappointment
appeared
upon
his
features
he
gnawed
his
lip
drummed
his
fingers
upon
the
table
and
showed
every
other
symptom
of
acute
impatience
so
great
was
his
emotion
that
felt
sincerely
sorry
for
him
while
the
two
detectives
smiled
derisively
by
no
means
displeased
at
this
check
which
he
had
met
it
can
be
coincidence
he
cried
at
last
springing
from
his
chair
and
pacing
wildly
up
and
down
the
room
it
is
impossible
that
it
should
be
mere
coincidence
the
very
pills
which
suspected
in
the
case
of
drebber
are
actually
found
after
the
death
of
stangerson
and
yet
they
are
inert
what
can
it
mean
surely
my
whole
chain
of
reasoning
cannot
have
been
false
it
is
impossible
and
yet
this
wretched
dog
is
none
the
worse
ah
have
it
have
it
with
perfect
shriek
of
delight
he
rushed
to
the
box
cut
the
other
pill
in
two
dissolved
it
added
milk
and
presented
it
to
the
terrier
the
unfortunate
creature
tongue
seemed
hardly
to
have
been
moistened
in
it
before
it
gave
convulsive
shiver
in
every
limb
and
lay
as
rigid
and
lifeless
as
if
it
had
been
struck
by
lightning
sherlock
holmes
drew
long
breath
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
should
have
more
faith
he
said
ought
to
know
by
this
time
that
when
fact
appears
to
be
opposed
to
long
train
of
deductions
it
invariably
proves
to
be
capable
of
bearing
some
other
interpretation
of
the
two
pills
in
that
box
one
was
of
the
most
deadly
poison
and
the
other
was
entirely
harmless
ought
to
have
known
that
before
ever
saw
the
box
at
all
this
last
statement
appeared
to
me
to
be
so
startling
that
could
hardly
believe
that
he
was
in
his
sober
senses
there
was
the
dead
dog
however
to
prove
that
his
conjecture
had
been
correct
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
mists
in
my
own
mind
were
gradually
clearing
away
and
began
to
have
dim
vague
perception
of
the
truth
all
this
seems
strange
to
you
continued
holmes
because
you
failed
at
the
beginning
of
the
inquiry
to
grasp
the
importance
of
the
single
real
clue
which
was
presented
to
you
had
the
good
fortune
to
seize
upon
that
and
everything
which
has
occurred
since
then
has
served
to
confirm
my
original
supposition
and
indeed
was
the
logical
sequence
of
it
hence
things
which
have
perplexed
you
and
made
the
case
more
obscure
have
served
to
enlighten
me
and
to
strengthen
my
conclusions
it
is
mistake
to
confound
strangeness
with
mystery
the
most
commonplace
crime
is
often
the
most
mysterious
because
it
presents
no
new
or
special
features
from
which
deductions
may
be
drawn
this
murder
would
have
been
infinitely
more
difficult
to
unravel
had
the
body
of
the
victim
been
simply
found
lying
in
the
roadway
without
any
of
those
outré
and
sensational
accompaniments
which
have
rendered
it
remarkable
these
strange
details
far
from
making
the
case
more
difficult
have
really
had
the
effect
of
making
it
less
so
mr
gregson
who
had
listened
to
this
address
with
considerable
impatience
could
contain
himself
no
longer
look
here
mr
sherlock
holmes
he
said
we
are
all
ready
to
acknowledge
that
you
are
smart
man
and
that
you
have
your
own
methods
of
working
we
want
something
more
than
mere
theory
and
preaching
now
though
it
is
case
of
taking
the
man
have
made
my
case
out
and
it
seems
was
wrong
young
charpentier
could
not
have
been
engaged
in
this
second
affair
lestrade
went
after
his
man
stangerson
and
it
appears
that
he
was
wrong
too
you
have
thrown
out
hints
here
and
hints
there
and
seem
to
know
more
than
we
do
but
the
time
has
come
when
we
feel
that
we
have
right
to
ask
you
straight
how
much
you
do
know
of
the
business
can
you
name
the
man
who
did
it
cannot
help
feeling
that
gregson
is
right
sir
remarked
lestrade
we
have
both
tried
and
we
have
both
failed
you
have
remarked
more
than
once
since
have
been
in
the
room
that
you
had
all
the
evidence
which
you
require
surely
you
will
not
withhold
it
any
longer
any
delay
in
arresting
the
assassin
observed
might
give
him
time
to
perpetrate
some
fresh
atrocity
thus
pressed
by
us
all
holmes
showed
signs
of
irresolution
he
continued
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
with
his
head
sunk
on
his
chest
and
his
brows
drawn
down
as
was
his
habit
when
lost
in
thought
there
will
be
no
more
murders
he
said
at
last
stopping
abruptly
and
facing
us
you
can
put
that
consideration
out
of
the
question
you
have
asked
me
if
know
the
name
of
the
assassin
do
the
mere
knowing
of
his
name
is
small
thing
however
compared
with
the
power
of
laying
our
hands
upon
him
this
expect
very
shortly
to
do
have
good
hopes
of
managing
it
through
my
own
arrangements
but
it
is
thing
which
needs
delicate
handling
for
we
have
shrewd
and
desperate
man
to
deal
with
who
is
supported
as
have
had
occasion
to
prove
by
another
who
is
as
clever
as
himself
as
long
as
this
man
has
no
idea
that
anyone
can
have
clue
there
is
some
chance
of
securing
him
but
if
he
had
the
slightest
suspicion
he
would
change
his
name
and
vanish
in
an
instant
among
the
four
million
inhabitants
of
this
great
city
without
meaning
to
hurt
either
of
your
feelings
am
bound
to
say
that
consider
these
men
to
be
more
than
match
for
the
official
force
and
that
is
why
have
not
asked
your
assistance
if
fail
shall
of
course
incur
all
the
blame
due
to
this
omission
but
that
am
prepared
for
at
present
am
ready
to
promise
that
the
instant
that
can
communicate
with
you
without
endangering
my
own
combinations
shall
do
so
gregson
and
lestrade
seemed
to
be
far
from
satisfied
by
this
assurance
or
by
the
depreciating
allusion
to
the
detective
police
the
former
had
flushed
up
to
the
roots
of
his
flaxen
hair
while
the
other
beady
eyes
glistened
with
curiosity
and
resentment
neither
of
them
had
time
to
speak
however
before
there
was
tap
at
the
door
and
the
spokesman
of
the
street
arabs
young
wiggins
introduced
his
insignificant
and
unsavoury
person
please
sir
he
said
touching
his
forelock
have
the
cab
downstairs
good
boy
said
holmes
blandly
why
don
you
introduce
this
pattern
at
scotland
yard
he
continued
taking
pair
of
steel
handcuffs
from
drawer
see
how
beautifully
the
spring
works
they
fasten
in
an
instant

the
old
pattern
is
good
enough
remarked
lestrade
if
we
can
only
find
the
man
to
put
them
on
very
good
very
good
said
holmes
smiling
the
cabman
may
as
well
help
me
with
my
boxes
just
ask
him
to
step
up
wiggins
was
surprised
to
find
my
companion
speaking
as
though
he
were
about
to
set
out
on
journey
since
he
had
not
said
anything
to
me
about
it
there
was
small
portmanteau
in
the
room
and
this
he
pulled
out
and
began
to
strap
he
was
busily
engaged
at
it
when
the
cabman
entered
the
room
just
give
me
help
with
this
buckle
cabman
he
said
kneeling
over
his
task
and
never
turning
his
head
the
fellow
came
forward
with
somewhat
sullen
defiant
air
and
put
down
his
hands
to
assist
at
that
instant
there
was
sharp
click
the
jangling
of
metal
and
sherlock
holmes
sprang
to
his
feet
again
gentlemen
he
cried
with
flashing
eyes
let
me
introduce
you
to
mr
jefferson
hope
the
murderer
of
enoch
drebber
and
of
joseph
stangerson
the
whole
thing
occurred
in
moment
so
quickly
that
had
no
time
to
realize
it
have
vivid
recollection
of
that
instant
of
holmes
triumphant
expression
and
the
ring
of
his
voice
of
the
cabman
dazed
savage
face
as
he
glared
at
the
glittering
handcuffs
which
had
appeared
as
if
by
magic
upon
his
wrists
for
second
or
two
we
might
have
been
group
of
statues
then
with
an
inarticulate
roar
of
fury
the
prisoner
wrenched
himself
free
from
holmes
grasp
and
hurled
himself
through
the
window
woodwork
and
glass
gave
way
before
him
but
before
he
got
quite
through
gregson
lestrade
and
holmes
sprang
upon
him
like
so
many
staghounds
he
was
dragged
back
into
the
room
and
then
commenced
terrific
conflict
so
powerful
and
so
fierce
was
he
that
the
four
of
us
were
shaken
off
again
and
again
he
appeared
to
have
the
convulsive
strength
of
man
in
an
epileptic
fit
his
face
and
hands
were
terribly
mangled
by
his
passage
through
the
glass
but
loss
of
blood
had
no
effect
in
diminishing
his
resistance
it
was
not
until
lestrade
succeeded
in
getting
his
hand
inside
his
neckcloth
and
half
strangling
him
that
we
made
him
realize
that
his
struggles
were
of
no
avail
and
even
then
we
felt
no
security
until
we
had
pinioned
his
feet
as
well
as
his
hands
that
done
we
rose
to
our
feet
breathless
and
panting
we
have
his
cab
said
sherlock
holmes
it
will
serve
to
take
him
to
scotland
yard
and
now
gentlemen
he
continued
with
pleasant
smile
we
have
reached
the
end
of
our
little
mystery
you
are
very
welcome
to
put
any
questions
that
you
like
to
me
now
and
there
is
no
danger
that
will
refuse
to
answer
them
part
ii
the
country
of
the
saints
on
the
great
alkali
plain
in
the
central
portion
of
the
great
north
american
continent
there
lies
an
arid
and
repulsive
desert
which
for
many
long
year
served
as
barrier
against
the
advance
of
civilisation
from
the
sierra
nevada
to
nebraska
and
from
the
yellowstone
river
in
the
north
to
the
colorado
upon
the
south
is
region
of
desolation
and
silence
nor
is
nature
always
in
one
mood
throughout
this
grim
district
it
comprises
snow
capped
and
lofty
mountains
and
dark
and
gloomy
valleys
there
are
swift
flowing
rivers
which
dash
through
jagged
cañons
and
there
are
enormous
plains
which
in
winter
are
white
with
snow
and
in
summer
are
grey
with
the
saline
alkali
dust
they
all
preserve
however
the
common
characteristics
of
barrenness
inhospitality
and
misery
there
are
no
inhabitants
of
this
land
of
despair
band
of
pawnees
or
of
blackfeet
may
occasionally
traverse
it
in
order
to
reach
other
hunting
grounds
but
the
hardiest
of
the
braves
are
glad
to
lose
sight
of
those
awesome
plains
and
to
find
themselves
once
more
upon
their
prairies
the
coyote
skulks
among
the
scrub
the
buzzard
flaps
heavily
through
the
air
and
the
clumsy
grizzly
bear
lumbers
through
the
dark
ravines
and
picks
up
such
sustenance
as
it
can
amongst
the
rocks
these
are
the
sole
dwellers
in
the
wilderness
in
the
whole
world
there
can
be
no
more
dreary
view
than
that
from
the
northern
slope
of
the
sierra
blanco
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
stretches
the
great
flat
plain
land
all
dusted
over
with
patches
of
alkali
and
intersected
by
clumps
of
the
dwarfish
chaparral
bushes
on
the
extreme
verge
of
the
horizon
lie
long
chain
of
mountain
peaks
with
their
rugged
summits
flecked
with
snow
in
this
great
stretch
of
country
there
is
no
sign
of
life
nor
of
anything
appertaining
to
life
there
is
no
bird
in
the
steel
blue
heaven
no
movement
upon
the
dull
grey
earth
above
all
there
is
absolute
silence
listen
as
one
may
there
is
no
shadow
of
sound
in
all
that
mighty
wilderness
nothing
but
silence
complete
and
heart
subduing
silence
it
has
been
said
there
is
nothing
appertaining
to
life
upon
the
broad
plain
that
is
hardly
true
looking
down
from
the
sierra
blanco
one
sees
pathway
traced
out
across
the
desert
which
winds
away
and
is
lost
in
the
extreme
distance
it
is
rutted
with
wheels
and
trodden
down
by
the
feet
of
many
adventurers
here
and
there
are
scattered
white
objects
which
glisten
in
the
sun
and
stand
out
against
the
dull
deposit
of
alkali
approach
and
examine
them
they
are
bones
some
large
and
coarse
others
smaller
and
more
delicate
the
former
have
belonged
to
oxen
and
the
latter
to
men
for
fifteen
hundred
miles
one
may
trace
this
ghastly
caravan
route
by
these
scattered
remains
of
those
who
had
fallen
by
the
wayside
looking
down
on
this
very
scene
there
stood
upon
the
fourth
of
may
eighteen
hundred
and
forty
seven
solitary
traveller
his
appearance
was
such
that
he
might
have
been
the
very
genius
or
demon
of
the
region
an
observer
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
say
whether
he
was
nearer
to
forty
or
to
sixty
his
face
was
lean
and
haggard
and
the
brown
parchment
like
skin
was
drawn
tightly
over
the
projecting
bones
his
long
brown
hair
and
beard
were
all
flecked
and
dashed
with
white
his
eyes
were
sunken
in
his
head
and
burned
with
an
unnatural
lustre
while
the
hand
which
grasped
his
rifle
was
hardly
more
fleshy
than
that
of
skeleton
as
he
stood
he
leaned
upon
his
weapon
for
support
and
yet
his
tall
figure
and
the
massive
framework
of
his
bones
suggested
wiry
and
vigorous
constitution
his
gaunt
face
however
and
his
clothes
which
hung
so
baggily
over
his
shrivelled
limbs
proclaimed
what
it
was
that
gave
him
that
senile
and
decrepit
appearance
the
man
was
dying
from
hunger
and
from
thirst
he
had
toiled
painfully
down
the
ravine
and
on
to
this
little
elevation
in
the
vain
hope
of
seeing
some
signs
of
water
now
the
great
salt
plain
stretched
before
his
eyes
and
the
distant
belt
of
savage
mountains
without
sign
anywhere
of
plant
or
tree
which
might
indicate
the
presence
of
moisture
in
all
that
broad
landscape
there
was
no
gleam
of
hope
north
and
east
and
west
he
looked
with
wild
questioning
eyes
and
then
he
realised
that
his
wanderings
had
come
to
an
end
and
that
there
on
that
barren
crag
he
was
about
to
die
why
not
here
as
well
as
in
feather
bed
twenty
years
hence
he
muttered
as
he
seated
himself
in
the
shelter
of
boulder
before
sitting
down
he
had
deposited
upon
the
ground
his
useless
rifle
and
also
large
bundle
tied
up
in
grey
shawl
which
he
had
carried
slung
over
his
right
shoulder
it
appeared
to
be
somewhat
too
heavy
for
his
strength
for
in
lowering
it
came
down
on
the
ground
with
some
little
violence
instantly
there
broke
from
the
grey
parcel
little
moaning
cry
and
from
it
there
protruded
small
scared
face
with
very
bright
brown
eyes
and
two
little
speckled
dimpled
fists
you
ve
hurt
me
said
childish
voice
reproachfully
have
though
the
man
answered
penitently
didn
go
for
to
do
it
as
he
spoke
he
unwrapped
the
grey
shawl
and
extricated
pretty
little
girl
of
about
five
years
of
age
whose
dainty
shoes
and
smart
pink
frock
with
its
little
linen
apron
all
bespoke
mother
care
the
child
was
pale
and
wan
but
her
healthy
arms
and
legs
showed
that
she
had
suffered
less
than
her
companion
how
is
it
now
he
answered
anxiously
for
she
was
still
rubbing
the
towsy
golden
curls
which
covered
the
back
of
her
head
kiss
it
and
make
it
well
she
said
with
perfect
gravity
shoving
the
injured
part
up
to
him
that
what
mother
used
to
do
where
mother
gone
guess
you
ll
see
her
before
long
gone

said
the
little
girl
funny
she

say

if

to

the

fragments

mica

except
little
drop
for
the
likes
of

and

wash
yourself
interrupted
his
companion
gravely
staring
up
at
his
grimy
visage
no
nor
drink
and
mr
bender
he
was
the
fust
to
go
and

then
mrs
mcGregor

cried
the
little
girl
dropping
her
face
in
her
pinafore
and
sobbing
bitterly
yes
they
all
went
except
you
and
me
then
thought
there
was
some
chance
of
water
in
this
direction
so
heaved
you
over
my
shoulder
and
we
tramped
it
together
it
don
seem
as
though
we
ve
improved
matters
there
an
almighty
small
chance
for
us
now
do
you
mean
that
we
are
going
to
die
too
asked
the
child
checking
her
sobs
and
raising
her
tear
stained
face
guess
that
about
the
size
of
it
why
didn
you
say
so
before
she
said
laughing
gleefully
you
gave
me
such
fright
why
of
course
now
as
long
as
we
die
we
ll
be
with
mother
again
yes
you
will
dearie
and
you
too
ll
tell
her
how
awful
good
you

been
ll
bet
she
meets
us
at
the
door
of
heaven
with
big
pitcher
of
water
and
lot
of
buckwheat
cakes
hot
and
toasted
on
both
sides
like
bob
and
me
was
fond
of
how
long
will
it
be
first
don
know
not
very
long
the
man
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
northern
horizon
in
the
blue
vault
of
the
heaven
there
had
appeared
three
little
specks
which
increased
in
size
every
moment
so
rapidly
did
they
approach
they
speedily
resolved
themselves
into
three
large
brown
birds
which
circled
over
the
heads
of
the
two
wanderers
and
then
settled
upon
some
rocks
which
overlooked
them
they
were
buzzards
the
vultures
of
the
west
whose
coming
is
the
forerunner
of
death
cocks
and
hens
cried
the
little
girl
gleefully
pointing
at
their
ill
omened
forms
and
clapping
her
hands
to
make
them
rise
say
did
god
make
this
country
in
course
he
did
said
her
companion
rather
startled
by
this
unexpected
question
he
made
the
country
down
in
illinois
and
he
made
the
missouri
the
little
girl
continued
guess
somebody
else
made
the
country
in
these
parts
it
not
nearly
so
well
done
they
forgot
the
water
and
the
trees
what
would
ye
think
of
offering
up
prayer
the
man
asked
diffidently
it
ain
night
yet
she
answered
it
don
matter
it
ain
quite
regular
but
he
won
mind
that
you
bet
you
say
over
them
ones
that
you
used
to
say
every
night
in
the
waggon
when
we
was
on
the
plains
why
don
you
say
some
yourself
the
child
asked
with
wondering
eyes
disremember
them
he
answered
hain
said
none
since
was
half
the
height
that
gun
guess
it
never
too
late
you
say
them
out
and
ll
stand
by
and
come
in
on
the
choruses
then
you
ll
need
to
kneel
down
and
me
too
she
said
laying
the
shawl
out
for
that
purpose
you
ve
got
to
put
your
hands
up
like
this
it
makes
you
feel
kind
good
it
was
strange
sight
had
there
been
anything
but
the
buzzards
to
see
it
side
by
side
on
the
narrow
shawl
knelt
the
two
wanderers
the
little
prattling
child
and
the
reckless
hardened
adventurer
her
chubby
face
and
his
haggard
angular
visage
were
both
turned
up
to
the
cloudless
heaven
in
heartfelt
entreaty
to
that
dread
being
with
whom
they
were
face
to
face
while
the
two
voices
the
one
thin
and
clear
the
other
deep
and
harsh
united
in
the
entreaty
for
mercy
and
forgiveness
the
prayer
finished
they
resumed
their
seat
in
the
shadow
of
the
boulder
until
the
child
fell
asleep
nestling
upon
the
broad
breast
of
her
protector
he
watched
over
her
slumber
for
some
time
but
nature
proved
to
be
too
strong
for
him
for
three
days
and
three
nights
he
had
allowed
himself
neither
rest
nor
repose
slowly
the
eyelids
drooped
over
the
tired
eyes
and
the
head
sunk
lower
and
lower
upon
the
breast
until
the
man
grizzled
beard
was
mixed
with
the
gold
tresses
of
his
companion
and
both
slept
the
same
deep
and
dreamless
slumber
had
the
wanderer
remained
awake
for
another
half
hour
strange
sight
would
have
met
his
eyes
far
away
on
the
extreme
verge
of
the
alkali
plain
there
rose
up
little
spray
of
dust
very
slight
at
first
and
hardly
to
be
distinguished
from
the
mists
of
the
distance
but
gradually
growing
higher
and
broader
until
it
formed
solid
well
defined
cloud
this
cloud
continued
to
increase
in
size
until
it
became
evident
that
it
could
only
be
raised
by
great
multitude
of
moving
creatures
in
more
fertile
spots
the
observer
would
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
one
of
those
great
herds
of
bisons
which
graze
upon
the
prairie
land
was
approaching
him
this
was
obviously
impossible
in
these
arid
wilds
as
the
whirl
of
dust
drew
nearer
to
the
solitary
bluff
upon
which
the
two
castaways
were
reposing
the
canvas
covered
tilts
of
waggons
and
the
figures
of
armed
horsemen
began
to
show
up
through
the
haze
and
the
apparition
revealed
itself
as
being
great
caravan
upon
its
journey
for
the
west
but
what
caravan
when
the
head
of
it
had
reached
the
base
of
the
mountains
the
rear
was
not
yet
visible
on
the
horizon
right
across
the
enormous
plain
stretched
the
straggling
array
waggons
and
carts
men
on
horseback
and
men
on
foot
innumerable
women
who
staggered
along
under
burdens
and
children
who
toddled
beside
the
waggons
or
peeped
out
from
under
the
white
coverings
this
was
evidently
no
ordinary
party
of
immigrants
but
rather
some
nomad
people
who
had
been
compelled
from
stress
of
circumstances
to
seek
themselves
new
country
there
rose
through
the
clear
air
confused
clattering
and
rumbling
from
this
great
mass
of
humanity
with
the
creaking
of
wheels
and
the
neighing
of
horses
loud
as
it
was
it
was
not
sufficient
to
rouse
the
two
tired
wayfarers
above
them
at
the
head
of
the
column
there
rode
score
or
more
of
grave
iron
faced
men
clad
in
sombre
homespun
garments
and
armed
with
rifles
on
reaching
the
base
of
the
bluff
they
halted
and
held
short
council
among
themselves
the
wells
are
to
the
right
my
brothers
said
one
hard
lipped
clean
shaven
man
with
grizzly
hair
to
the
right
of
the
sierra
blanco
so
we
shall
reach
the
rio
grande
said
another
fear
not
for
water
cried
third
he
who
could
draw
it
from
the
rocks
will
not
now
abandon
his
own
chosen
people
amen
responded
the
whole
party
they
were
about
to
resume
their
journey
when
one
of
the
youngest
and
keenest
eyed
uttered
an
exclamation
and
pointed
up
at
the
rugged
crag
above
them
from
its
summit
there
fluttered
little
wisp
of
pink
showing
up
hard
and
bright
against
the
grey
rocks
behind
at
the
sight
there
was
general
reining
up
of
horses
and
unslinging
of
guns
while
fresh
horsemen
came
galloping
up
to
reinforce
the
vanguard
the
word
redskins
was
on
every
lip
there
can
be
any
number
of
injuns
here
said
the
elderly
man
who
appeared
to
be
in
command
we
have
passed
the
pawnees
and
there
are
no
other
tribes
until
we
cross
the
great
mountains
shall
go
forward
and
see
brother
stangerson
asked
one
of
the
band
and
cried
dozen
voices
leave
your
horses
below
and
we
will
await
you
here
the
elder
answered
in
moment
the
young
fellows
had
dismounted
fastened
their
horses
and
were
ascending
the
precipitous
slope
which
led
up
to
the
object
which
had
excited
their
curiosity
they
advanced
rapidly
and
noiselessly
with
the
confidence
and
dexterity
of
practised
scouts
the
watchers
from
the
plain
below
could
see
them
flit
from
rock
to
rock
until
their
figures
stood
out
against
the
sky
line
the
young
man
who
had
first
given
the
alarm
was
leading
them
suddenly
his
followers
saw
him
throw
up
his
hands
as
though
overcome
with
astonishment
and
on
joining
him
they
were
affected
in
the
same
way
by
the
sight
which
met
their
eyes
on
the
little
plateau
which
crowned
the
barren
hill
there
stood
single
giant
boulder
and
against
this
boulder
there
lay
tall
man
long
bearded
and
hard
featured
but
of
an
excessive
thinness
his
placid
face
and
regular
breathing
showed
that
he
was
fast
asleep
beside
him
lay
little
child
with
her
round
white
arms
encircling
his
brown
sinewy
neck
and
her
golden
haired
head
resting
upon
the
breast
of
his
velveteen
tunic
her
rosy
lips
were
parted
showing
the
regular
line
of
snow
white
teeth
within
and
playful
smile
played
over
her
infantile
features
her
plump
little
white
legs
terminating
in
white
socks
and
neat
shoes
with
shining
buckles
offered
strange
contrast
to
the
long
shrivelled
members
of
her
companion
on
the
ledge
of
rock
above
this
strange
couple
there
stood
three
solemn
buzzards
who
at
the
sight
of
the
new
comers
uttered
raucous
screams
of
disappointment
and
flapped
sullenly
away

the
cries
of
the
foul
birds
awoke
the
two
sleepers
who
stared
about
them
in
bewilderment
the
man
staggered
to
his
feet
and
looked
down
upon
the
plain
which
had
been
so
desolate
when
sleep
had
overtaken
him
and
which
was
now
traversed
by
this
enormous
body
of
men
and
of
beasts
his
face
assumed
an
expression
of
incredulity
as
he
gazed
and
he
passed
his
boney
hand
over
his
eyes
this
is
what
they
call
delirium
guess
he
muttered
the
child
stood
beside
him
holding
on
to
the
skirt
of
his
coat
and
said
nothing
but
looked
all
round
her
with
the
wondering
questioning
gaze
of
childhood
the
rescuing
party
were
speedily
able
to
convince
the
two
castaways
that
their
appearance
was
no
delusion
one
of
them
seized
the
little
girl
and
hoisted
her
upon
his
shoulder
while
two
others
supported
her
gaunt
companion
and
assisted
him
towards
the
waggons
my
name
is
john
ferrier
the
wanderer
explained
me
and
that
little
un
are
all
that
left
twenty
one
people
the
rest
is
all
dead
thirst
and
hunger
away
down
in
the
south
is
she
your
child
asked
someone
guess
she
is
now
the
other
cried
defiantly
she
mine
cause
saved
her
no
man
will
take
her
from
me
she
lucy
ferrier
from
this
day
on
who
are
you
though
he
continued
glancing
with
curiosity
at
his
stalwart
sunburned
rescuers
there
seems
to
be
powerful
lot
of
ye
nigh
upon
ten
thousand
said
one
of
the
young
men
we
are
the
persecuted
children
of
god
the
chosen
of
the
angel
meroni
never
heard
tell
on
him
said
the
wanderer
he
appears
to
have
chosen
fair
crowd
of
ye
do
not
jest
at
that
which
is
sacred
said
the
other
sternly
we
are
of
those
who
believe
in
those
sacred
writings
drawn
in
egyptian
letters
on
plates
of
beaten
gold
which
were
handed
unto
the
holy
joseph
smith
at
palmyra
we
have
come
from
nauvoo
in
the
state
of
illinois
where
we
had
founded
our
temple
we
have
come
to
seek
refuge
from
the
violent
man
and
from
the
godless
even
though
it
be
the
heart
of
the
desert
the
name
of
nauvoo
evidently
recalled
recollections
to
john
ferrier
see
he
said
you
are
the
mormons
we
are
the
mormons
answered
his
companions
with
one
voice
and
where
are
you
going
we
do
not
know
the
hand
of
god
is
leading
us
under
the
person
of
our
prophet
you
must
come
before
him
he
shall
say
what
is
to
be
done
with
you
they
had
reached
the
base
of
the
hill
by
this
time
and
were
surrounded
by
crowds
of
the
pilgrims
pale
faced
meek
looking
women
strong
laughing
children
and
anxious
earnest
eyed
men
many
were
the
cries
of
astonishment
and
of
commiseration
which
arose
from
them
when
they
perceived
the
youth
of
one
of
the
strangers
and
the
destitution
of
the
other
their
escort
did
not
halt
however
but
pushed
on
followed
by
great
crowd
of
mormons
until
they
reached
waggon
which
was
conspicuous
for
its
great
size
and
for
the
gaudiness
and
smartness
of
its
appearance
six
horses
were
yoked
to
it
whereas
the
others
were
furnished
with
two
or
at
most
four
piece
beside
the
driver
there
sat
man
who
could
not
have
been
more
than
thirty
years
of
age
but
whose
massive
head
and
resolute
expression
marked
him
as
leader
he
was
reading
brown
backed
volume
but
as
the
crowd
approached
he
laid
it
aside
and
listened
attentively
to
an
account
of
the
episode
then
he
turned
to
the
two
castaways
if
we
take
you
with
us
he
said
in
solemn
words
it
can
only
be
as
believers
in
our
own
creed
we
shall
have
no
wolves
in
our
fold
better
far
that
your
bones
should
bleach
in
this
wilderness
than
that
you
should
prove
to
be
that
little
speck
of
decay
which
in
time
corrupts
the
whole
fruit
will
you
come
with
us
on
these
terms
guess
ll
come
with
you
on
any
terms
said
ferrier
with
such
emphasis
that
the
grave
elders
could
not
restrain
smile
the
leader
alone
retained
his
stern
impressive
expression
take
him
brother
stangerson
he
said
give
him
food
and
drink
and
the
child
likewise
let
it
be
your
task
also
to
teach
him
our
holy
creed
we
have
delayed
long
enough
forward
on
to
zion
on
to
zion
cried
the
crowd
of
mormons
and
the
words
rippled
down
the
long
caravan
passing
from
mouth
to
mouth
until
they
died
away
in
dull
murmur
in
the
far
distance
with
cracking
of
whips
and
creaking
of
wheels
the
great
waggons
got
into
motion
and
soon
the
whole
caravan
was
winding
along
once
more
the
elder
to
whose
care
the
two
waifs
had
been
committed
led
them
to
his
waggon
where
meal
was
already
awaiting
them
you
shall
remain
here
he
said
in
few
days
you
will
have
recovered
from
your
fatigues
in
the
meantime
remember
that
now
and
for
ever
you
are
of
our
religion
brigham
young
has
said
it
and
he
has
spoken
with
the
voice
of
joseph
smith
which
is
the
voice
of
god
ii
the
flower
of
utah
this
is
not
the
place
to
commemorate
the
trials
and
privations
endured
by
the
immigrant
mormons
before
they
came
to
their
final
haven
from
the
shores
of
the
mississippi
to
the
western
slopes
of
the
rocky
mountains
they
had
struggled
on
with
constancy
almost
unparalleled
in
history
the
savage
man
and
the
savage
beast
hunger
thirst
fatigue
and
disease
every
impediment
which
nature
could
place
in
the
way
had
all
been
overcome
with
anglo
saxon
tenacity
yet
the
long
journey
and
the
accumulated
terrors
had
shaken
the
hearts
of
the
stoutest
among
them
there
was
not
one
who
did
not
sink
upon
his
knees
in
heartfelt
prayer
when
they
saw
the
broad
valley
of
utah
bathed
in
the
sunlight
beneath
them
and
learned
from
the
lips
of
their
leader
that
this
was
the
promised
land
and
that
these
virgin
acres
were
to
be
theirs
for
evermore
young
speedily
proved
himself
to
be
skilful
administrator
as
well
as
resolute
chief
maps
were
drawn
and
charts
prepared
in
which
the
future
city
was
sketched
out
all
around
farms
were
apportioned
and
allotted
in
proportion
to
the
standing
of
each
individual
the
tradesman
was
put
to
his
trade
and
the
artisan
to
his
calling
in
the
town
streets
and
squares
sprang
up
as
if
by
magic
in
the
country
there
was
draining
and
hedging
planting
and
clearing
until
the
next
summer
saw
the
whole
country
golden
with
the
wheat
crop
everything
prospered
in
the
strange
settlement
above
all
the
great
temple
which
they
had
erected
in
the
centre
of
the
city
grew
ever
taller
and
larger
from
the
first
blush
of
dawn
until
the
closing
of
the
twilight
the
clatter
of
the
hammer
and
the
rasp
of
the
saw
was
never
absent
from
the
monument
which
the
immigrants
erected
to
him
who
had
led
them
safe
through
many
dangers
the
two
castaways
john
ferrier
and
the
little
girl
who
had
shared
his
fortunes
and
had
been
adopted
as
his
daughter
accompanied
the
mormons
to
the
end
of
their
great
pilgrimage
little
lucy
ferrier
was
borne
along
pleasantly
enough
in
elder
stangerson
waggon
retreat
which
she
shared
with
the
mormon
three
wives
and
with
his
son
headstrong
forward
boy
of
twelve
having
rallied
with
the
elasticity
of
childhood
from
the
shock
caused
by
her
mother
death
she
soon
became
pet
with
the
women
and
reconciled
herself
to
this
new
life
in
her
moving
canvas
covered
home
in
the
meantime
ferrier
having
recovered
from
his
privations
distinguished
himself
as
useful
guide
and
an
indefatigable
hunter
so
rapidly
did
he
gain
the
esteem
of
his
new
companions
that
when
they
reached
the
end
of
their
wanderings
it
was
unanimously
agreed
that
he
should
be
provided
with
as
large
and
as
fertile
tract
of
land
as
any
of
the
settlers
with
the
exception
of
young
himself
and
of
stangerson
kemball
johnston
and
drebber
who
were
the
four
principal
elders
on
the
farm
thus
acquired
john
ferrier
built
himself
substantial
log
house
which
received
so
many
additions
in
succeeding
years
that
it
grew
into
roomy
villa
he
was
man
of
practical
turn
of
mind
keen
in
his
dealings
and
skilful
with
his
hands
his
iron
constitution
enabled
him
to
work
morning
and
evening
at
improving
and
tilling
his
lands
hence
it
came
about
that
his
farm
and
all
that
belonged
to
him
prospered
exceedingly
in
three
years
he
was
better
off
than
his
neighbours
in
six
he
was
well
to
do
in
nine
he
was
rich
and
in
twelve
there
were
not
half
dozen
men
in
the
whole
of
salt
lake
city
who
could
compare
with
him
from
the
great
inland
sea
to
the
distant
wasatch
mountains
there
was
no
name
better
known
than
that
of
john
ferrier
there
was
one
way
and
only
one
in
which
he
offended
the
susceptibilities
of
his
co
religionists
no
argument
or
persuasion
could
ever
induce
him
to
set
up
female
establishment
after
the
manner
of
his
companions
he
never
gave
reasons
for
this
persistent
refusal
but
contented
himself
by
resolutely
and
inflexibly
adhering
to
his
determination
there
were
some
who
accused
him
of
lukewarmness
in
his
adopted
religion
and
others
who
put
it
down
to
greed
of
wealth
and
reluctance
to
incur
expense
others
again
spoke
of
some
early
love
affair
and
of
fair
haired
girl
who
had
pined
away
on
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
whatever
the
reason
ferrier
remained
strictly
celibate
in
every
other
respect
he
conformed
to
the
religion
of
the
young
settlement
and
gained
the
name
of
being
an
orthodox
and
straight
walking
man

lucy
ferrier
grew
up
within
the
log
house
and
assisted
her
adopted
father
in
all
his
undertakings
the
keen
air
of
the
mountains
and
the
balsamic
odour
of
the
pine
trees
took
the
place
of
nurse
and
mother
to
the
young
girl
as
year
succeeded
to
year
she
grew
taller
and
stronger
her
cheek
more
ruddy
and
her
step
more
elastic
many
wayfarer
upon
the
high
road
which
ran
by
ferrier
farm
felt
long
forgotten
thoughts
revive
in
his
mind
as
he
watched
her
lithe
girlish
figure
tripping
through
the
wheatfields
or
met
her
mounted
upon
her
father
mustang
and
managing
it
with
all
the
ease
and
grace
of
true
child
of
the
west
so
the
bud
blossomed
into
flower
and
the
year
which
saw
her
father
the
richest
of
the
farmers
left
her
as
fair
specimen
of
american
girlhood
as
could
be
found
in
the
whole
pacific
slope
it
was
not
the
father
however
who
first
discovered
that
the
child
had
developed
into
the
woman
it
seldom
is
in
such
cases
that
mysterious
change
is
too
subtle
and
too
gradual
to
be
measured
by
dates
least
of
all
does
the
maiden
herself
know
it
until
the
tone
of
voice
or
the
touch
of
hand
sets
her
heart
thrilling
within
her
and
she
learns
with
mixture
of
pride
and
of
fear
that
new
and
larger
nature
has
awoken
within
her
there
are
few
who
cannot
recall
that
day
and
remember
the
one
little
incident
which
heralded
the
dawn
of
new
life
in
the
case
of
lucy
ferrier
the
occasion
was
serious
enough
in
itself
apart
from
its
future
influence
on
her
destiny
and
that
of
many
besides
it
was
warm
june
morning
and
the
latter
day
saints
were
as
busy
as
the
bees
whose
hive
they
have
chosen
for
their
emblem
in
the
fields
and
in
the
streets
rose
the
same
hum
of
human
industry
down
the
dusty
high
roads
defiled
long
streams
of
heavily
laden
mules
all
heading
to
the
west
for
the
gold
fever
had
broken
out
in
california
and
the
overland
route
lay
through
the
city
of
the
elect
there
too
were
droves
of
sheep
and
bullocks
coming
in
from
the
outlying
pasture
lands
and
trains
of
tired
immigrants
men
and
horses
equally
weary
of
their
interminable
journey
through
all
this
motley
assemblage
threading
her
way
with
the
skill
of
an
accomplished
rider
there
galloped
lucy
ferrier
her
fair
face
flushed
with
the
exercise
and
her
long
chestnut
hair
floating
out
behind
her
she
had
commission
from
her
father
in
the
city
and
was
dashing
in
as
she
had
done
many
time
before
with
all
the
fearlessness
of
youth
thinking
only
of
her
task
and
how
it
was
to
be
performed
the
travel
stained
adventurers
gazed
after
her
in
astonishment
and
even
the
unemotional
indians
journeying
in
with
their
pelties
relaxed
their
accustomed
stoicism
as
they
marvelled
at
the
beauty
of
the
pale
faced
maiden
she
had
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
city
when
she
found
the
road
blocked
by
great
drove
of
cattle
driven
by
half
dozen
wild
looking
herdsmen
from
the
plains
in
her
impatience
she
endeavoured
to
pass
this
obstacle
by
pushing
her
horse
into
what
appeared
to
be
gap
scarcely
had
she
got
fairly
into
it
however
before
the
beasts
closed
in
behind
her
and
she
found
herself
completely
embedded
in
the
moving
stream
of
fierce
eyed
long
horned
bullocks
accustomed
as
she
was
to
deal
with
cattle
she
was
not
alarmed
at
her
situation
but
took
advantage
of
every
opportunity
to
urge
her
horse
on
in
the
hopes
of
pushing
her
way
through
the
cavalcade
unfortunately
the
horns
of
one
of
the
creatures
either
by
accident
or
design
came
in
violent
contact
with
the
flank
of
the
mustang
and
excited
it
to
madness
in
an
instant
it
reared
up
upon
its
hind
legs
with
snort
of
rage
and
pranced
and
tossed
in
way
that
would
have
unseated
any
but
most
skilful
rider
the
situation
was
full
of
peril
every
plunge
of
the
excited
horse
brought
it
against
the
horns
again
and
goaded
it
to
fresh
madness
it
was
all
that
the
girl
could
do
to
keep
herself
in
the
saddle
yet
slip
would
mean
terrible
death
under
the
hoofs
of
the
unwieldy
and
terrified
animals
unaccustomed
to
sudden
emergencies
her
head
began
to
swim
and
her
grip
upon
the
bridle
to
relax
choked
by
the
rising
cloud
of
dust
and
by
the
steam
from
the
struggling
creatures
she
might
have
abandoned
her
efforts
in
despair
but
for
kindly
voice
at
her
elbow
which
assured
her
of
assistance
at
the
same
moment
sinewy
brown
hand
caught
the
frightened
horse
by
the
curb
and
forcing
way
through
the
drove
soon
brought
her
to
the
outskirts
you
re
not
hurt
hope
miss
said
her
preserver
respectfully
she
looked
up
at
his
dark
fierce
face
and
laughed
saucily
awful
frightened
she
said
naively
whoever
would
have
thought
that
poncho
would
have
been
so
scared
by
lot
of
cows
thank
god
you
kept
your
seat
the
other
said
earnestly
he
was
tall
savage
looking
young
fellow
mounted
on
powerful
roan
horse
and
clad
in
the
rough
dress
of
hunter
with
long
rifle
slung
over
his
shoulders
guess
you
are
the
daughter
of
john
ferrier
he
remarked
saw
you
ride
down
from
his
house
when
you
see
him
ask
him
if
he
remembers
the
jefferson
hopes
of
st
louis
if
he
the
same
ferrier
my
father
and
he
were
pretty
thick
hadn
you
better
come
and
ask
yourself
she
asked
demurely
the
young
fellow
seemed
pleased
at
the
suggestion
and
his
dark
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure
ll
do
so
he
said
we
ve
been
in
the
mountains
for
two
months
and
are
not
over
and
above
in
visiting
condition
he
must
take
us
as
he
finds
us
he
has
good
deal
to
thank
you
for
and
so
have
she
answered
he
awful
fond
of
me
if
those
cows
had
jumped
on
me
he
have
never
got
over
it
neither
would
said
her
companion
you
well
don
see
that
it
would
make
much
matter
to
you
anyhow
you
ain
even
friend
of
ours
the
young
hunter
dark
face
grew
so
gloomy
over
this
remark
that
lucy
ferrier
laughed
aloud
there
didn
mean
that
she
said
of
course
you
are
friend
now
you
must
come
and
see
us
now
must
push
along
or
father
won
trust
me
with
his
business
any
more
good
bye
good
bye
he
answered
raising
his
broad
sombrero
and
bending
over
her
little
hand
she
wheeled
her
mustang
round
gave
it
cut
with
her
riding
whip
and
darted
away
down
the
broad
road
in
rolling
cloud
of
dust
young
jefferson
hope
rode
on
with
his
companions
gloomy
and
taciturn
he
and
they
had
been
among
the
nevada
mountains
prospecting
for
silver
and
were
returning
to
salt
lake
city
in
the
hope
of
raising
capital
enough
to
work
some
lodes
which
they
had
discovered
he
had
been
as
keen
as
any
of
them
upon
the
business
until
this
sudden
incident
had
drawn
his
thoughts
into
another
channel
the
sight
of
the
fair
young
girl
as
frank
and
wholesome
as
the
sierra
breezes
had
stirred
his
volcanic
untamed
heart
to
its
very
depths
when
she
had
vanished
from
his
sight
he
realized
that
crisis
had
come
in
his
life
and
that
neither
silver
speculations
nor
any
other
questions
could
ever
be
of
such
importance
to
him
as
this
new
and
all
absorbing
one
the
love
which
had
sprung
up
in
his
heart
was
not
the
sudden
changeable
fancy
of
boy
but
rather
the
wild
fierce
passion
of
man
of
strong
will
and
imperious
temper
he
had
been
accustomed
to
succeed
in
all
that
he
undertook
he
swore
in
his
heart
that
he
would
not
fail
in
this
if
human
effort
and
human
perseverance
could
render
him
successful
he
called
on
john
ferrier
that
night
and
many
times
again
until
his
face
was
familiar
one
at
the
farmhouse
john
cooped
up
in
the
valley
and
absorbed
in
his
work
had
little
chance
of
learning
the
news
of
the
outside
world
during
the
last
twelve
years
all
this
jefferson
hope
was
able
to
tell
him
and
in
style
which
interested
lucy
as
well
as
her
father
he
had
been
pioneer
in
california
and
could
narrate
many
strange
tale
of
fortunes
made
and
fortunes
lost
in
those
wild
halcyon
days
he
had
been
scout
too
and
trapper
silver
explorer
and
ranchman
wherever
stirring
adventures
were
to
be
had
jefferson
hope
had
been
there
in
search
of
them
he
soon
became
favourite
with
the
old
farmer
who
spoke
eloquently
of
his
virtues
on
such
occasions
lucy
was
silent
but
her
blushing
cheek
and
her
bright
happy
eyes
showed
only
too
clearly
that
her
young
heart
was
no
longer
her
own
her
honest
father
may
not
have
observed
these
symptoms
but
they
were
assuredly
not
thrown
away
upon
the
man
who
had
won
her
affections
it
was
summer
evening
when
he
came
galloping
down
the
road
and
pulled
up
at
the
gate
she
was
at
the
doorway
and
came
down
to
meet
him
he
threw
the
bridle
over
the
fence
and
strode
up
the
pathway
am
off
lucy
he
said
taking
her
two
hands
in
his
and
gazing
tenderly
down
into
her
face
won
ask
you
to
come
with
me
now
but
will
you
be
ready
to
come
when
am
here
again
and
when
will
that
be
she
asked
blushing
and
laughing
couple
of
months
at
the
outside
will
come
and
claim
you
then
my
darling
there
no
one
who
can
stand
between
us
and
how
about
father
she
asked

has
given
his
consent

these

no

it
all
there
no
more
to
be
said
she
whispered
with
her
cheek
against
his
broad
breast
thank
god
he
said
hoarsely
stooping
and
kissing
her
it
is
settled
then
the
longer
stay
the
harder
it
will
be
to
go
they
are
waiting
for
me
at
the
cañon
good
bye
my
own
darling
good
bye
in
two
months
you
shall
see
me
he
tore
himself
from
her
as
he
spoke
and
flinging
himself
upon
his
horse
galloped
furiously
away
never
even
looking
round
as
though
afraid
that
his
resolution
might
fail
him
if
he
took
one
glance
at
what
he
was
leaving
she
stood
at
the
gate
gazing
after
him
until
he
vanished
from
her
sight
then
she
walked
back
into
the
house

john
ferrier
talks
with
the
prophet
three
weeks
had
passed
since
jefferson
hope
and
his
comrades
had
departed
from
salt
lake
city
john
ferrier
heart
was
sore
within
him
when
he
thought
of
the
young
man
return
and
of
the
impending
loss
of
his
adopted
child
yet
her
bright
and
happy
face
reconciled
him
to
the
arrangement
more
than
any
argument
could
have
done
he
had
always
determined
deep
down
in
his
resolute
heart
that
nothing
would
ever
induce
him
to
allow
his
daughter
to
wed
mormon
such
marriage
he
regarded
as
no
marriage
at
all
but
as
shame
and
disgrace
whatever
he
might
think
of
the
mormon
doctrines
upon
that
one
point
he
was
inflexible
he
had
to
seal
his
mouth
on
the
subject
however
for
to
express
an
unorthodox
opinion
was
dangerous
matter
in
those
days
in
the
land
of
the
saints
yes
dangerous
matter
so
dangerous
that
even
the
most
saintly
dared
only
whisper
their
religious
opinions
with
bated
breath
lest
something
which
fell
from
their
lips
might
be
misconstrued
and
bring
down
swift
retribution
upon
them
the
victims
of
persecution
had
now
turned
persecutors
on
their
own
account
and
persecutors
of
the
most
terrible
description
not
the
inquisition
of
seville
nor
the
german
vehmgericht
nor
the
secret
societies
of
italy
were
ever
able
to
put
more
formidable
machinery
in
motion
than
that
which
cast
cloud
over
the
state
of
utah
its
invisibility
and
the
mystery
which
was
attached
to
it
made
this
organization
doubly
terrible
it
appeared
to
be
omniscient
and
omnipotent
and
yet
was
neither
seen
nor
heard
the
man
who
held
out
against
the
church
vanished
away
and
none
knew
whither
he
had
gone
or
what
had
befallen
him
his
wife
and
his
children
awaited
him
at
home
but
no
father
ever
returned
to
tell
them
how
he
had
fared
at
the
hands
of
his
secret
judges
rash
word
or
hasty
act
was
followed
by
annihilation
and
yet
none
knew
what
the
nature
might
be
of
this
terrible
power
which
was
suspended
over
them
no
wonder
that
men
went
about
in
fear
and
trembling
and
that
even
in
the
heart
of
the
wilderness
they
dared
not
whisper
the
doubts
which
oppressed
them
at
first
this
vague
and
terrible
power
was
exercised
only
upon
the
recalcitrants
who
having
embraced
the
mormon
faith
wished
afterwards
to
pervert
or
to
abandon
it
soon
however
it
took
wider
range
the
supply
of
adult
women
was
running
short
and
polygamy
without
female
population
on
which
to
draw
was
barren
doctrine
indeed
strange
rumours
began
to
be
bandied
about
rumours
of
murdered
immigrants
and
rifled
camps
in
regions
where
indians
had
never
been
seen
fresh
women
appeared
in
the
harems
of
the
elders
women
who
pined
and
wept
and
bore
upon
their
faces
the
traces
of
an
unextinguishable
horror
belated
wanderers
upon
the
mountains
spoke
of
gangs
of
armed
men
masked
stealthy
and
noiseless
who
flitted
by
them
in
the
darkness
these
tales
and
rumours
took
substance
and
shape
and
were
corroborated
and
re
corroborated
until
they
resolved
themselves
into
definite
name
to
this
day
in
the
lonely
ranches
of
the
west
the
name
of
the
danite
band
or
the
avenging
angels
is
sinister
and
an
ill
omened
one
fuller
knowledge
of
the
organization
which
produced
such
terrible
results
served
to
increase
rather
than
to
lessen
the
horror
which
it
inspired
in
the
minds
of
men
none
knew
who
belonged
to
this
ruthless
society
the
names
of
the
participators
in
the
deeds
of
blood
and
violence
done
under
the
name
of
religion
were
kept
profoundly
secret
the
very
friend
to
whom
you
communicated
your
misgivings
as
to
the
prophet
and
his
mission
might
be
one
of
those
who
would
come
forth
at
night
with
fire
and
sword
to
exact
terrible
reparation
hence
every
man
feared
his
neighbour
and
none
spoke
of
the
things
which
were
nearest
his
heart
one
fine
morning
john
ferrier
was
about
to
set
out
to
his
wheatfields
when
he
heard
the
click
of
the
latch
and
looking
through
the
window
saw
stout
sandy
haired
middle
aged
man
coming
up
the
pathway
his
heart
leapt
to
his
mouth
for
this
was
none
other
than
the
great
brigham
young
himself
full
of
trepidation
for
he
knew
that
such
visit
boded
him
little
good
ferrier
ran
to
the
door
to
greet
the
mormon
chief
the
latter
however
received
his
salutations
coldly
and
followed
him
with
stern
face
into
the
sitting
room
brother
ferrier
he
said
taking
seat
and
eyeing
the
farmer
keenly
from
under
his
light
coloured
eyelashes
the
true
believers
have
been
good
friends
to
you
we
picked
you
up
when
you
were
starving
in
the
desert
we
shared
our
food
with
you
led
you
safe
to
the
chosen
valley
gave
you
goodly
share
of
land
and
allowed
you
to
wax
rich
under
our
protection
is
not
this
so
it
is
so
answered
john
ferrier
in
return
for
all
this
we
asked
but
one
condition
that
was
that
you
should
embrace
the
true
faith
and
conform
in
every
way
to
its
usages
this
you
promised
to
do
and
this
if
common
report
says
truly
you
have
neglected
and
how
have
neglected
it
asked
ferrier
throwing
out
his
hands
in
expostulation
have
not
given
to
the
common
fund
have
not
attended
at
the
temple
have
not
where
are
your
wives
asked
young
looking
round
him
call
them
in
that
may
greet
them
it
is
true
that
have
not
married
ferrier
answered
but
women
were
few
and
there
were
many
who
had
better
claims
than
was
not
lonely
man
had
my
daughter
to
attend
to
my
wants
it
is
of
that
daughter
that
would
speak
to
you
said
the
leader
of
the
mormons
she
has
grown
to
be
the
flower
of
utah
and
has
found
favour
in
the
eyes
of
many
who
are
high
in
the
land
john
ferrier
groaned
internally
there
are
stories
of
her
which
would
fain
disbelieve
stories
that
she
is
sealed
to
some
gentile
this
must
be
the
gossip
of
idle
tongues
what
is
the
thirteenth
rule
in
the
code
of
the
sainted
joseph
smith
let
every
maiden
of
the
true
faith
marry
one
of
the
elect
for
if
she
wed
gentile
she
commits
grievous
sin
this
being
so
it
is
impossible
that
you
who
profess
the
holy
creed
should
suffer
your
daughter
to
violate
it
john
ferrier
made
no
answer
but
he
played
nervously
with
his
riding
whip
upon
this
one
point
your
whole
faith
shall
be
tested
so
it
has
been
decided
in
the
sacred
council
of
four
the
girl
is
young
and
we
would
not
have
her
wed
grey
hairs
neither
would
we
deprive
her
of
all
choice
we
elders
have
many
heifers
but
our
children
must
also
be
provided
stangerson
has
son
and
drebber
has
son
and
either
of
them
would
gladly
welcome
your
daughter
to
their
house
let
her
choose
between
them
they
are
young
and
rich
and
of
the
true
faith
what
say
you
to
that
ferrier
remained
silent
for
some
little
time
with
his
brows
knitted
you
will
give
us
time
he
said
at
last
my
daughter
is
very
young
she
is
scarce
of
an
age
to
marry
she
shall
have
month
to
choose
said
young
rising
from
his
seat
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
shall
give
her
answer
he
was
passing
through
the
door
when
he
turned
with
flushed
face
and
flashing
eyes
it
were
better
for
you
john
ferrier
he
thundered
that
you
and
she
were
now
lying
blanched
skeletons
upon
the
sierra
blanco
than
that
you
should
put
your
weak
wills
against
the
orders
of
the
holy
four
with
threatening
gesture
of
his
hand
he
turned
from
the
door
and
ferrier
heard
his
heavy
step
scrunching
along
the
shingly
path
he
was
still
sitting
with
his
elbows
upon
his
knees
considering
how
he
should
broach
the
matter
to
his
daughter
when
soft
hand
was
laid
upon
his
and
looking
up
he
saw
her
standing
beside
him
one
glance
at
her
pale
frightened
face
showed
him
that
she
had
heard
what
had
passed
could
not
help
it
she
said
in
answer
to
his
look
his
voice
rang
through
the
house
oh
father
what
shall
we
do
don
you
scare
yourself
he
answered
drawing
her
to
him
and
passing
his
broad
rough
hand
caressingly
over
her
chestnut
hair
we
ll
fix
it
up
somehow
or
another
you
don
find
your
fancy
kind
lessening
for
this
chap
do

sob
and
squeeze
of
his
hand
was
her
only
answer
no
of
course
not
shouldn
care
to
hear
you
say
you
did
he
likely
lad
and
he
christian
which
is
more
than
these
folk
here
in
spite
all
their
praying
and
preaching
there
party
starting
for
nevada
to
morrow
and
ll
manage
to
send
him
message
letting
him
know
the
hole
we
are
in
if
know
anything
that
young
man
he
ll
be
back
here
with
speed
that
would
whip
electro
telegraphs
lucy
laughed
through
her
tears
at
her
father
description
when
he
comes
he
will
advise
us
for
the
best
but
it
is
for
you
that
am
frightened
dear
one
hears
one
hears
such
dreadful
stories
about
those
who
oppose
the
prophet
something
terrible
always
happens
to
them
but
we
haven
opposed
him
yet
her
father
answered
it
will
be
time
to
look
out
for
squalls
when
we
do
we
have
clear
month
before
us
at
the
end
of
that
guess
we
had
best
shin
out
of
utah
leave
utah
that
about
the
size
of
it
but
the
farm
we
will
raise
as
much
as
we
can
in
money
and
let
the
rest
go
to
tell
the
truth
lucy
it
isn
the
first
time
have
thought
of
doing
it
don
care
about
knuckling
under
to
any
man
as
these
folk
do
to
their
darned
prophet
free
born
american
and
it
all
new
to
me
guess
too
old
to
learn
if
he
comes
browsing
about
this
farm
he
might
chance
to
run
up
against
charge
of
buckshot
travelling
in
the
opposite
direction
but
they
won
let
us
leave
his
daughter
objected
wait
till
jefferson
comes
and
we
ll
soon
manage
that
in
the
meantime
don
you
fret
yourself
my
dearie
and
don
get
your
eyes
swelled
up
else
he
ll
be
walking
into
me
when
he
sees
you
there
nothing
to
be
afeared
about
and
there
no
danger
at
all
john
ferrier
uttered
these
consoling
remarks
in
very
confident
tone
but
she
could
not
help
observing
that
he
paid
unusual
care
to
the
fastening
of
the
doors
that
night
and
that
he
carefully
cleaned
and
loaded
the
rusty
old
shotgun
which
hung
upon
the
wall
of
his
bedroom
iv
flight
for
life
on
the
morning
which
followed
his
interview
with
the
mormon
prophet
john
ferrier
went
in
to
salt
lake
city
and
having
found
his
acquaintance
who
was
bound
for
the
nevada
mountains
he
entrusted
him
with
his
message
to
jefferson
hope
in
it
he
told
the
young
man
of
the
imminent
danger
which
threatened
them
and
how
necessary
it
was
that
he
should
return
having
done
thus
he
felt
easier
in
his
mind
and
returned
home
with
lighter
heart
as
he
approached
his
farm
he
was
surprised
to
see
horse
hitched
to
each
of
the
posts
of
the
gate
still
more
surprised
was
he
on
entering
to
find
two
young
men
in
possession
of
his
sitting
room
one
with
long
pale
face
was
leaning
back
in
the
rocking
chair
with
his
feet
cocked
up
upon
the
stove
the
other
bull
necked
youth
with
coarse
bloated
features
was
standing
in
front
of
the
window
with
his
hands
in
his
pocket
whistling
popular
hymn
both
of
them
nodded
to
ferrier
as
he
entered
and
the
one
in
the
rocking
chair
commenced
the
conversation
maybe
you
don
know
us
he
said
this
here
is
the
son
of
elder
drebber
and
joseph
stangerson
who
travelled
with
you
in
the
desert
when
the
lord
stretched
out
his
hand
and
gathered
you
into
the
true
fold
as
he
will
all
the
nations
in
his
own
good
time
said
the
other
in
nasal
voice
he
grindeth
slowly
but
exceeding
small
john
ferrier
bowed
coldly
he
had
guessed
who
his
visitors
were
we
have
come
continued
stangerson
at
the
advice
of
our
fathers
to
solicit
the
hand
of
your
daughter
for
whichever
of
us
may
seem
good
to
you
and
to
her
as
have
but
four
wives
and
brother
drebber
here
has
seven
it
appears
to
me
that
my
claim
is
the
stronger
one
nay
brother
stangerson
cried
the
other
the
question
is
not
how
many
wives
we
have
but
how
many
we
can
keep
my
father
has
now
given
over
his
mills
to
me
and
am
the
richer
man
but
my
prospects
are
better
said
the
other
warmly
when
the
lord
removes
my
father
shall
have
his
tanning
yard
and
his
leather
factory
then
am
your
elder
and
am
higher
in
the
church
it
will
be
for
the
maiden
to
decide
rejoined
young
drebber
smirking
at
his
own
reflection
in
the
glass
we
will
leave
it
all
to
her
decision
during
this
dialogue
john
ferrier
had
stood
fuming
in
the
doorway
hardly
able
to
keep
his
riding
whip
from
the
backs
of
his
two
visitors
look
here
he
said
at
last
striding
up
to
them
when
my
daughter
summons
you
can
come
but
until
then
don
want
to
see
your
faces
again
the
two
young
mormons
stared
at
him
in
amazement
in
their
eyes
this
competition
between
them
for
the
maiden
hand
was
the
highest
of
honours
both
to
her
and
her
father
there
are
two
ways
out
of
the
room
cried
ferrier
there
is
the
door
and
there
is
the
window
which
do
you
care
to
use
his
brown
face
looked
so
savage
and
his
gaunt
hands
so
threatening
that
his
visitors
sprang
to
their
feet
and
beat
hurried
retreat
the
old
farmer
followed
them
to
the
door
let
me
know
when
you
have
settled
which
it
is
to
be
he
said
sardonically
you
shall
smart
for
this
stangerson
cried
white
with
rage
you
have
defied
the
prophet
and
the
council
of
four
you
shall
rue
it
to
the
end
of
your
days
the
hand
of
the
lord
shall
be
heavy
upon
you
cried
young
drebber
he
will
arise
and
smite
you
then
ll
start
the
smiting
exclaimed
ferrier
furiously
and
would
have
rushed
upstairs
for
his
gun
had
not
lucy
seized
him
by
the
arm
and
restrained
him
before
he
could
escape
from
her
the
clatter
of
horses
hoofs
told
him
that
they
were
beyond
his
reach
the
young
canting
rascals
he
exclaimed
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
would
sooner
see
you
in
your
grave
my
girl
than
the
wife
of
either
of
them
and
so
should
father
she
answered
with
spirit
but
jefferson
will
soon
be
here
yes
it
will
not
be
long
before
he
comes
the
sooner
the
better
for
we
do
not
know
what
their
next
move
may
be
it
was
indeed
high
time
that
someone
capable
of
giving
advice
and
help
should
come
to
the
aid
of
the
sturdy
old
farmer
and
his
adopted
daughter
in
the
whole
history
of
the
settlement
there
had
never
been
such
case
of
rank
disobedience
to
the
authority
of
the
elders
if
minor
errors
were
punished
so
sternly
what
would
be
the
fate
of
this
arch
rebel
ferrier
knew
that
his
wealth
and
position
would
be
of
no
avail
to
him
others
as
well
known
and
as
rich
as
himself
had
been
spirited
away
before
now
and
their
goods
given
over
to
the
church
he
was
brave
man
but
he
trembled
at
the
vague
shadowy
terrors
which
hung
over
him
any
known
danger
he
could
face
with
firm
lip
but
this
suspense
was
unnerving
he
concealed
his
fears
from
his
daughter
however
and
affected
to
make
light
of
the
whole
matter
though
she
with
the
keen
eye
of
love
saw
plainly
that
he
was
ill
at
ease
he
expected
that
he
would
receive
some
message
or
remonstrance
from
young
as
to
his
conduct
and
he
was
not
mistaken
though
it
came
in
an
unlooked
for
manner
upon
rising
next
morning
he
found
to
his
surprise
small
square
of
paper
pinned
on
to
the
coverlet
of
his
bed
just
over
his
chest
on
it
was
printed
in
bold
straggling
letters
twenty
nine
days
are
given
you
for
amendment
and
then
the
dash
was
more
fear
inspiring
than
any
threat
could
have
been
how
this
warning
came
into
his
room
puzzled
john
ferrier
sorely
for
his
servants
slept
in
an
outhouse
and
the
doors
and
windows
had
all
been
secured
he
crumpled
the
paper
up
and
said
nothing
to
his
daughter
but
the
incident
struck
chill
into
his
heart
the
twenty
nine
days
were
evidently
the
balance
of
the
month
which
young
had
promised
what
strength
or
courage
could
avail
against
an
enemy
armed
with
such
mysterious
powers
the
hand
which
fastened
that
pin
might
have
struck
him
to
the
heart
and
he
could
never
have
known
who
had
slain
him
still
more
shaken
was
he
next
morning
they
had
sat
down
to
their
breakfast
when
lucy
with
cry
of
surprise
pointed
upwards
in
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
was
scrawled
with
burned
stick
apparently
the
number
28
to
his
daughter
it
was
unintelligible
and
he
did
not
enlighten
her
that
night
he
sat
up
with
his
gun
and
kept
watch
and
ward
he
saw
and
he
heard
nothing
and
yet
in
the
morning
great
27
had
been
painted
upon
the
outside
of
his
door
thus
day
followed
day
and
as
sure
as
morning
came
he
found
that
his
unseen
enemies
had
kept
their
register
and
had
marked
up
in
some
conspicuous
position
how
many
days
were
still
left
to
him
out
of
the
month
of
grace
sometimes
the
fatal
numbers
appeared
upon
the
walls
sometimes
upon
the
floors
occasionally
they
were
on
small
placards
stuck
upon
the
garden
gate
or
the
railings
with
all
his
vigilance
john
ferrier
could
not
discover
whence
these
daily
warnings
proceeded
horror
which
was
almost
superstitious
came
upon
him
at
the
sight
of
them
he
became
haggard
and
restless
and
his
eyes
had
the
troubled
look
of
some
hunted
creature
he
had
but
one
hope
in
life
now
and
that
was
for
the
arrival
of
the
young
hunter
from
nevada

twenty
had
changed
to
fifteen
and
fifteen
to
ten
but
there
was
no
news
of
the
absentee
one
by
one
the
numbers
dwindled
down
and
still
there
came
no
sign
of
him
whenever
horseman
clattered
down
the
road
or
driver
shouted
at
his
team
the
old
farmer
hurried
to
the
gate
thinking
that
help
had
arrived
at
last
at
last
when
he
saw
five
give
way
to
four
and
that
again
to
three
he
lost
heart
and
abandoned
all
hope
of
escape
single
handed
and
with
his
limited
knowledge
of
the
mountains
which
surrounded
the
settlement
he
knew
that
he
was
powerless
the
more
frequented
roads
were
strictly
watched
and
guarded
and
none
could
pass
along
them
without
an
order
from
the
council
turn
which
way
he
would
there
appeared
to
be
no
avoiding
the
blow
which
hung
over
him
yet
the
old
man
never
wavered
in
his
resolution
to
part
with
life
itself
before
he
consented
to
what
he
regarded
as
his
daughter
dishonour
he
was
sitting
alone
one
evening
pondering
deeply
over
his
troubles
and
searching
vainly
for
some
way
out
of
them
that
morning
had
shown
the
figure
upon
the
wall
of
his
house
and
the
next
day
would
be
the
last
of
the
allotted
time
what
was
to
happen
then
all
manner
of
vague
and
terrible
fancies
filled
his
imagination
and
his
daughter
what
was
to
become
of
her
after
he
was
gone
was
there
no
escape
from
the
invisible
network
which
was
drawn
all
round
them
he
sank
his
head
upon
the
table
and
sobbed
at
the
thought
of
his
own
impotence
what
was
that
in
the
silence
he
heard
gentle
scratching
sound
low
but
very
distinct
in
the
quiet
of
the
night
it
came
from
the
door
of
the
house
ferrier
crept
into
the
hall
and
listened
intently
there
was
pause
for
few
moments
and
then
the
low
insidious
sound
was
repeated
someone
was
evidently
tapping
very
gently
upon
one
of
the
panels
of
the
door
was
it
some
midnight
assassin
who
had
come
to
carry
out
the
murderous
orders
of
the
secret
tribunal
or
was
it
some
agent
who
was
marking
up
that
the
last
day
of
grace
had
arrived
john
ferrier
felt
that
instant
death
would
be
better
than
the
suspense
which
shook
his
nerves
and
chilled
his
heart
springing
forward
he
drew
the
bolt
and
threw
the
door
open
outside
all
was
calm
and
quiet
the
night
was
fine
and
the
stars
were
twinkling
brightly
overhead
the
little
front
garden
lay
before
the
farmer
eyes
bounded
by
the
fence
and
gate
but
neither
there
nor
on
the
road
was
any
human
being
to
be
seen
with
sigh
of
relief
ferrier
looked
to
right
and
to
left
until
happening
to
glance
straight
down
at
his
own
feet
he
saw
to
his
astonishment
man
lying
flat
upon
his
face
upon
the
ground
with
arms
and
legs
all
asprawl
so
unnerved
was
he
at
the
sight
that
he
leaned
up
against
the
wall
with
his
hand
to
his
throat
to
stifle
his
inclination
to
call
out
his
first
thought
was
that
the
prostrate
figure
was
that
of
some
wounded
or
dying
man
but
as
he
watched
it
he
saw
it
writhe
along
the
ground
and
into
the
hall
with
the
rapidity
and
noiselessness
of
serpent
once
within
the
house
the
man
sprang
to
his
feet
closed
the
door
and
revealed
to
the
astonished
farmer
the
fierce
face
and
resolute
expression
of
jefferson
hope
good
god
gasped
john
ferrier
how
you
scared
me
whatever
made
you
come
in
like
that
give
me
food
the
other
said
hoarsely
have
had
no
time
for
bit
or
sup
for
eight
and
forty
hours
he
flung
himself
upon
the
cold
meat
and
bread
which
were
still
lying
upon
the
table
from
his
host
supper
and
devoured
it
voraciously
does
lucy
bear
up
well
he
asked
when
he
had
satisfied
his
hunger
yes
she
does
not
know
the
danger
her
father
answered
that
is
well
the
house
is
watched
on
every
side
that
is
why
crawled
my
way
up
to
it
they
may
be
darned
sharp
but
they
re
not
quite
sharp
enough
to
catch
washoe
hunter
john
ferrier
felt
different
man
now
that
he
realized
that
he
had
devoted
ally
he
seized
the
young
man
leathery
hand
and
wrung
it
cordially
you
re
man
to
be
proud
of
he
said
there
are
not
many
who
would
come
to
share
our
danger
and
our
troubles
you
ve
hit
it
there
pard
the
young
hunter
answered
have
respect
for
you
but
if
you
were
alone
in
this
business
think
twice
before
put
my
head
into
such
hornet
nest
it
lucy
that
brings
me
here
and
before
harm
comes
on
her
guess
there
will
be
one
less
the
hope
family
in
utah
what
are
we
to
do
to
morrow
is
your
last
day
and
unless
you
act
to
night
you
are
lost
have
mule
and
two
horses
waiting
in
the
eagle
ravine
how
much
money
have
you
two
thousand
dollars
in
gold
and
five
in
notes
that
will
do
have
as
much
more
to
add
to
it
we
must
push
for
carson
city
through
the
mountains
you
had
best
wake
lucy
it
is
as
well
that
the
servants
do
not
sleep
in
the
house
while
ferrier
was
absent
preparing
his
daughter
for
the
approaching
journey
jefferson
hope
packed
all
the
eatables
that
he
could
find
into
small
parcel
and
filled
stoneware
jar
with
water
for
he
knew
by
experience
that
the
mountain
wells
were
few
and
far
between
he
had
hardly
completed
his
arrangements
before
the
farmer
returned
with
his
daughter
all
dressed
and
ready
for
start
the
greeting
between
the
lovers
was
warm
but
brief
for
minutes
were
precious
and
there
was
much
to
be
done
we
must
make
our
start
at
once
said
jefferson
hope
speaking
in
low
but
resolute
voice
like
one
who
realizes
the
greatness
of
the
peril
but
has
steeled
his
heart
to
meet
it
the
front
and
back
entrances
are
watched
but
with
caution
we
may
get
away
through
the
side
window
and
across
the
fields
once
on
the
road
we
are
only
two
miles
from
the
ravine
where
the
horses
are
waiting
by
daybreak
we
should
be
halfway
through
the
mountains
what
if
we
are
stopped
asked
ferrier
hope
slapped
the
revolver
butt
which
protruded
from
the
front
of
his
tunic
if
they
are
too
many
for
us
we
shall
take
two
or
three
of
them
with
us
he
said
with
sinister
smile
the
lights
inside
the
house
had
all
been
extinguished
and
from
the
darkened
window
ferrier
peered
over
the
fields
which
had
been
his
own
and
which
he
was
now
about
to
abandon
for
ever
he
had
long
nerved
himself
to
the
sacrifice
however
and
the
thought
of
the
honour
and
happiness
of
his
daughter
outweighed
any
regret
at
his
ruined
fortunes
all
looked
so
peaceful
and
happy
the
rustling
trees
and
the
broad
silent
stretch
of
grain
land
that
it
was
difficult
to
realize
that
the
spirit
of
murder
lurked
through
it
all
yet
the
white
face
and
set
expression
of
the
young
hunter
showed
that
in
his
approach
to
the
house
he
had
seen
enough
to
satisfy
him
upon
that
head
ferrier
carried
the
bag
of
gold
and
notes
jefferson
hope
had
the
scanty
provisions
and
water
while
lucy
had
small
bundle
containing
few
of
her
more
valued
possessions
opening
the
window
very
slowly
and
carefully
they
waited
until
dark
cloud
had
somewhat
obscured
the
night
and
then
one
by
one
passed
through
into
the
little
garden
with
bated
breath
and
crouching
figures
they
stumbled
across
it
and
gained
the
shelter
of
the
hedge
which
they
skirted
until
they
came
to
the
gap
which
opened
into
the
cornfields
they
had
just
reached
this
point
when
the
young
man
seized
his
two
companions
and
dragged
them
down
into
the
shadow
where
they
lay
silent
and
trembling
it
was
as
well
that
his
prairie
training
had
given
jefferson
hope
the
ears
of
lynx
he
and
his
friends
had
hardly
crouched
down
before
the
melancholy
hooting
of
mountain
owl
was
heard
within
few
yards
of
them
which
was
immediately
answered
by
another
hoot
at
small
distance
at
the
same
moment
vague
shadowy
figure
emerged
from
the
gap
for
which
they
had
been
making
and
uttered
the
plaintive
signal
cry
again
on
which
second
man
appeared
out
of
the
obscurity
to
morrow
at
midnight
said
the
first
who
appeared
to
be
in
authority
when
the
whip
poor
will
calls
three
times
it
is
well
returned
the
other
shall
tell
brother
drebber
pass
it
on
to
him
and
from
him
to
the
others
nine
to
seven
to
five
repeated
the
other
and
the
two
figures
flitted
away
in
different
directions
their
concluding
words
had
evidently
been
some
form
of
sign
and
countersign
the
instant
that
their
footsteps
had
died
away
in
the
distance
jefferson
hope
sprang
to
his
feet
and
helping
his
companions
through
the
gap
led
the
way
across
the
fields
at
the
top
of
his
speed
supporting
and
half
carrying
the
girl
when
her
strength
appeared
to
fail
her
hurry
on
hurry
on
he
gasped
from
time
to
time
we
are
through
the
line
of
sentinels
everything
depends
on
speed
hurry
on
once
on
the
high
road
they
made
rapid
progress
only
once
did
they
meet
anyone
and
then
they
managed
to
slip
into
field
and
so
avoid
recognition
before
reaching
the
town
the
hunter
branched
away
into
rugged
and
narrow
footpath
which
led
to
the
mountains
two
dark
jagged
peaks
loomed
above
them
through
the
darkness
and
the
defile
which
led
between
them
was
the
eagle
cañon
in
which
the
horses
were
awaiting
them
with
unerring
instinct
jefferson
hope
picked
his
way
among
the
great
boulders
and
along
the
bed
of
dried
up
watercourse
until
he
came
to
the
retired
corner
screened
with
rocks
where
the
faithful
animals
had
been
picketed
the
girl
was
placed
upon
the
mule
and
old
ferrier
upon
one
of
the
horses
with
his
money
bag
while
jefferson
hope
led
the
other
along
the
precipitous
and
dangerous
path

it
was
bewildering
route
for
anyone
who
was
not
accustomed
to
face
nature
in
her
wildest
moods
on
the
one
side
great
crag
towered
up
thousand
feet
or
more
black
stern
and
menacing
with
long
basaltic
columns
upon
its
rugged
surface
like
the
ribs
of
some
petrified
monster
on
the
other
hand
wild
chaos
of
boulders
and
debris
made
all
advance
impossible
between
the
two
ran
the
irregular
track
so
narrow
in
places
that
they
had
to
travel
in
indian
file
and
so
rough
that
only
practised
riders
could
have
traversed
it
at
all
yet
in
spite
of
all
dangers
and
difficulties
the
hearts
of
the
fugitives
were
light
within
them
for
every
step
increased
the
distance
between
them
and
the
terrible
despotism
from
which
they
were
flying
they
soon
had
proof
however
that
they
were
still
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
saints
they
had
reached
the
very
wildest
and
most
desolate
portion
of
the
pass
when
the
girl
gave
startled
cry
and
pointed
upwards
on
rock
which
overlooked
the
track
showing
out
dark
and
plain
against
the
sky
there
stood
solitary
sentinel
he
saw
them
as
soon
as
they
perceived
him
and
his
military
challenge
of
who
goes
there
rang
through
the
silent
ravine
travellers
for
nevada
said
jefferson
hope
with
his
hand
upon
the
rifle
which
hung
by
his
saddle
they
could
see
the
lonely
watcher
fingering
his
gun
and
peering
down
at
them
as
if
dissatisfied
at
their
reply
by
whose
permission
he
asked
the
holy
four
answered
ferrier
his
mormon
experiences
had
taught
him
that
was
the
highest
authority
to
which
he
could
refer
nine
to
seven
cried
the
sentinel
seven
to
five
returned
jefferson
hope
promptly
remembering
the
countersign
which
he
had
heard
in
the
garden
pass
and
the
lord
go
with
you
said
the
voice
from
above
beyond
his
post
the
path
broadened
out
and
the
horses
were
able
to
break
into
trot
looking
back
they
could
see
the
solitary
watcher
leaning
upon
his
gun
and
knew
that
they
had
passed
the
outlying
post
of
the
chosen
people
and
that
freedom
lay
before
them
the
avenging
angels
all
night
their
course
lay
through
intricate
defiles
and
over
irregular
and
rock
strewn
paths
more
than
once
they
lost
their
way
but
hope
intimate
knowledge
of
the
mountains
enabled
them
to
regain
the
track
once
more
when
morning
broke
scene
of
marvellous
though
savage
beauty
lay
before
them
in
every
direction
the
great
snow
capped
peaks
hemmed
them
in
peeping
over
each
other
shoulders
to
the
far
horizon
so
steep
were
the
rocky
banks
on
either
side
of
them
that
the
larch
and
the
pine
seemed
to
be
suspended
over
their
heads
and
to
need
only
gust
of
wind
to
come
hurtling
down
upon
them
nor
was
the
fear
entirely
an
illusion
for
the
barren
valley
was
thickly
strewn
with
trees
and
boulders
which
had
fallen
in
similar
manner
even
as
they
passed
great
rock
came
thundering
down
with
hoarse
rattle
which
woke
the
echoes
in
the
silent
gorges
and
startled
the
weary
horses
into
gallop
as
the
sun
rose
slowly
above
the
eastern
horizon
the
caps
of
the
great
mountains
lit
up
one
after
the
other
like
lamps
at
festival
until
they
were
all
ruddy
and
glowing
the
magnificent
spectacle
cheered
the
hearts
of
the
three
fugitives
and
gave
them
fresh
energy
at
wild
torrent
which
swept
out
of
ravine
they
called
halt
and
watered
their
horses
while
they
partook
of
hasty
breakfast
lucy
and
her
father
would
fain
have
rested
longer
but
jefferson
hope
was
inexorable
they
will
be
upon
our
track
by
this
time
he
said
everything
depends
upon
our
speed
once
safe
in
carson
we
may
rest
for
the
remainder
of
our
lives
during
the
whole
of
that
day
they
struggled
on
through
the
defiles
and
by
evening
they
calculated
that
they
were
more
than
thirty
miles
from
their
enemies
at
night
time
they
chose
the
base
of
beetling
crag
where
the
rocks
offered
some
protection
from
the
chill
wind
and
there
huddled
together
for
warmth
they
enjoyed
few
hours
sleep
before
daybreak
however
they
were
up
and
on
their
way
once
more
they
had
seen
no
signs
of
any
pursuers
and
jefferson
hope
began
to
think
that
they
were
fairly
out
of
the
reach
of
the
terrible
organization
whose
enmity
they
had
incurred
he
little
knew
how
far
that
iron
grasp
could
reach
or
how
soon
it
was
to
close
upon
them
and
crush
them
about
the
middle
of
the
second
day
of
their
flight
their
scanty
store
of
provisions
began
to
run
out
this
gave
the
hunter
little
uneasiness
however
for
there
was
game
to
be
had
among
the
mountains
and
he
had
frequently
before
had
to
depend
upon
his
rifle
for
the
needs
of
life
choosing
sheltered
nook
he
piled
together
few
dried
branches
and
made
blazing
fire
at
which
his
companions
might
warm
themselves
for
they
were
now
nearly
five
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
level
and
the
air
was
bitter
and
keen
having
tethered
the
horses
and
bade
lucy
adieu
he
threw
his
gun
over
his
shoulder
and
set
out
in
search
of
whatever
chance
might
throw
in
his
way
looking
back
he
saw
the
old
man
and
the
young
girl
crouching
over
the
blazing
fire
while
the
three
animals
stood
motionless
in
the
back
ground
then
the
intervening
rocks
hid
them
from
his
view
he
walked
for
couple
of
miles
through
one
ravine
after
another
without
success
though
from
the
marks
upon
the
bark
of
the
trees
and
other
indications
he
judged
that
there
were
numerous
bears
in
the
vicinity
at
last
after
two
or
three
hours
fruitless
search
he
was
thinking
of
turning
back
in
despair
when
casting
his
eyes
upwards
he
saw
sight
which
sent
thrill
of
pleasure
through
his
heart
on
the
edge
of
jutting
pinnacle
three
or
four
hundred
feet
above
him
there
stood
creature
somewhat
resembling
sheep
in
appearance
but
armed
with
pair
of
gigantic
horns
the
big
horn
for
so
it
is
called
was
acting
probably
as
guardian
over
flock
which
were
invisible
to
the
hunter
but
fortunately
it
was
heading
in
the
opposite
direction
and
had
not
perceived
him
lying
on
his
face
he
rested
his
rifle
upon
rock
and
took
long
and
steady
aim
before
drawing
the
trigger
the
animal
sprang
into
the
air
tottered
for
moment
upon
the
edge
of
the
precipice
and
then
came
crashing
down
into
the
valley
beneath
the
creature
was
too
unwieldy
to
lift
so
the
hunter
contented
himself
with
cutting
away
one
haunch
and
part
of
the
flank
with
this
trophy
over
his
shoulder
he
hastened
to
retrace
his
steps
for
the
evening
was
already
drawing
in
he
had
hardly
started
however
before
he
realized
the
difficulty
which
faced
him
in
his
eagerness
he
had
wandered
far
past
the
ravines
which
were
known
to
him
and
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
pick
out
the
path
which
he
had
taken
the
valley
in
which
he
found
himself
divided
and
sub
divided
into
many
gorges
which
were
so
like
each
other
that
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
one
from
the
other
he
followed
one
for
mile
or
more
until
he
came
to
mountain
torrent
which
he
was
sure
that
he
had
never
seen
before
convinced
that
he
had
taken
the
wrong
turn
he
tried
another
but
with
the
same
result
night
was
coming
on
rapidly
and
it
was
almost
dark
before
he
at
last
found
himself
in
defile
which
was
familiar
to
him
even
then
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
keep
to
the
right
track
for
the
moon
had
not
yet
risen
and
the
high
cliffs
on
either
side
made
the
obscurity
more
profound
weighed
down
with
his
burden
and
weary
from
his
exertions
he
stumbled
along
keeping
up
his
heart
by
the
reflection
that
every
step
brought
him
nearer
to
lucy
and
that
he
carried
with
him
enough
to
ensure
them
food
for
the
remainder
of
their
journey
he
had
now
come
to
the
mouth
of
the
very
defile
in
which
he
had
left
them
even
in
the
darkness
he
could
recognize
the
outline
of
the
cliffs
which
bounded
it
they
must
he
reflected
be
awaiting
him
anxiously
for
he
had
been
absent
nearly
five
hours
in
the
gladness
of
his
heart
he
put
his
hands
to
his
mouth
and
made
the
glen
re
echo
to
loud
halloo
as
signal
that
he
was
coming
he
paused
and
listened
for
an
answer
none
came
save
his
own
cry
which
clattered
up
the
dreary
silent
ravines
and
was
borne
back
to
his
ears
in
countless
repetitions
again
he
shouted
even
louder
than
before
and
again
no
whisper
came
back
from
the
friends
whom
he
had
left
such
short
time
ago
vague
nameless
dread
came
over
him
and
he
hurried
onwards
frantically
dropping
the
precious
food
in
his
agitation
when
he
turned
the
corner
he
came
full
in
sight
of
the
spot
where
the
fire
had
been
lit
there
was
still
glowing
pile
of
wood
ashes
there
but
it
had
evidently
not
been
tended
since
his
departure
the
same
dead
silence
still
reigned
all
round
with
his
fears
all
changed
to
convictions
he
hurried
on
there
was
no
living
creature
near
the
remains
of
the
fire
animals
man
maiden
all
were
gone
it
was
only
too
clear
that
some
sudden
and
terrible
disaster
had
occurred
during
his
absence
disaster
which
had
embraced
them
all
and
yet
had
left
no
traces
behind
it

bewildered
and
stunned
by
this
blow
jefferson
hope
felt
his
head
spin
round
and
had
to
lean
upon
his
rifle
to
save
himself
from
falling
he
was
essentially
man
of
action
however
and
speedily
recovered
from
his
temporary
impotence
seizing
half
consumed
piece
of
wood
from
the
smouldering
fire
he
blew
it
into
flame
and
proceeded
with
its
help
to
examine
the
little
camp
the
ground
was
all
stamped
down
by
the
feet
of
horses
showing
that
large
party
of
mounted
men
had
overtaken
the
fugitives
and
the
direction
of
their
tracks
proved
that
they
had
afterwards
turned
back
to
salt
lake
city
had
they
carried
back
both
of
his
companions
with
them
jefferson
hope
had
almost
persuaded
himself
that
they
must
have
done
so
when
his
eye
fell
upon
an
object
which
made
every
nerve
of
his
body
tingle
within
him
little
way
on
one
side
of
the
camp
was
low
lying
heap
of
reddish
soil
which
had
assuredly
not
been
there
before
there
was
no
mistaking
it
for
anything
but
newly
dug
grave
as
the
young
hunter
approached
it
he
perceived
that
stick
had
been
planted
on
it
with
sheet
of
paper
stuck
in
the
cleft
fork
of
it
the
inscription
upon
the
paper
was
brief
but
to
the
point
john
ferrier
formerly
of
salt
lake
city
died
august
4th
1860
the
sturdy
old
man
whom
he
had
left
so
short
time
before
was
gone
then
and
this
was
all
his
epitaph
jefferson
hope
looked
wildly
round
to
see
if
there
was
second
grave
but
there
was
no
sign
of
one
lucy
had
been
carried
back
by
their
terrible
pursuers
to
fulfil
her
original
destiny
by
becoming
one
of
the
harem
of
an
elder
son
as
the
young
fellow
realized
the
certainty
of
her
fate
and
his
own
powerlessness
to
prevent
it
he
wished
that
he
too
was
lying
with
the
old
farmer
in
his
last
silent
resting
place
again
however
his
active
spirit
shook
off
the
lethargy
which
springs
from
despair
if
there
was
nothing
else
left
to
him
he
could
at
least
devote
his
life
to
revenge
with
indomitable
patience
and
perseverance
jefferson
hope
possessed
also
power
of
sustained
vindictiveness
which
he
may
have
learned
from
the
indians
amongst
whom
he
had
lived
as
he
stood
by
the
desolate
fire
he
felt
that
the
only
one
thing
which
could
assuage
his
grief
would
be
thorough
and
complete
retribution
brought
by
his
own
hand
upon
his
enemies
his
strong
will
and
untiring
energy
should
he
determined
be
devoted
to
that
one
end
with
grim
white
face
he
retraced
his
steps
to
where
he
had
dropped
the
food
and
having
stirred
up
the
smouldering
fire
he
cooked
enough
to
last
him
for
few
days
this
he
made
up
into
bundle
and
tired
as
he
was
he
set
himself
to
walk
back
through
the
mountains
upon
the
track
of
the
avenging
angels
for
five
days
he
toiled
footsore
and
weary
through
the
defiles
which
he
had
already
traversed
on
horseback
at
night
he
flung
himself
down
among
the
rocks
and
snatched
few
hours
of
sleep
but
before
daybreak
he
was
always
well
on
his
way
on
the
sixth
day
he
reached
the
eagle
cañon
from
which
they
had
commenced
their
ill
fated
flight
thence
he
could
look
down
upon
the
home
of
the
saints
worn
and
exhausted
he
leaned
upon
his
rifle
and
shook
his
gaunt
hand
fiercely
at
the
silent
widespread
city
beneath
him
as
he
looked
at
it
he
observed
that
there
were
flags
in
some
of
the
principal
streets
and
other
signs
of
festivity
he
was
still
speculating
as
to
what
this
might
mean
when
he
heard
the
clatter
of
horse
hoofs
and
saw
mounted
man
riding
towards
him
as
he
approached
he
recognized
him
as
mormon
named
cowper
to
whom
he
had
rendered
services
at
different
times
he
therefore
accosted
him
when
he
got
up
to
him
with
the
object
of
finding
out
what
lucy
ferrier
fate
had
been
am
jefferson
hope
he
said
you
remember
me
the
mormon
looked
at
him
with
undisguised
astonishment
indeed
it
was
difficult
to
recognize
in
this
tattered
unkempt
wanderer
with
ghastly
white
face
and
fierce
wild
eyes
the
spruce
young
hunter
of
former
days
having
however
at
last
satisfied
himself
as
to
his
identity
the
man
surprise
changed
to
consternation
you
are
mad
to
come
here
he
cried
it
is
as
much
as
my
own
life
is
worth
to
be
seen
talking
with
you
there
is
warrant
against
you
from
the
holy
four
for
assisting
the
ferriers
away
don
fear
them
or
their
warrant
hope
said
earnestly
you
must
know
something
of
this
matter
cowper
conjure
you
by
everything
you
hold
dear
to
answer
few
questions
we
have
always
been
friends
for
god
sake
don
refuse
to
answer
me
what
is
it
the
mormon
asked
uneasily
be
quick
the
very
rocks
have
ears
and
the
trees
eyes
what
has
become
of
lucy
ferrier
she
was
married
yesterday
to
young
drebber
hold
up
man
hold
up
you
have
no
life
left
in
you
don
mind
me
said
hope
faintly
he
was
white
to
the
very
lips
and
had
sunk
down
on
the
stone
against
which
he
had
been
leaning
married
you
say
married
yesterday
that
what
those
flags
are
for
on
the
endowment
house
there
was
some
words
between
young
drebber
and
young
stangerson
as
to
which
was
to
have
her
they
both
been
in
the
party
that
followed
them
and
stangerson
had
shot
her
father
which
seemed
to
give
him
the
best
claim
but
when
they
argued
it
out
in
council
drebber
party
was
the
stronger
so
the
prophet
gave
her
over
to
him
no
one
won
have
her
very
long
though
for
saw
death
in
her
face
yesterday
she
is
more
like
ghost
than
woman
are
you
off
then
yes
am
off
said
jefferson
hope
who
had
risen
from
his
seat
his
face
might
have
been
chiselled
out
of
marble
so
hard
and
set
was
its
expression
while
its
eyes
glowed
with
baleful
light
where
are
you
going
never
mind
he
answered
and
slinging
his
weapon
over
his
shoulder
strode
off
down
the
gorge
and
so
away
into
the
heart
of
the
mountains
to
the
haunts
of
the
wild
beasts
amongst
them
all
there
was
none
so
fierce
and
so
dangerous
as
himself
the
prediction
of
the
mormon
was
only
too
well
fulfilled
whether
it
was
the
terrible
death
of
her
father
or
the
effects
of
the
hateful
marriage
into
which
she
had
been
forced
poor
lucy
never
held
up
her
head
again
but
pined
away
and
died
within
month
her
sottish
husband
who
had
married
her
principally
for
the
sake
of
john
ferrier
property
did
not
affect
any
great
grief
at
his
bereavement
but
his
other
wives
mourned
over
her
and
sat
up
with
her
the
night
before
the
burial
as
is
the
mormon
custom
they
were
grouped
round
the
bier
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
when
to
their
inexpressible
fear
and
astonishment
the
door
was
flung
open
and
savage
looking
weather
beaten
man
in
tattered
garments
strode
into
the
room
without
glance
or
word
to
the
cowering
women
he
walked
up
to
the
white
silent
figure
which
had
once
contained
the
pure
soul
of
lucy
ferrier
stooping
over
her
he
pressed
his
lips
reverently
to
her
cold
forehead
and
then
snatching
up
her
hand
he
took
the
wedding
ring
from
her
finger
she
shall
not
be
buried
in
that
he
cried
with
fierce
snarl
and
before
an
alarm
could
be
raised
sprang
down
the
stairs
and
was
gone
so
strange
and
so
brief
was
the
episode
that
the
watchers
might
have
found
it
hard
to
believe
it
themselves
or
persuade
other
people
of
it
had
it
not
been
for
the
undeniable
fact
that
the
circlet
of
gold
which
marked
her
as
having
been
bride
had
disappeared
for
some
months
jefferson
hope
lingered
among
the
mountains
leading
strange
wild
life
and
nursing
in
his
heart
the
fierce
desire
for
vengeance
which
possessed
him
tales
were
told
in
the
city
of
the
weird
figure
which
was
seen
prowling
about
the
suburbs
and
which
haunted
the
lonely
mountain
gorges
once
bullet
whistled
through
stangerson
window
and
flattened
itself
upon
the
wall
within
foot
of
him
on
another
occasion
as
drebber
passed
under
cliff
great
boulder
crashed
down
on
him
and
he
only
escaped
terrible
death
by
throwing
himself
upon
his
face
the
two
young
mormons
were
not
long
in
discovering
the
reason
of
these
attempts
upon
their
lives
and
led
repeated
expeditions
into
the
mountains
in
the
hope
of
capturing
or
killing
their
enemy
but
always
without
success
then
they
adopted
the
precaution
of
never
going
out
alone
or
after
nightfall
and
of
having
their
houses
guarded
after
time
they
were
able
to
relax
these
measures
for
nothing
was
either
heard
or
seen
of
their
opponent
and
they
hoped
that
time
had
cooled
his
vindictiveness
far
from
doing
so
it
had
if
anything
augmented
it
the
hunter
mind
was
of
hard
unyielding
nature
and
the
predominant
idea
of
revenge
had
taken
such
complete
possession
of
it
that
there
was
no
room
for
any
other
emotion
he
was
however
above
all
things
practical
he
soon
realized
that
even
his
iron
constitution
could
not
stand
the
incessant
strain
which
he
was
putting
upon
it
exposure
and
want
of
wholesome
food
were
wearing
him
out
if
he
died
like
dog
among
the
mountains
what
was
to
become
of
his
revenge
then
and
yet
such
death
was
sure
to
overtake
him
if
he
persisted
he
felt
that
was
to
play
his
enemy
game
so
he
reluctantly
returned
to
the
old
nevada
mines
there
to
recruit
his
health
and
to
amass
money
enough
to
allow
him
to
pursue
his
object
without
privation

his
intention
had
been
to
be
absent
year
at
the
most
but
combination
of
unforeseen
circumstances
prevented
his
leaving
the
mines
for
nearly
five
at
the
end
of
that
time
however
his
memory
of
his
wrongs
and
his
craving
for
revenge
were
quite
as
keen
as
on
that
memorable
night
when
he
had
stood
by
john
ferrier
grave
disguised
and
under
an
assumed
name
he
returned
to
salt
lake
city
careless
what
became
of
his
own
life
as
long
as
he
obtained
what
he
knew
to
be
justice
there
he
found
evil
tidings
awaiting
him
there
had
been
schism
among
the
chosen
people
few
months
before
some
of
the
younger
members
of
the
church
having
rebelled
against
the
authority
of
the
elders
and
the
result
had
been
the
secession
of
certain
number
of
the
malcontents
who
had
left
utah
and
become
gentiles
among
these
had
been
drebber
and
stangerson
and
no
one
knew
whither
they
had
gone
rumour
reported
that
drebber
had
managed
to
convert
large
part
of
his
property
into
money
and
that
he
had
departed
wealthy
man
while
his
companion
stangerson
was
comparatively
poor
there
was
no
clue
at
all
however
as
to
their
whereabouts
many
man
however
vindictive
would
have
abandoned
all
thought
of
revenge
in
the
face
of
such
difficulty
but
jefferson
hope
never
faltered
for
moment
with
the
small
competence
he
possessed
eked
out
by
such
employment
as
he
could
pick
up
he
travelled
from
town
to
town
through
the
united
states
in
quest
of
his
enemies
year
passed
into
year
his
black
hair
turned
grizzled
but
still
he
wandered
on
human
bloodhound
with
his
mind
wholly
set
upon
the
one
object
upon
which
he
had
devoted
his
life
at
last
his
perseverance
was
rewarded
it
was
but
glance
of
face
in
window
but
that
one
glance
told
him
that
cleveland
in
ohio
possessed
the
men
whom
he
was
in
pursuit
of
he
returned
to
his
miserable
lodgings
with
his
plan
of
vengeance
all
arranged
it
chanced
however
that
drebber
looking
from
his
window
had
recognized
the
vagrant
in
the
street
and
had
read
murder
in
his
eyes
he
hurried
before
justice
of
the
peace
accompanied
by
stangerson
who
had
become
his
private
secretary
and
represented
to
him
that
they
were
in
danger
of
their
lives
from
the
jealousy
and
hatred
of
an
old
rival
that
evening
jefferson
hope
was
taken
into
custody
and
not
being
able
to
find
sureties
was
detained
for
some
weeks
when
at
last
he
was
liberated
it
was
only
to
find
that
drebber
house
was
deserted
and
that
he
and
his
secretary
had
departed
for
europe
again
the
avenger
had
been
foiled
and
again
his
concentrated
hatred
urged
him
to
continue
the
pursuit
funds
were
wanting
however
and
for
some
time
he
had
to
return
to
work
saving
every
dollar
for
his
approaching
journey
at
last
having
collected
enough
to
keep
life
in
him
he
departed
for
europe
and
tracked
his
enemies
from
city
to
city
working
his
way
in
any
menial
capacity
but
never
overtaking
the
fugitives
when
he
reached
st
petersburg
they
had
departed
for
paris
and
when
he
followed
them
there
he
learned
that
they
had
just
set
off
for
copenhagen
at
the
danish
capital
he
was
again
few
days
late
for
they
had
journeyed
on
to
london
where
he
at
last
succeeded
in
running
them
to
earth
as
to
what
occurred
there
we
cannot
do
better
than
quote
the
old
hunter
own
account
as
duly
recorded
in
dr
watson
journal
to
which
we
are
already
under
such
obligations
vi
continuation
of
the
reminiscences
of
john
watson
our
prisoner
furious
resistance
did
not
apparently
indicate
any
ferocity
in
his
disposition
towards
ourselves
for
on
finding
himself
powerless
he
smiled
in
an
affable
manner
and
expressed
his
hopes
that
he
had
not
hurt
any
of
us
in
the
scuffle
guess
you
re
going
to
take
me
to
the
police
station
he
remarked
to
sherlock
holmes
my
cab
at
the
door
if
you
ll
loose
my
legs
ll
walk
down
to
it
not
so
light
to
lift
as
used
to
be
gregson
and
lestrade
exchanged
glances
as
if
they
thought
this
proposition
rather
bold
one
but
holmes
at
once
took
the
prisoner
at
his
word
and
loosened
the
towel
which
we
had
bound
round
his
ankles
he
rose
and
stretched
his
legs
as
though
to
assure
himself
that
they
were
free
once
more
remember
that
thought
to
myself
as
eyed
him
that
had
seldom
seen
more
powerfully
built
man
and
his
dark
sunburned
face
bore
an
expression
of
determination
and
energy
which
was
as
formidable
as
his
personal
strength
if
there
vacant
place
for
chief
of
the
police
reckon
you
are
the
man
for
it
he
said
gazing
with
undisguised
admiration
at
my
fellow
lodger
the
way
you
kept
on
my
trail
was
caution
you
had
better
come
with
me
said
holmes
to
the
two
detectives
can
drive
you
said
lestrade
good
and
gregson
can
come
inside
with
me
you
too
doctor
you
have
taken
an
interest
in
the
case
and
may
as
well
stick
to
us
assented
gladly
and
we
all
descended
together
our
prisoner
made
no
attempt
at
escape
but
stepped
calmly
into
the
cab
which
had
been
his
and
we
followed
him
lestrade
mounted
the
box
whipped
up
the
horse
and
brought
us
in
very
short
time
to
our
destination
we
were
ushered
into
small
chamber
where
police
inspector
noted
down
our
prisoner
name
and
the
names
of
the
men
with
whose
murder
he
had
been
charged
the
official
was
white
faced
unemotional
man
who
went
through
his
duties
in
dull
mechanical
way
the
prisoner
will
be
put
before
the
magistrates
in
the
course
of
the
week
he
said
in
the
mean
time
mr
jefferson
hope
have
you
anything
that
you
wish
to
say
must
warn
you
that
your
words
will
be
taken
down
and
may
be
used
against
you
ve
got
good
deal
to
say
our
prisoner
said
slowly
want
to
tell
you
gentlemen
all
about
it
hadn
you
better
reserve
that
for
your
trial
asked
the
inspector
may
never
be
tried
he
answered
you
needn
look
startled
it
isn
suicide
am
thinking
of
are
you
doctor
he
turned
his
fierce
dark
eyes
upon
me
as
he
asked
this
last
question
yes
am
answered
then
put
your
hand
here
he
said
with
smile
motioning
with
his
manacled
wrists
towards
his
chest
did
so
and
became
at
once
conscious
of
an
extraordinary
throbbing
and
commotion
which
was
going
on
inside
the
walls
of
his
chest
seemed
to
thrill
and
quiver
as
frail
building
would
do
inside
when
some
powerful
engine
was
at
work
in
the
silence
of
the
room
could
hear
dull
humming
and
buzzing
noise
which
proceeded
from
the
same
source
why
cried
you
have
an
aortic
aneurism
that
what
they
call
it
he
said
placidly
went
to
doctor
last
week
about
it
and
he
told
me
that
it
is
bound
to
burst
before
many
days
passed
it
has
been
getting
worse
for
years
got
it
from
over
exposure
and
under
feeding
among
the
salt
lake
mountains
ve
done
my
work
now
and
don
care
how
soon
go
but
should
like
to
leave
some
account
of
the
business
behind
me
don
want
to
be
remembered
as
common
cut
throat
the
inspector
and
the
two
detectives
had
hurried
discussion
as
to
the
advisability
of
allowing
him
to
tell
his
story
do
you
consider
doctor
that
there
is
immediate
danger
the
former
asked
most
certainly
there
is
answered
in
that
case
it
is
clearly
our
duty
in
the
interests
of
justice
to
take
his
statement
said
the
inspector
you
are
at
liberty
sir
to
give
your
account
which
again
warn
you
will
be
taken
down
ll
sit
down
with
your
leave
the
prisoner
said
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
this
aneurism
of
mine
makes
me
easily
tired
and
the
tussle
we
had
half
an
hour
ago
has
not
mended
matters
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
and
am
not
likely
to
lie
to
you
every
word
say
is
the
absolute
truth
and
how
you
use
it
is
matter
of
no
consequence
to
me
with
these
words
jefferson
hope
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
began
the
following
remarkable
statement
he
spoke
in
calm
and
methodical
manner
as
though
the
events
which
he
narrated
were
commonplace
enough
can
vouch
for
the
accuracy
of
the
subjoined
account
for
have
had
access
to
lestrade
note
book
in
which
the
prisoner
words
were
taken
down
exactly
as
they
were
uttered
it
don
much
matter
to
you
why
hated
these
men
he
said
it
enough
that
they
were
guilty
of
the
death
of
two
human
beings
father
and
daughter
and
that
they
had
therefore
forfeited
their
own
lives
after
the
lapse
of
time
that
has
passed
since
their
crime
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
secure
conviction
against
them
in
any
court
knew
of
their
guilt
though
and
determined
that
should
be
judge
jury
and
executioner
all
rolled
into
one
you
have
done
the
same
if
you
have
any
manhood
in
you
if
you
had
been
in
my
place
that
girl
that
spoke
of
was
to
have
married
me
twenty
years
ago
she
was
forced
into
marrying
that
same
drebber
and
broke
her
heart
over
it
took
the
marriage
ring
from
her
dead
finger
and
vowed
that
his
dying
eyes
should
rest
upon
that
very
ring
and
that
his
last
thoughts
should
be
of
the
crime
for
which
he
was
punished
have
carried
it
about
with
me
and
have
followed
him
and
his
accomplice
over
two
continents
until
caught
them
they
thought
to
tire
me
out
but
they
could
not
do
it
if
die
to
morrow
as
is
likely
enough
die
knowing
that
my
work
in
this
world
is
done
and
well
done
they
have
perished
and
by
my
hand
there
is
nothing
left
for
me
to
hope
for
or
to
desire

they
were
rich
and
was
poor
so
that
it
was
no
easy
matter
for
me
to
follow
them
when
got
to
london
my
pocket
was
about
empty
and
found
that
must
turn
my
hand
to
something
for
my
living
driving
and
riding
are
as
natural
to
me
as
walking
so
applied
at
cabowner
office
and
soon
got
employment
was
to
bring
certain
sum
week
to
the
owner
and
whatever
was
over
that
might
keep
for
myself
there
was
seldom
much
over
but
managed
to
scrape
along
somehow
the
hardest
job
was
to
learn
my
way
about
for
reckon
that
of
all
the
mazes
that
ever
were
contrived
this
city
is
the
most
confusing
had
map
beside
me
though
and
when
once
had
spotted
the
principal
hotels
and
stations
got
on
pretty
well
it
was
some
time
before
found
out
where
my
two
gentlemen
were
living
but
inquired
and
inquired
until
at
last
dropped
across
them
they
were
at
boarding
house
at
camberwell
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
when
once
found
them
out
knew
that
had
them
at
my
mercy
had
grown
my
beard
and
there
was
no
chance
of
their
recognizing
me
would
dog
them
and
follow
them
until
saw
my
opportunity
was
determined
that
they
should
not
escape
me
again
they
were
very
near
doing
it
for
all
that
go
where
they
would
about
london
was
always
at
their
heels
sometimes
followed
them
on
my
cab
and
sometimes
on
foot
but
the
former
was
the
best
for
then
they
could
not
get
away
from
me
it
was
only
early
in
the
morning
or
late
at
night
that
could
earn
anything
so
that
began
to
get
behindhand
with
my
employer
did
not
mind
that
however
as
long
as
could
lay
my
hand
upon
the
men
wanted
they
were
very
cunning
though
they
must
have
thought
that
there
was
some
chance
of
their
being
followed
for
they
would
never
go
out
alone
and
never
after
nightfall
during
two
weeks
drove
behind
them
every
day
and
never
once
saw
them
separate
drebber
himself
was
drunk
half
the
time
but
stangerson
was
not
to
be
caught
napping
watched
them
late
and
early
but
never
saw
the
ghost
of
chance
but
was
not
discouraged
for
something
told
me
that
the
hour
had
almost
come
my
only
fear
was
that
this
thing
in
my
chest
might
burst
little
too
soon
and
leave
my
work
undone
at
last
one
evening
was
driving
up
and
down
torquay
terrace
as
the
street
was
called
in
which
they
boarded
when
saw
cab
drive
up
to
their
door
presently
some
luggage
was
brought
out
and
after
time
drebber
and
stangerson
followed
it
and
drove
off
whipped
up
my
horse
and
kept
within
sight
of
them
feeling
very
ill
at
ease
for
feared
that
they
were
going
to
shift
their
quarters
at
euston
station
they
got
out
and
left
boy
to
hold
my
horse
and
followed
them
on
to
the
platform
heard
them
ask
for
the
liverpool
train
and
the
guard
answer
that
one
had
just
gone
and
there
would
not
be
another
for
some
hours
stangerson
seemed
to
be
put
out
at
that
but
drebber
was
rather
pleased
than
otherwise
got
so
close
to
them
in
the
bustle
that
could
hear
every
word
that
passed
between
them
drebber
said
that
he
had
little
business
of
his
own
to
do
and
that
if
the
other
would
wait
for
him
he
would
soon
rejoin
him
his
companion
remonstrated
with
him
and
reminded
him
that
they
had
resolved
to
stick
together
drebber
answered
that
the
matter
was
delicate
one
and
that
he
must
go
alone
could
not
catch
what
stangerson
said
to
that
but
the
other
burst
out
swearing
and
reminded
him
that
he
was
nothing
more
than
his
paid
servant
and
that
he
must
not
presume
to
dictate
to
him
on
that
the
secretary
gave
it
up
as
bad
job
and
simply
bargained
with
him
that
if
he
missed
the
last
train
he
should
rejoin
him
at
halliday
private
hotel
to
which
drebber
answered
that
he
would
be
back
on
the
platform
before
eleven
and
made
his
way
out
of
the
station
the
moment
for
which
had
waited
so
long
had
at
last
come
had
my
enemies
within
my
power
together
they
could
protect
each
other
but
singly
they
were
at
my
mercy
did
not
act
however
with
undue
precipitation
my
plans
were
already
formed
there
is
no
satisfaction
in
vengeance
unless
the
offender
has
time
to
realize
who
it
is
that
strikes
him
and
why
retribution
has
come
upon
him
had
my
plans
arranged
by
which
should
have
the
opportunity
of
making
the
man
who
had
wronged
me
understand
that
his
old
sin
had
found
him
out
it
chanced
that
some
days
before
gentleman
who
had
been
engaged
in
looking
over
some
houses
in
the
brixton
road
had
dropped
the
key
of
one
of
them
in
my
carriage
it
was
claimed
that
same
evening
and
returned
but
in
the
interval
had
taken
moulding
of
it
and
had
duplicate
constructed
by
means
of
this
had
access
to
at
least
one
spot
in
this
great
city
where
could
rely
upon
being
free
from
interruption
how
to
get
drebber
to
that
house
was
the
difficult
problem
which
had
now
to
solve
he
walked
down
the
road
and
went
into
one
or
two
liquor
shops
staying
for
nearly
half
an
hour
in
the
last
of
them
when
he
came
out
he
staggered
in
his
walk
and
was
evidently
pretty
well
on
there
was
hansom
just
in
front
of
me
and
he
hailed
it
followed
it
so
close
that
the
nose
of
my
horse
was
within
yard
of
his
driver
the
whole
way
we
rattled
across
waterloo
bridge
and
through
miles
of
streets
until
to
my
astonishment
we
found
ourselves
back
in
the
terrace
in
which
he
had
boarded
could
not
imagine
what
his
intention
was
in
returning
there
but
went
on
and
pulled
up
my
cab
hundred
yards
or
so
from
the
house
he
entered
it
and
his
hansom
drove
away
give
me
glass
of
water
if
you
please
my
mouth
gets
dry
with
the
talking
handed
him
the
glass
and
he
drank
it
down
that
better
he
said
well
waited
for
quarter
of
an
hour
or
more
when
suddenly
there
came
noise
like
people
struggling
inside
the
house
next
moment
the
door
was
flung
open
and
two
men
appeared
one
of
whom
was
drebber
and
the
other
was
young
chap
whom
had
never
seen
before
this
fellow
had
drebber
by
the
collar
and
when
they
came
to
the
head
of
the
steps
he
gave
him
shove
and
kick
which
sent
him
half
across
the
road
you
hound
he
cried
shaking
his
stick
at
him
ll
teach
you
to
insult
an
honest
girl
he
was
so
hot
that
think
he
would
have
thrashed
drebber
with
his
cudgel
only
that
the
cur
staggered
away
down
the
road
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
he
ran
as
far
as
the
corner
and
then
seeing
my
cab
he
hailed
me
and
jumped
in
drive
me
to
halliday
private
hotel
said
he
when
had
him
fairly
inside
my
cab
my
heart
jumped
so
with
joy
that
feared
lest
at
this
last
moment
my
aneurism
might
go
wrong
drove
along
slowly
weighing
in
my
own
mind
what
it
was
best
to
do
might
take
him
right
out
into
the
country
and
there
in
some
deserted
lane
have
my
last
interview
with
him
had
almost
decided
upon
this
when
he
solved
the
problem
for
me
the
craze
for
drink
had
seized
him
again
and
he
ordered
me
to
pull
up
outside
gin
palace
he
went
in
leaving
word
that
should
wait
for
him
there
he
remained
until
closing
time
and
when
he
came
out
he
was
so
far
gone
that
knew
the
game
was
in
my
own
hands
don
imagine
that
intended
to
kill
him
in
cold
blood
it
would
only
have
been
rigid
justice
if
had
done
so
but
could
not
bring
myself
to
do
it
had
long
determined
that
he
should
have
show
for
his
life
if
he
chose
to
take
advantage
of
it
among
the
many
billets
which
have
filled
in
america
during
my
wandering
life
was
once
janitor
and
sweeper
out
of
the
laboratory
at
york
college
one
day
the
professor
was
lecturing
on
poisons
and
he
showed
his
students
some
alkaloid
as
he
called
it
which
he
had
extracted
from
some
south
american
arrow
poison
and
which
was
so
powerful
that
the
least
grain
meant
instant
death
spotted
the
bottle
in
which
this
preparation
was
kept
and
when
they
were
all
gone
helped
myself
to
little
of
it
was
fairly
good
dispenser
so
worked
this
alkaloid
into
small
soluble
pills
and
each
pill
put
in
box
with
similar
pill
made
without
the
poison
determined
at
the
time
that
when
had
my
chance
my
gentlemen
should
each
have
draw
out
of
one
of
these
boxes
while
ate
the
pill
that
remained
it
would
be
quite
as
deadly
and
good
deal
less
noisy
than
firing
across
handkerchief
from
that
day
had
always
my
pill
boxes
about
with
me
and
the
time
had
now
come
when
was
to
use
them
it
was
nearer
one
than
twelve
and
wild
bleak
night
blowing
hard
and
raining
in
torrents
dismal
as
it
was
outside
was
glad
within
so
glad
that
could
have
shouted
out
from
pure
exultation
if
any
of
you
gentlemen
have
ever
pined
for
thing
and
longed
for
it
during
twenty
long
years
and
then
suddenly
found
it
within
your
reach
you
would
understand
my
feelings
lit
cigar
and
puffed
at
it
to
steady
my
nerves
but
my
hands
were
trembling
and
my
temples
throbbing
with
excitement
as
drove
could
see
old
john
ferrier
and
sweet
lucy
looking
at
me
out
of
the
darkness
and
smiling
at
me
just
as
plain
as
see
you
all
in
this
room
all
the
way
they
were
ahead
of
me
one
on
each
side
of
the
horse
until
pulled
up
at
the
house
in
the
brixton
road

there
was
not
soul
to
be
seen
nor
sound
to
be
heard
except
the
dripping
of
the
rain
when
looked
in
at
the
window
found
drebber
all
huddled
together
in
drunken
sleep
shook
him
by
the
arm
it
time
to
get
out
said
all
right
cabby
said
he
suppose
he
thought
we
had
come
to
the
hotel
that
he
had
mentioned
for
he
got
out
without
another
word
and
followed
me
down
the
garden
had
to
walk
beside
him
to
keep
him
steady
for
he
was
still
little
top
heavy
when
we
came
to
the
door
opened
it
and
led
him
into
the
front
room
give
you
my
word
that
all
the
way
the
father
and
the
daughter
were
walking
in
front
of
us
it
infernally
dark
said
he
stamping
about
we
ll
soon
have
light
said
striking
match
and
putting
it
to
wax
candle
which
had
brought
with
me
now
enoch
drebber
continued
turning
to
him
and
holding
the
light
to
my
own
face
who
am
he
gazed
at
me
with
bleared
drunken
eyes
for
moment
and
then
saw
horror
spring
up
in
them
and
convulse
his
whole
features
which
showed
me
that
he
knew
me
he
staggered
back
with
livid
face
and
saw
the
perspiration
break
out
upon
his
brow
while
his
teeth
chattered
in
his
head
at
the
sight
leaned
my
back
against
the
door
and
laughed
loud
and
long
had
always
known
that
vengeance
would
be
sweet
but
had
never
hoped
for
the
contentment
of
soul
which
now
possessed
me
you
dog
said
have
hunted
you
from
salt
lake
city
to
st
petersburg
and
you
have
always
escaped
me
now
at
last
your
wanderings
have
come
to
an
end
for
either
you
or
shall
never
see
to
morrow
sun
rise
he
shrunk
still
further
away
as
spoke
and
could
see
on
his
face
that
he
thought
was
mad
so
was
for
the
time
the
pulses
in
my
temples
beat
like
sledge
hammers
and
believe
would
have
had
fit
of
some
sort
if
the
blood
had
not
gushed
from
my
nose
and
relieved
me
what
do
you
think
of
lucy
ferrier
now
cried
locking
the
door
and
shaking
the
key
in
his
face
punishment
has
been
slow
in
coming
but
it
has
overtaken
you
at
last
saw
his
coward
lips
tremble
as
spoke
he
would
have
begged
for
his
life
but
he
knew
well
that
it
was
useless
would
you
murder
me
he
stammered
there
is
no
murder
answered
who
talks
of
murdering
mad
dog
what
mercy
had
you
upon
my
poor
darling
when
you
dragged
her
from
her
slaughtered
father
and
bore
her
away
to
your
accursed
and
shameless
harem
it
was
not
who
killed
her
father
he
cried
but
it
was
you
who
broke
her
innocent
heart
shrieked
thrusting
the
box
before
him
let
the
high
god
judge
between
us
choose
and
eat
there
is
death
in
one
and
life
in
the
other
shall
take
what
you
leave
let
us
see
if
there
is
justice
upon
the
earth
or
if
we
are
ruled
by
chance
he
cowered
away
with
wild
cries
and
prayers
for
mercy
but
drew
my
knife
and
held
it
to
his
throat
until
he
had
obeyed
me
then
swallowed
the
other
and
we
stood
facing
one
another
in
silence
for
minute
or
more
waiting
to
see
which
was
to
live
and
which
was
to
die
shall
ever
forget
the
look
which
came
over
his
face
when
the
first
warning
pangs
told
him
that
the
poison
was
in
his
system
laughed
as
saw
it
and
held
lucy
marriage
ring
in
front
of
his
eyes
it
was
but
for
moment
for
the
action
of
the
alkaloid
is
rapid
spasm
of
pain
contorted
his
features
he
threw
his
hands
out
in
front
of
him
staggered
and
then
with
hoarse
cry
fell
heavily
upon
the
floor
turned
him
over
with
my
foot
and
placed
my
hand
upon
his
heart
there
was
no
movement
he
was
dead
the
blood
had
been
streaming
from
my
nose
but
had
taken
no
notice
of
it
don
know
what
it
was
that
put
it
into
my
head
to
write
upon
the
wall
with
it
perhaps
it
was
some
mischievous
idea
of
setting
the
police
upon
wrong
track
for
felt
light
hearted
and
cheerful
remembered
german
being
found
in
new
york
with
rache
written
up
above
him
and
it
was
argued
at
the
time
in
the
newspapers
that
the
secret
societies
must
have
done
it
guessed
that
what
puzzled
the
new
yorkers
would
puzzle
the
londoners
so
dipped
my
finger
in
my
own
blood
and
printed
it
on
convenient
place
on
the
wall
then
walked
down
to
my
cab
and
found
that
there
was
nobody
about
and
that
the
night
was
still
very
wild
had
driven
some
distance
when
put
my
hand
into
the
pocket
in
which
usually
kept
lucy
ring
and
found
that
it
was
not
there
was
thunderstruck
at
this
for
it
was
the
only
memento
that
had
of
her
thinking
that
might
have
dropped
it
when
stooped
over
drebber
body
drove
back
and
leaving
my
cab
in
side
street
went
boldly
up
to
the
house
for
was
ready
to
dare
anything
rather
than
lose
the
ring
when
arrived
there
walked
right
into
the
arms
of
police
officer
who
was
coming
out
and
only
managed
to
disarm
his
suspicions
by
pretending
to
be
hopelessly
drunk
that
was
how
enoch
drebber
came
to
his
end
all
had
to
do
then
was
to
do
as
much
for
stangerson
and
so
pay
off
john
ferrier
debt
knew
that
he
was
staying
at
halliday
private
hotel
and
hung
about
all
day
but
he
never
came
out
fancy
that
he
suspected
something
when
drebber
failed
to
put
in
an
appearance
he
was
cunning
was
stangerson
and
always
on
his
guard
if
he
thought
he
could
keep
me
off
by
staying
indoors
he
was
very
much
mistaken
soon
found
out
which
was
the
window
of
his
bedroom
and
early
next
morning
took
advantage
of
some
ladders
which
were
lying
in
the
lane
behind
the
hotel
and
so
made
my
way
into
his
room
in
the
grey
of
the
dawn
woke
him
up
and
told
him
that
the
hour
had
come
when
he
was
to
answer
for
the
life
he
had
taken
so
long
before
described
drebber
death
to
him
and
gave
him
the
same
choice
of
the
poisoned
pills
instead
of
grasping
at
the
chance
of
safety
which
that
offered
him
he
sprang
from
his
bed
and
flew
at
my
throat
in
self
defence
stabbed
him
to
the
heart
it
would
have
been
the
same
in
any
case
for
providence
would
never
have
allowed
his
guilty
hand
to
pick
out
anything
but
the
poison
have
little
more
to
say
and
it
as
well
for
am
about
done
up
went
on
cabbing
it
for
day
or
so
intending
to
keep
at
it
until
could
save
enough
to
take
me
back
to
america
was
standing
in
the
yard
when
ragged
youngster
asked
if
there
was
cabby
there
called
jefferson
hope
and
said
that
his
cab
was
wanted
by
gentleman
at
221B
baker
street
went
round
suspecting
no
harm
and
the
next
thing
knew
this
young
man
here
had
the
bracelets
on
my
wrists
and
as
neatly
snackled
as
ever
saw
in
my
life
that
the
whole
of
my
story
gentlemen
you
may
consider
me
to
be
murderer
but
hold
that
am
just
as
much
an
officer
of
justice
as
you
are
so
thrilling
had
the
man
narrative
been
and
his
manner
was
so
impressive
that
we
had
sat
silent
and
absorbed
even
the
professional
detectives
blasé
as
they
were
in
every
detail
of
crime
appeared
to
be
keenly
interested
in
the
man
story
when
he
finished
we
sat
for
some
minutes
in
stillness
which
was
only
broken
by
the
scratching
of
lestrade
pencil
as
he
gave
the
finishing
touches
to
his
shorthand
account
there
is
only
one
point
on
which
should
like
little
more
information
sherlock
holmes
said
at
last
who
was
your
accomplice
who
came
for
the
ring
which
advertised
the
prisoner
winked
at
my
friend
jocosely
can
tell
my
own
secrets
he
said
but
don
get
other
people
into
trouble
saw
your
advertisement
and
thought
it
might
be
plant
or
it
might
be
the
ring
which
wanted
my
friend
volunteered
to
go
and
see
think
you
ll
own
he
did
it
smartly
not
doubt
of
that
said
holmes
heartily
now
gentlemen
the
inspector
remarked
gravely
the
forms
of
the
law
must
be
complied
with
on
thursday
the
prisoner
will
be
brought
before
the
magistrates
and
your
attendance
will
be
required
until
then
will
be
responsible
for
him
he
rang
the
bell
as
he
spoke
and
jefferson
hope
was
led
off
by
couple
of
warders
while
my
friend
and
made
our
way
out
of
the
station
and
took
cab
back
to
baker
street
vii
the
conclusion
we
had
all
been
warned
to
appear
before
the
magistrates
upon
the
thursday
but
when
the
thursday
came
there
was
no
occasion
for
our
testimony
higher
judge
had
taken
the
matter
in
hand
and
jefferson
hope
had
been
summoned
before
tribunal
where
strict
justice
would
be
meted
out
to
him
on
the
very
night
after
his
capture
the
aneurism
burst
and
he
was
found
in
the
morning
stretched
upon
the
floor
of
the
cell
with
placid
smile
upon
his
face
as
though
he
had
been
able
in
his
dying
moments
to
look
back
upon
useful
life
and
on
work
well
done
gregson
and
lestrade
will
be
wild
about
his
death
holmes
remarked
as
we
chatted
it
over
next
evening
where
will
their
grand
advertisement
be
now
don
see
that
they
had
very
much
to
do
with
his
capture
answered
what
you
do
in
this
world
is
matter
of
no
consequence
returned
my
companion
bitterly
the
question
is
what
can
you
make
people
believe
that
you
have
done
never
mind
he
continued
more
brightly
after
pause
would
not
have
missed
the
investigation
for
anything
there
has
been
no
better
case
within
my
recollection
simple
as
it
was
there
were
several
most
instructive
points
about
it

simple
ejaculated
well
really
it
can
hardly
be
described
as
otherwise
said
sherlock
holmes
smiling
at
my
surprise
the
proof
of
its
intrinsic
simplicity
is
that
without
any
help
save
few
very
ordinary
deductions
was
able
to
lay
my
hand
upon
the
criminal
within
three
days
that
is
true
said
have
already
explained
to
you
that
what
is
out
of
the
common
is
usually
guide
rather
than
hindrance
in
solving
problem
of
this
sort
the
grand
thing
is
to
be
able
to
reason
backwards
that
is
very
useful
accomplishment
and
very
easy
one
but
people
do
not
practise
it
much
in
the
every
day
affairs
of
life
it
is
more
useful
to
reason
forwards
and
so
the
other
comes
to
be
neglected
there
are
fifty
who
can
reason
synthetically
for
one
who
can
reason
analytically
confess
said
that
do
not
quite
follow
you
hardly
expected
that
you
would
let
me
see
if
can
make
it
clearer
most
people
if
you
describe
train
of
events
to
them
will
tell
you
what
the
result
would
be
they
can
put
those
events
together
in
their
minds
and
argue
from
them
that
something
will
come
to
pass
there
are
few
people
however
who
if
you
told
them
result
would
be
able
to
evolve
from
their
own
inner
consciousness
what
the
steps
were
which
led
up
to
that
result
this
power
is
what
mean
when
talk
of
reasoning
backwards
or
analytically
understand
said
now
this
was
case
in
which
you
were
given
the
result
and
had
to
find
everything
else
for
yourself
now
let
me
endeavour
to
show
you
the
different
steps
in
my
reasoning
to
begin
at
the
beginning
approached
the
house
as
you
know
on
foot
and
with
my
mind
entirely
free
from
all
impressions
naturally
began
by
examining
the
roadway
and
there
as
have
already
explained
to
you
saw
clearly
the
marks
of
cab
which
ascertained
by
inquiry
must
have
been
there
during
the
night
satisfied
myself
that
it
was
cab
and
not
private
carriage
by
the
narrow
gauge
of
the
wheels
the
ordinary
london
growler
is
considerably
less
wide
than
gentleman
brougham
this
was
the
first
point
gained
then
walked
slowly
down
the
garden
path
which
happened
to
be
composed
of
clay
soil
peculiarly
suitable
for
taking
impressions
no
doubt
it
appeared
to
you
to
be
mere
trampled
line
of
slush
but
to
my
trained
eyes
every
mark
upon
its
surface
had
meaning
there
is
no
branch
of
detective
science
which
is
so
important
and
so
much
neglected
as
the
art
of
tracing
footsteps
happily
have
always
laid
great
stress
upon
it
and
much
practice
has
made
it
second
nature
to
me
saw
the
heavy
footmarks
of
the
constables
but
saw
also
the
track
of
the
two
men
who
had
first
passed
through
the
garden
it
was
easy
to
tell
that
they
had
been
before
the
others
because
in
places
their
marks
had
been
entirely
obliterated
by
the
others
coming
upon
the
top
of
them
in
this
way
my
second
link
was
formed
which
told
me
that
the
nocturnal
visitors
were
two
in
number
one
remarkable
for
his
height
as
calculated
from
the
length
of
his
stride
and
the
other
fashionably
dressed
to
judge
from
the
small
and
elegant
impression
left
by
his
boots
on
entering
the
house
this
last
inference
was
confirmed
my
well
booted
man
lay
before
me
the
tall
one
then
had
done
the
murder
if
murder
there
was
there
was
no
wound
upon
the
dead
man
person
but
the
agitated
expression
upon
his
face
assured
me
that
he
had
foreseen
his
fate
before
it
came
upon
him
men
who
die
from
heart
disease
or
any
sudden
natural
cause
never
by
any
chance
exhibit
agitation
upon
their
features
having
sniffed
the
dead
man
lips
detected
slightly
sour
smell
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
poison
forced
upon
him
again
argued
that
it
had
been
forced
upon
him
from
the
hatred
and
fear
expressed
upon
his
face
by
the
method
of
exclusion
had
arrived
at
this
result
for
no
other
hypothesis
would
meet
the
facts
do
not
imagine
that
it
was
very
unheard
of
idea
the
forcible
administration
of
poison
is
by
no
means
new
thing
in
criminal
annals
the
cases
of
dolsky
in
odessa
and
of
leturier
in
montpellier
will
occur
at
once
to
any
toxicologist
and
now
came
the
great
question
as
to
the
reason
why
robbery
had
not
been
the
object
of
the
murder
for
nothing
was
taken
was
it
politics
then
or
was
it
woman
that
was
the
question
which
confronted
me
was
inclined
from
the
first
to
the
latter
supposition
political
assassins
are
only
too
glad
to
do
their
work
and
to
fly
this
murder
had
on
the
contrary
been
done
most
deliberately
and
the
perpetrator
had
left
his
tracks
all
over
the
room
showing
that
he
had
been
there
all
the
time
it
must
have
been
private
wrong
and
not
political
one
which
called
for
such
methodical
revenge
when
the
inscription
was
discovered
upon
the
wall
was
more
inclined
than
ever
to
my
opinion
the
thing
was
too
evidently
blind
when
the
ring
was
found
however
it
settled
the
question
clearly
the
murderer
had
used
it
to
remind
his
victim
of
some
dead
or
absent
woman
it
was
at
this
point
that
asked
gregson
whether
he
had
enquired
in
his
telegram
to
cleveland
as
to
any
particular
point
in
mr
drebber
former
career
he
answered
you
remember
in
the
negative
then
proceeded
to
make
careful
examination
of
the
room
which
confirmed
me
in
my
opinion
as
to
the
murderer
height
and
furnished
me
with
the
additional
details
as
to
the
trichinopoly
cigar
and
the
length
of
his
nails
had
already
come
to
the
conclusion
since
there
were
no
signs
of
struggle
that
the
blood
which
covered
the
floor
had
burst
from
the
murderer
nose
in
his
excitement
could
perceive
that
the
track
of
blood
coincided
with
the
track
of
his
feet
it
is
seldom
that
any
man
unless
he
is
very
full
blooded
breaks
out
in
this
way
through
emotion
so
hazarded
the
opinion
that
the
criminal
was
probably
robust
and
ruddy
faced
man
events
proved
that
had
judged
correctly
having
left
the
house
proceeded
to
do
what
gregson
had
neglected
telegraphed
to
the
head
of
the
police
at
cleveland
limiting
my
enquiry
to
the
circumstances
connected
with
the
marriage
of
enoch
drebber
the
answer
was
conclusive
it
told
me
that
drebber
had
already
applied
for
the
protection
of
the
law
against
an
old
rival
in
love
named
jefferson
hope
and
that
this
same
hope
was
at
present
in
europe
knew
now
that
held
the
clue
to
the
mystery
in
my
hand
and
all
that
remained
was
to
secure
the
murderer
had
already
determined
in
my
own
mind
that
the
man
who
had
walked
into
the
house
with
drebber
was
none
other
than
the
man
who
had
driven
the
cab
the
marks
in
the
road
showed
me
that
the
horse
had
wandered
on
in
way
which
would
have
been
impossible
had
there
been
anyone
in
charge
of
it
where
then
could
the
driver
be
unless
he
were
inside
the
house
again
it
is
absurd
to
suppose
that
any
sane
man
would
carry
out
deliberate
crime
under
the
very
eyes
as
it
were
of
third
person
who
was
sure
to
betray
him
lastly
supposing
one
man
wished
to
dog
another
through
london
what
better
means
could
he
adopt
than
to
turn
cabdriver
all
these
considerations
led
me
to
the
irresistible
conclusion
that
jefferson
hope
was
to
be
found
among
the
jarveys
of
the
metropolis
if
he
had
been
one
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
ceased
to
be
on
the
contrary
from
his
point
of
view
any
sudden
chance
would
be
likely
to
draw
attention
to
himself
he
would
probably
for
time
at
least
continue
to
perform
his
duties
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
that
he
was
going
under
an
assumed
name
why
should
he
change
his
name
in
country
where
no
one
knew
his
original
one
therefore
organized
my
street
arab
detective
corps
and
sent
them
systematically
to
every
cab
proprietor
in
london
until
they
ferreted
out
the
man
that
wanted
how
well
they
succeeded
and
how
quickly
took
advantage
of
it
are
still
fresh
in
your
recollection
the
murder
of
stangerson
was
an
incident
which
was
entirely
unexpected
but
which
could
hardly
in
any
case
have
been
prevented
through
it
as
you
know
came
into
possession
of
the
pills
the
existence
of
which
had
already
surmised
you
see
the
whole
thing
is
chain
of
logical
sequences
without
break
or
flaw
it
is
wonderful
cried
your
merits
should
be
publicly
recognized
you
should
publish
an
account
of
the
case
if
you
won
will
for
you
may
do
what
you
like
doctor
he
answered
see
here
he
continued
handing
paper
over
to
me
look
at
this
it
was
the
echo
for
the
day
and
the
paragraph
to
which
he
pointed
was
devoted
to
the
case
in
question
the
public
it
said
have
lost
sensational
treat
through
the
sudden
death
of
the
man
hope
who
was
suspected
of
the
murder
of
mr
enoch
drebber
and
of
mr
joseph
stangerson
the
details
of
the
case
will
probably
be
never
known
now
though
we
are
informed
upon
good
authority
that
the
crime
was
the
result
of
an
old
standing
and
romantic
feud
in
which
love
and
mormonism
bore
part
it
seems
that
both
the
victims
belonged
in
their
younger
days
to
the
latter
day
saints
and
hope
the
deceased
prisoner
hails
also
from
salt
lake
city
if
the
case
has
had
no
other
effect
it
at
least
brings
out
in
the
most
striking
manner
the
efficiency
of
our
detective
police
force
and
will
serve
as
lesson
to
all
foreigners
that
they
will
do
wisely
to
settle
their
feuds
at
home
and
not
to
carry
them
on
to
british
soil
it
is
an
open
secret
that
the
credit
of
this
smart
capture
belongs
entirely
to
the
well
known
scotland
yard
officials
messrs
lestrade
and
gregson
the
man
was
apprehended
it
appears
in
the
rooms
of
certain
mr
sherlock
holmes
who
has
himself
as
an
amateur
shown
some
talent
in
the
detective
line
and
who
with
such
instructors
may
hope
in
time
to
attain
to
some
degree
of
their
skill
it
is
expected
that
testimonial
of
some
sort
will
be
presented
to
the
two
officers
as
fitting
recognition
of
their
services

the
science
of

sherlock
holmes
took
his
bottle
from
the
corner
of
the
mantelpiece
and
his
hypodermic
syringe
from
its
neat
morocco
case
with
his
long
white
nervous
fingers
he
adjusted
the
delicate
needle
and
rolled
back
his
left
shirtcuff
for
some
little
time
his
eyes
rested
thoughtfully
upon
the
sinewy
forearm
and
wrist
all
dotted
and
scarred
with
innumerable
puncture
marks
finally
he
thrust
the
sharp
point
home
pressed
down
the
tiny
piston
and
sank
back
into
the
velvet
lined
arm
chair
with
long
sigh
of
satisfaction
three
times
day
for
many
months
had
witnessed
this
performance
but
custom
had
not
reconciled
my
mind
to
it
on
the
contrary
from
day
to
day
had
become
more
irritable
at
the
sight
and
my
conscience
swelled
nightly
within
me
at
the
thought
that
had
lacked
the
courage
to
protest
again
and
again
had
registered
vow
that
should
deliver
my
soul
upon
the
subject
but
there
was
that
in
the
cool
nonchalant
air
of
my
companion
which
made
him
the
last
man
with
whom
one
would
care
to
take
anything
approaching
to
liberty
his
great
powers
his
masterly
manner
and
the
experience
which
had
of
his
many
extraordinary
qualities
all
made
me
diffident
and
backward
in
crossing
him
yet
upon
that
afternoon
whether
it
was
the
beaune
which
had
taken
with
my
lunch
or
the
additional
exasperation
produced
by
the
extreme
deliberation
of
his
manner
suddenly
felt
that
could
hold
out
no
longer
which
is
it
to
day
asked
morphine
or
cocaine
he
raised
his
eyes
languidly
from
the
old
black
letter
volume
which
he
had
opened
it
is
cocaine
he
said
seven
per
cent
solution
would
you
care
to
try
it
no
indeed
answered
brusquely
my
constitution
has
not
got
over
the
afghan
campaign
yet
cannot
afford
to
throw
any
extra
strain
upon
it
he
smiled
at
my
vehemence
perhaps
you
are
right
watson
he
said
suppose
that
its
influence
is
physically
bad
one
find
it
however
so
transcendently
stimulating
and
clarifying
to
the
mind
that
its
secondary
action
is
matter
of
small
moment
but
consider
said
earnestly
count
the
cost
your
brain
may
as
you
say
be
roused
and
excited
but
it
is
pathological
and
morbid
process
which
involves
increased
tissue
change
and
may
at
last
leave
permanent
weakness
you
know
too
what
black
reaction
comes
upon
you
surely
the
game
is
hardly
worth
the
candle
why
should
you
for
mere
passing
pleasure
risk
the
loss
of
those
great
powers
with
which
you
have
been
endowed
remember
that
speak
not
only
as
one
comrade
to
another
but
as
medical
man
to
one
for
whose
constitution
he
is
to
some
extent
answerable
he
did
not
seem
offended
on
the
contrary
he
put
his
finger
tips
together
and
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
arms
of
his
chair
like
one
who
has
relish
for
conversation
my
mind
he
said
rebels
at
stagnation
give
me
problems
give
me
work
give
me
the
most
abstruse
cryptogram
or
the
most
intricate
analysis
and
am
in
my
own
proper
atmosphere
can
dispense
then
with
artificial
stimulants
but
abhor
the
dull
routine
of
existence
crave
for
mental
exaltation
that
is
why
have
chosen
my
own
particular
profession
or
rather
created
it
for
am
the
only
one
in
the
world
the
only
unofficial
detective
said
raising
my
eyebrows
the
only
unofficial
consulting
detective
he
answered
am
the
last
and
highest
court
of
appeal
in
detection
when
gregson
or
lestrade
or
athelney
jones
are
out
of
their
depths
which
by
the
way
is
their
normal
state
the
matter
is
laid
before
me
examine
the
data
as
an
expert
and
pronounce
specialist
opinion
claim
no
credit
in
such
cases
my
name
figures
in
no
newspaper
the
work
itself
the
pleasure
of
finding
field
for
my
peculiar
powers
is
my
highest
reward
but
you
have
yourself
had
some
experience
of
my
methods
of
work
in
the
jefferson
hope
case
yes
indeed
said
cordially
was
never
so
struck
by
anything
in
my
life
even
embodied
it
in
small
brochure
with
the
somewhat
fantastic
title
of
study
in
scarlet
he
shook
his
head
sadly
glanced
over
it
said
he
honestly
cannot
congratulate
you
upon
it
detection
is
or
ought
to
be
an
exact
science
and
should
be
treated
in
the
same
cold
and
unemotional
manner
you
have
attempted
to
tinge
it
with
romanticism
which
produces
much
the
same
effect
as
if
you
worked
love
story
or
an
elopement
into
the
fifth
proposition
of
euclid
but
the
romance
was
there
remonstrated
could
not
tamper
with
the
facts
some
facts
should
be
suppressed
or
at
least
just
sense
of
proportion
should
be
observed
in
treating
them
the
only
point
in
the
case
which
deserved
mention
was
the
curious
analytical
reasoning
from
effects
to
causes
by
which
succeeded
in
unraveling
it
was
annoyed
at
this
criticism
of
work
which
had
been
specially
designed
to
please
him
confess
too
that
was
irritated
by
the
egotism
which
seemed
to
demand
that
every
line
of
my
pamphlet
should
be
devoted
to
his
own
special
doings
more
than
once
during
the
years
that
had
lived
with
him
in
baker
street
had
observed
that
small
vanity
underlay
my
companion
quiet
and
didactic
manner
made
no
remark
however
but
sat
nursing
my
wounded
leg
had
jezail
bullet
through
it
some
time
before
and
though
it
did
not
prevent
me
from
walking
it
ached
wearily
at
every
change
of
the
weather
my
practice
has
extended
recently
to
the
continent
said
holmes
after
while
filling
up
his
old
brier
root
pipe
was
consulted
last
week
by
françois
le
villard
who
as
you
probably
know
has
come
rather
to
the
front
lately
in
the
french
detective
service
he
has
all
the
celtic
power
of
quick
intuition
but
he
is
deficient
in
the
wide
range
of
exact
knowledge
which
is
essential
to
the
higher
developments
of
his
art
the
case
was
concerned
with
will
and
possessed
some
features
of
interest
was
able
to
refer
him
to
two
parallel
cases
the
one
at
riga
in
1857
and
the
other
at
st
louis
in
1871
which
have
suggested
to
him
the
true
solution
here
is
the
letter
which
had
this
morning
acknowledging
my
assistance
he
tossed
over
as
he
spoke
crumpled
sheet
of
foreign
notepaper
glanced
my
eyes
down
it
catching
profusion
of
notes
of
admiration
with
stray
magnifiques
coup
de
maîtres
and
tours
de
force
all
testifying
to
the
ardent
admiration
of
the
frenchman
he
speaks
as
pupil
to
his
master
said
oh
he
rates
my
assistance
too
highly
said
sherlock
holmes
lightly
he
has
considerable
gifts
himself
he
possesses
two
out
of
the
three
qualities
necessary
for
the
ideal
detective
he
has
the
power
of
observation
and
that
of
deduction
he
is
only
wanting
in
knowledge
and
that
may
come
in
time
he
is
now
translating
my
small
works
into
french
your
works
oh
didn
you
know
he
cried
laughing
yes
have
been
guilty
of
several
monographs
they
are
all
upon
technical
subjects
here
for
example
is
one
upon
the
distinction
between
the
ashes
of
the
various
tobaccos
in
it
enumerate
hundred
and
forty
forms
of
cigar
cigarette
and
pipe
tobacco
with
coloured

illustrating
the
difference
in
the
ash
it
is
point
which
is
continually
turning
up
in
criminal
trials
and
which
is
sometimes
of
supreme
importance
as
clue
if
you
can
say
definitely
for
example
that
some
murder
has
been
done
by
man
who
was
smoking
an
indian
lunkah
it
obviously
narrows
your
field
of
search
to
the
trained
eye
there
is
as
much
difference
between
the
black
ash
of
trichinopoly
and
the
white
fluff
of
bird
eye
as
there
is
between
cabbage
and
potato
you
have
an
extraordinary
genius
for
minutiae
remarked
appreciate
their
importance
here
is
my
monograph
upon
the
tracing
of
footsteps
with
some
remarks
upon
the
uses
of
plaster
of
paris
as
preserver
of
impresses
here
too
is
curious
little
work
upon
the
influence
of
trade
upon
the
form
of
the
hand
with
lithotypes
of
the
hands
of
slaters
sailors
cork
cutters
compositors
weavers
and
diamond
polishers
that
is
matter
of
great
practical
interest
to
the
scientific
detective
especially
in
cases
of
unclaimed
bodies
or
in
discovering
the
antecedents
of
criminals
but
weary
you
with
my
hobby
not
at
all
answered
earnestly
it
is
of
the
greatest
interest
to
me
especially
since
have
had
the
opportunity
of
observing
your
practical
application
of
it
but
you
spoke
just
now
of
observation
and
deduction
surely
the
one
to
some
extent
implies
the

why
hardly
he
answered
leaning
back
luxuriously
in
his
armchair
and
sending
up
thick
blue
wreaths
from
his
pipe
for
example
observation
shows
me
that
you
have
been
to
the
wigmore
street
post
office
this
morning
but
deduction
lets
me
know
that
when
there
you
dispatched
telegram
right
said
right
on
both
points
but
confess
that
don
see
how
you
arrived
at
it
was
sudden
impulse
upon
my
part
and
have
mentioned
it
to
no
one
it
is
simplicity
itself
he
remarked
chuckling
at
my
surprise—
so
absurdly
simple
that
an
explanation
is
superfluous
and
yet
it
may
serve
to
define
the
limits
of
observation
and
of
deduction
observation
tells
me
that
you
have
little
reddish
mould
adhering
to
your
instep
just
opposite
the
seymour
street
office
they
have
taken
up
the
pavement
and
thrown
up
some
earth
which
lies
in
such
way
that
it
is
difficult
to
avoid
treading
in
it
in
entering
the
earth
is
of
this
peculiar
reddish
tint
which
is
found
as
far
as
know
nowhere
else
in
the
neighborhood
so
much
is
observation
the
rest
is
deduction
how
then
did
you
deduce
the
telegram
why
of
course
knew
that
you
had
not
written
letter
since
sat
opposite
to
you
all
morning
see
also
in
your
open
desk
there
that
you
have
sheet
of
stamps
and
thick
bundle
of
postcards
what
could
you
go
into
the
post
office
for
then
but
to
send
wire
eliminate
all
other
factors
and
the
one
which
remains
must
be
the
truth
in
this
case
it
certainly
is
so
replied
after
little
thought
the
thing
however
is
as
you
say
of
the
simplest
would
you
think
me
impertinent
if
were
to
put
your
theories
to
more
severe
test
on
the
contrary
he
answered
it
would
prevent
me
from
taking
second
dose
of
cocaine
should
be
delighted
to
look
into
any
problem
which
you
might
submit
to
me
have
heard
you
say
that
it
is
difficult
for
man
to
have
any
object
in
daily
use
without
leaving
the
impress
of
his
individuality
upon
it
in
such
way
that
trained
observer
might
read
it
now
have
here
watch
which
has
recently
come
into
my
possession
would
you
have
the
kindness
to
let
me
have
an
opinion
upon
the
character
or
habits
of
the
late
owner
handed
him
over
the
watch
with
some
slight
feeling
of
amusement
in
my
heart
for
the
test
was
as
thought
an
impossible
one
and
intended
it
as
lesson
against
the
somewhat
dogmatic
tone
which
he
occasionally
assumed
he
balanced
the
watch
in
his
hand
gazed
hard
at
the
dial
opened
the
back
and
examined
the
works
first
with
his
naked
eyes
and
then
with
powerful
convex
lens
could
hardly
keep
from
smiling
at
his
crestfallen
face
when
he
finally
snapped
the
case
to
and
handed
it
back
there
are
hardly
any
data
he
remarked
the
watch
has
been
recently
cleaned
which
robs
me
of
my
most
suggestive
facts
you
are
right
answered
it
was
cleaned
before
being
sent
to
me
in
my
heart
accused
my
companion
of
putting
forward
most
lame
and
impotent
excuse
to
cover
his
failure
what
data
could
he
expect
from
an
uncleaned
watch
though
unsatisfactory
my
research
has
not
been
entirely
barren
he
observed
staring
up
at
the
ceiling
with
dreamy
lack
lustre
eyes
subject
to
your
correction
should
judge
that
the
watch
belonged
to
your
elder
brother
who
inherited
it
from
your
father
that
you
gather
no
doubt
from
the
upon
the
back
quite
so
the
suggests
your
own
name
the
date
of
the
watch
is
nearly
fifty
years
back
and
the
initials
are
as
old
as
the
watch
so
it
was
made
for
the
last
generation
jewelry
usually
descends
to
the
eldest
son
and
he
is
most
likely
to
have
the
same
name
as
the
father
your
father
has
if
remember
right
been
dead
many
years
it
has
therefore
been
in
the
hands
of
your
eldest
brother
right
so
far
said
anything
else
he
was
man
of
untidy
habits
very
untidy
and
careless
he
was
left
with
good
prospects
but
he
threw
away
his
chances
lived
for
some
time
in
poverty
with
occasional
short
intervals
of
prosperity
and
finally
taking
to
drink
he
died
that
is
all
can
gather
sprang
from
my
chair
and
limped
impatiently
about
the
room
with
considerable
bitterness
in
my
heart
this
is
unworthy
of
you
holmes
said
could
not
have
believed
that
you
would
have
descended
to
this
you
have
made
inquires
into
the
history
of
my
unhappy
brother
and
you
now
pretend
to
deduce
this
knowledge
in
some
fanciful
way
you
cannot
expect
me
to
believe
that
you
have
read
all
this
from
his
old
watch
it
is
unkind
and
to
speak
plainly
has
touch
of
charlatanism
in
it
my
dear
doctor
said
he
kindly
pray
accept
my
apologies
viewing
the
matter
as
an
abstract
problem
had
forgotten
how
personal
and
painful
thing
it
might
be
to
you
assure
you
however
that
never
even
know
that
you
had
brother
until
you
handed
me
the
watch
then
how
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
wonderful
did
you
get
these
facts
they
are
absolutely
correct
in
every
particular
ah
that
is
good
luck
could
only
say
what
was
the
balance
of
probability
did
not
at
all
expect
to
be
so
accurate
but
it
was
not
mere
guess
work
no
never
guess
it
is
shocking
habit
destructive
to
the
logical
faculty
what
seems
strange
to
you
is
only
so
because
you
do
not
follow
my
train
of
thought
or
observe
the
small
facts
upon
which
large
inferences
may
depend
for
example
began
by
stating
that
your
brother
was
careless
when
you
observe
the
lower
part
of
that
watch
case
you
notice
that
it
is
not
only
dinted
in
two
places
but
it
is
cut
and
marked
all
over
from
the
habit
of
keeping
other
hard
objects
such
as
coins
or
keys
in
the
same
pocket
surely
it
is
no
great
feat
to
assume
that
man
who
treats
fifty
guinea
watch
so
cavalierly
must
be
careless
man
neither
is
it
very
far
fetched
inference
that
man
who
inherits
one
article
of
such
value
is
pretty
well
provided
for
in
other
respects
nodded
to
show
that
followed
his
reasoning
it
is
very
customary
for
pawnbrokers
in
england
when
they
take
watch
to
scratch
the
numbers
of
the
ticket
with
pin
point
upon
the
inside
of
the
case
it
is
more
handy
than
label
as
there
is
no
risk
of
the
number
being
lost
or
transposed
there
are
no
less
than
four
such
numbers
visible
to
my
lens
on
the
inside
of
this
case
inference
that
your
brother
was
often
at
low
water
secondary
inference
that
he
had
occasional
bursts
of
prosperity
or
he
could
not
have
redeemed
the
pledge
finally
ask
you
to
look
at
the
inner
plate
which
contains
the
keyhole
look
at
the
thousands
of
scratches
all
round
the
hole
marks
where
the
key
has
slipped
what
sober
man
key
could
have
scored
those
grooves
but
you
will
never
see
drunkard
watch
without
them
he
winds
it
at
night
and
he
leaves
these
traces
of
his
unsteady
hand
where
is
the
mystery
in
all
this
it
is
as
clear
as
daylight
answered
regret
the
injustice
which
did
you
should
have
had
more
faith
in
your
marvellous
faculty
may
ask
whether
you
have
any
professional
inquiry
on
foot
at
present
none

work
what
else
is
there
to
live
for

at
the
window
here
was
ever
such
dreary
dismal
unprofitable
world
see
how
the
yellow
fog
swirls
down
the
street
and
drifts
across
the
dun
coloured
houses
what
could
be
more
hopelessly
prosaic
and
material
what
is
the
use
of
having
powers
doctor
when
one
has
no
field
upon

to
exert

crime

commonplace
existence
is
commonplace

no

had
opened
my
mouth
to
reply
to
this
tirade
when
with
crisp
knock
our
landlady
entered
bearing
card
upon
the
brass
salver
young
lady
for
you
sir
she
said
addressing
my
companion
miss
mary
morstan
he
read
hum
have
no
recollection

ask
the
young
lady
to
step

that
you
remain
ii
the
statement
of
the
case
miss
morstan
entered
the
room
with
firm
step
and
an
outward
composure
of
manner
she
was
blonde
young
lady
small
dainty
well
gloved
and
dressed
in
the
most
perfect
taste
there
was
however
plainness
and
simplicity
about
her
costume
which
bore
with
it
suggestion
of
limited
means
the
dress
was
sombre
greyish
beige
untrimmed
and
unbraided
and
she
wore
small
turban
of
the
same
dull
hue
relieved
only
by
suspicion
of
white
feather
in
the
side
her
face
had
neither
regularity
of
feature
nor
beauty
of
complexion
but
her
expression
was
sweet
and
amiable
and
her
large
blue
eyes
were
singularly
spiritual
and
sympathetic
in
an
experience
of
women
which
extends
over
many
nations
and
three
separate
continents
have
never
looked
upon
face
which
gave
clearer
promise
of
refined
and
sensitive
nature
could
not
but
observe
that
as
she
took
the
seat
which
sherlock
holmes
placed
for
her
lip
trembled
her
hand
quivered
and
she
showed
every
sign
of
intense
inward
agitation

have
come
to
you
mr
holmes
she
said
because
you
once
enabled
my
employer
mrs
cecil
forrester
to
unravel
little
domestic
complication
she
was
much
impressed
by
your
kindness
and
skill
mrs
cecil
forrester
he
repeated
thoughtfully
believe
that
was
of
some
slight
service
to
her
the
case
however
as
remember
it
was
very
simple
one
she
did
not
think
so
but
at
least
you
cannot
say
the
same
of
mine
can
hardly
imagine
anything
more
strange
more
utterly
inexplicable
than
the
situation
in
which
find
myself
holmes
rubbed
his
hands
and
his
eyes
glistened
he
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
with
an
expression
of
extraordinary
concentration
upon
his
clear
cut
hawk
like
features
state
your
case
said
he
in
brisk
business
tones
felt
that
my
position
was
an
embarrassing
one
you
will
am
sure
excuse
me
said
rising
from
my
chair
to
my
surprise
the
young
lady
held
up
her
gloved
hand
to
detain
me
if
your
friend
she
said
would
be
good
enough
to
stop
he
might
be
of
inestimable
service
to
me
relapsed
into
my
chair
briefly
she
continued
the
facts
are
these
my
father
was
an
officer
in
an
indian
regiment
who
sent
me
home
when
was
quite
child
my
mother
was
dead
and
had
no
relative
in
england
was
placed
however
in
comfortable
boarding
establishment
at
edinburgh
and
there
remained
until
was
seventeen
years
of
age
in
the
year
1878
my
father
who
was
senior
captain
of
his
regiment
obtained
twelve
months
leave
and
came
home
he
telegraphed
to
me
from
london
that
he
had
arrived
all
safe
and
directed
me
to
come
down
at
once
giving
the
langham
hotel
as
his
address
his
message
as
remember
was
full
of
kindness
and
love
on
reaching
london
drove
to
the
langham
and
was
informed
that
captain
morstan
was
staying
there
but
that
he
had
gone
out
the
night
before
and
had
not
yet
returned
waited
all
day
without
news
of
him
that
night
on
the
advice
of
the
manager
of
the
hotel
communicated
with
the
police
and
next
morning
we
advertised
in
all
the
papers
our
inquiries
led
to
no
result
and
from
that
day
to
this
no
word
has
ever
been
heard
of
my
unfortunate
father
he
came
home
with
his
heart
full
of
hope
to
find
some
peace
some
comfort
and
instead—
she
put
her
hand
to
her
throat
and
choking
sob
cut
short
the
sentence
the
date
asked
holmes
opening
his
note
book
he
disappeared
upon
the
3rd
of
december
1878—nearly
ten
years
ago
his
luggage
remained
at
the
hotel
there
was
nothing
in
it
to
suggest
clue
some
clothes
some
books
and
considerable
number
of
curiosities
from
the
andaman
islands
he
had
been
one
of
the
officers
in
charge
of
the
convict
guard
there
had
he
any
friends
in
town
only
one
that
we
know
of
major
sholto
of
his
own
regiment
the
34th
bombay
infantry
the
major
had
retired
some
little
time
before
and
lived
at
upper
norwood
we
communicated
with
him
of
course
but
he
did
not
even
know
that
his
brother
officer
was
in
england
singular
case
remarked
holmes
have
not
yet
described
to
you
the
most
singular
part
about
six
years
ago
to
be
exact
upon
the
4th
of
may
1882—an
advertisement
appeared
in
the
times
asking
for
the
address
of
miss
mary
morstan
and
stating
that
it
would
be
to
her
advantage
to
come
forward
there
was
no
name
or
address
appended
had
at
that
time
just
entered
the
family
of
mrs
cecil
forrester
in
the
capacity
of
governess
by
her
advice
published
my
address
in
the
advertisement
column
the
same
day
there
arrived
through
the
post
small
cardboard
box
addressed
to
me
which
found
to
contain
very
large
lustrous
pearl
no
word
of
writing
was
enclosed
since
then
every
year
upon
the
same
date
there
has
always
appeared
similar
box
containing
similar
pearl
without
any
clue
as
to
the
sender
they
have
been
pronounced
by
an
expert
to
be
of
rare
variety
and
of
considerable
value
you
can
see
for
yourselves
that
they
are
very
handsome
she
opened
flat
box
as
she
spoke
and
showed
me
six
of
the
finest
pearls
that
had
ever
seen
your
statement
is
most
interesting
said
sherlock
holmes
has
anything
else
occurred
to
you
yes
and
no
later
than
to
day
that
is
why
have
come
to
you

morning

life
and
have
no
friends
whom
could
appeal
to
if
am
here
at
six
it
will
do
suppose
you
must
not
be
later
said
holmes
there
is
one
other
point
however
is
this
handwriting
the
same
as
that
upon
the
pearl
box
addresses
have
them
here
she
answered
producing
half
dozen
pieces
of
paper
you
are
certainly
model
client
you
have
the
correct
intuition
let
us
see
now
he
spread
out
the
papers
upon
the
table
and
gave
little
darting
glances
from
one
to
the
other
they
are
disguised
hands
except
the
letter
he
said
presently
but
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
the
authorship
see
how
the
irrepressible
greek
will
break
out
and
see
the
twirl
of
the
final
they
are
undoubtedly
by
the
same
person
should
not
like
to
suggest
false
hopes
miss
morstan
but
is
there
any
resemblance
between
this
hand
and
that
of
your
father
nothing
could
be
more
unlike
expected
to
hear
you
say
so
we
shall
look
out
for
you
then
at
six
pray
allow
me
to
keep
the
papers
may
look
into
the
matter
before
then
it
is
only
half
past
three
au
revoir
then
au
revoir
said
our
visitor
and
with
bright
kindly
glance
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
she
replaced
her
pearl
box
in
her
bosom
and
hurried
away
standing
at
the
window
watched
her
walking
briskly
down
the
street
until
the
grey
turban
and
white
feather
were
but
speck
in
the
sombre
crowd
what
very
attractive
woman
exclaimed
turning
to
my
companion
he
had
lit
his
pipe
again
and
was
leaning
back
with
drooping
eyelids
is
she
he
said
languidly
did
not
observe
you
really
are
an
automaton
calculating
machine
cried
there
is
something
positively
inhuman
in
you
at
times
he
smiled
gently
it
is
of
the
first
importance
he
said
not
to
allow
your
judgment
to
be
biased
by
personal
qualities
client
is
to
me
mere
unit
factor
in
problem
the
emotional
qualities
are
antagonistic
to
clear
reasoning
assure
you
that
the
most
winning
woman
ever
knew
was
hanged
for
poisoning
three
little
children
for
their
insurance
money
and
the
most
repellant
man
of
my
acquaintance
is
philanthropist
who
has
spent
nearly
quarter
of
million
upon
the
london
poor
in
this
case
however—
never
make
exceptions
an
exception
disproves
the
rule
have
you
ever
had
occasion
to
study
character
in
handwriting
what
do
you
make
of
this
fellow
scribble
it
is
legible
and
regular
answered
man
of
business
habits
and
some
force
of
character
holmes
shook
his
head
look
at
his
long
letters
he
said
they
hardly
rise
above
the
common
herd
that
might
be
an
and
that
an
men
of
character
always
differentiate
their
long
letters
however
illegibly
they
may
write
there
is
vacillation
in
his
and
self
esteem
in
his
capitals
am
going
out
now
have
some
few
references
to
make
let
me
recommend
this
book
one
of
the
most
remarkable
ever
penned
it
is
winwood
reade
martyrdom
of
man
shall
be
back
in
an
hour
sat
in
the
window
with
the
volume
in
my
hand
but
my
thoughts
were
far
from
the
daring
speculations
of
the
writer
my
mind
ran
upon
our
late
visitor
her
smiles
the
deep
rich
tones
of
her
voice
the
strange
mystery
which
overhung
her
life
if
she
were
seventeen
at
the
time
of
her
father
disappearance
she
must
be
seven
and
twenty
now
sweet
age
when
youth
has
lost
its
self
consciousness
and
become
little
sobered
by
experience
so
sat
and
mused
until
such
dangerous
thoughts
came
into
my
head
that
hurried
away
to
my
desk
and
plunged
furiously
into
the
latest
treatise
upon
pathology
what
was
an
army
surgeon
with
weak
leg
and
weaker
banking
account
that
should
dare
to
think
of
such
things
she
was
unit
factor
nothing
more
if
my
future
were
black
it
was
better
surely
to
face
it
like
man
than
to
attempt
to
brighten
it
by
mere
will
the
wisps
of
the
imagination

in
quest
of
solution
it
was
half
past
five
before
holmes
returned
he
was
bright
eager
and
in
excellent
spirits
mood
which
in
his
case
alternated
with
fits
of
the
blackest
depression
there
is
no
great
mystery
in
this
matter
he
said
taking
the
cup
of
tea
which
had
poured
out
for
him
the
facts
appear
to
admit
of
only
one
explanation
what
you
have
solved
it
already
well
that
would
be
too
much
to
say
have
discovered
suggestive
fact
that
is
all
it
is
however
very
suggestive
the
details
are
still
to
be
added
have
just
found
on
consulting
the
back
files
of
the
times
that
major
sholto
of
upper
norword
late
of
the
34th
bombay
infantry
died
upon
the
28th
of
april
1882
may
be
very
obtuse
holmes
but
fail
to
see
what
this
suggests
no
you
surprise
me
look
at
it
in
this
way
then
captain
morstan
disappears
the
only
person
in
london
whom
he
could
have
visited
is
major
sholto
major
sholto
denies
having
heard
that
he
was
in
london
four
years
later
sholto
dies
within
week
of
his
death
captain
morstan
daughter
receives
valuable
present
which
is
repeated
from
year
to
year
and
now
culminates
in
letter
which
describes
her
as
wronged
woman
what
wrong
can
it
refer
to
except
this
deprivation
of
her
father
and
why
should
the
presents
begin
immediately
after
sholto
death
unless
it
is
that
sholto
heir
knows
something
of
the
mystery
and
desires
to
make
compensation
have
you
any
alternative
theory
which
will
meet
the
facts
but
what
strange
compensation
and
how
strangely
made
why
too
should
he
write
letter
now
rather
than
six
years
ago
again
the
letter
speaks
of
giving
her
justice
what
justice
can
she
have
it
is
too
much
to
suppose
that
her
father
is
still
alive
there
is
no
other
injustice
in
her
case
that
you
know
of
there
are
difficulties
there
are
certainly
difficulties
said
sherlock
holmes
pensively
but
our
expedition
of
to
night
will
solve
them
all
ah
here
is
four
wheeler
and
miss
morstan
is
inside
are
you
all
ready
then
we
had
better
go
down
for
it
is
little
past
the
hour
picked
up
my
hat
and
my
heaviest
stick
but
observed
that
holmes
took
his
revolver
from
his
drawer
and
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
it
was
clear
that
he
thought
that
our
night
work
might
be
serious
one
miss
morstan
was
muffled
in
dark
cloak
and
her
sensitive
face
was
composed
but
pale
she
must
have
been
more
than
woman
if
she
did
not
feel
some
uneasiness
at
the
strange
enterprise
upon
which
we
were
embarking
yet
her
self
control
was
perfect
and
she
readily
answered
the
few
additional
questions
which
sherlock
holmes
put
to
her
major
sholto
was
very
particular
friend
of
papa
she
said
his
letters
were
full
of
allusions
to
the
major
he
and
papa
were
in
command
of
the
troops
at
the
andaman
islands
so
they
were
thrown
great
deal
together
by
the
way
curious
paper
was
found
in
papa
desk
which
no
one
could
understand
don
suppose
that
it
is
of
the
slightest
importance
but
thought
you
might
care
to
see
it
so
brought
it
with
me
it
is
here
holmes
unfolded
the
paper
carefully
and
smoothed
it
out
upon
his
knee
he
then
very
methodically
examined
it
all
over
with
his
double
lens
it
is
paper
of
native
indian
manufacture
he
remarked
it
has
at
some
time
been
pinned
to
board
the
diagram
upon
it
appears
to
be
plan
of
part
of
large
building
with
numerous
halls
corridors
and
passages
at
one
point
is
small
cross
done
in
red
ink
and
above
it
is
37
from
left
in
faded
pencil
writing
in
the
left
hand
corner
is
curious
hieroglyphic
like
four
crosses
in
line
with
their
arms
touching
beside
it
is
written
in
very
rough
and
coarse
characters
the
sign
of
the
four
jonathan
small
mahomet
singh
abdullah
khan
dost
akbar
no
confess
that
do
not
see
how
this
bears
upon
the
matter
yet
it
is
evidently
document
of
importance
it
has
been
kept
carefully
in
pocket
book
for
the
one
side
is
as
clean
as
the
other
it
was
in
his
pocket
book
that
we
found
it
preserve
it
carefully
then
miss
morstan
for
it
may
prove
to
be
of
use
to
us
begin
to
suspect
that
this
matter
may
turn
out
to
be
much
deeper
and
more
subtle
than
at
first
supposed
must
reconsider
my
ideas
he
leaned
back
in
the
cab
and
could
see
by
his
drawn
brow
and
his
vacant
eye
that
he
was
thinking
intently
miss
morstan
and
chatted
in
an
undertone
about
our
present
expedition
and
its
possible
outcome
but
our
companion
maintained
his
impenetrable
reserve
until
the
end
of
our
journey
it
was
september
evening
and
not
yet
seven
clock
but
the
day
had
been
dreary
one
and
dense
drizzly
fog
lay
low
upon
the
great
city
mud
coloured
clouds
drooped
sadly
over
the
muddy
streets
down
the
strand
the
lamps
were
but
misty
splotches
of
diffused
light
which
threw
feeble
circular
glimmer
upon
the
slimy
pavement
the
yellow
glare
from
the
shop
windows
streamed
out
into
the
steamy
vaporous
air
and
threw
murky
shifting
radiance
across
the
crowded
thoroughfare
there
was
to
my
mind
something
eerie
and
ghost
like
in
the
endless
procession
of
faces
which
flitted
across
these
narrow
bars
of
light
sad
faces
and
glad
haggard
and
merry
like
all
human
kind
they
flitted
from
the
gloom
into
the
light
and
so
back
into
the
gloom
once
more
am
not
subject
to
impressions
but
the
dull
heavy
evening
with
the
strange
business
upon
which
we
were
engaged
combined
to
make
me
nervous
and
depressed
could
see
from
miss
morstan
manner
that
she
was
suffering
from
the
same
feeling
holmes
alone
could
rise
superior
to
petty
influences
he
held
his
open
notebook
upon
his
knee
and
from
time
to
time
he
jotted
down
figures
and
memoranda
in
the
light
of
his
pocket
lantern
at
the
lyceum
theatre
the
crowds
were
already
thick
at
the
side
entrances
in
front
continuous
stream
of
hansoms
and
four
wheelers
were
rattling
up
discharging
their
cargoes
of
shirt
fronted
men
and
be
shawled
be
diamonded
women
we
had
hardly
reached
the
third
pillar
which
was
our
rendezvous
before
small
dark
brisk
man
in
the
dress
of
coachman
accosted
us
are
you
the
parties
who
come
with
miss
morstan
he
asked
am
miss
morstan
and
these
two
gentlemen
are
my
friends
said
she
he
bent
pair
of
wonderfully
penetrating
and
questioning
eyes
upon
us
you
will
excuse
me
miss
he
said
with
certain
dogged
manner
but
was
to
ask
you
to
give
me
your
word
that
neither
of
your
companions
is
police
officer
give
you
my
word
on
that
she
answered
he
gave
shrill
whistle
on
which
street
arab
led
across
four
wheeler
and
opened
the
door
the
man
who
had
addressed
us
mounted
to
the
box
while
we
took
our
places
inside
we
had
hardly
done
so
before
the
driver
whipped
up
his
horse
and
we
plunged
away
at
furious
pace
through
the
foggy
streets
the
situation
was
curious
one
we
were
driving
to
an
unknown
place
on
an
unknown
errand
yet
our
invitation
was
either
complete
hoax
which
was
an
inconceivable
hypothesis
or
else
we
had
good
reason
to
think
that
important
issues
might
hang
upon
our
journey
miss
morstan
demeanour
was
as
resolute
and
collected
as
ever
endeavored
to
cheer
and
amuse
her
by
reminiscences
of
my
adventures
in
afghanistan
but
to
tell
the
truth
was
myself
so
excited
at
our
situation
and
so
curious
as
to
our
destination
that
my
stories
were
slightly
involved
to
this
day
she
declares
that
told
her
one
moving
anecdote
as
to
how
musket
looked
into
my
tent
at
the
dead
of
night
and
how
fired
double
barrelled
tiger
cub
at
it
at
first
had
some
idea
as
to
the
direction
in
which
we
were
driving
but
soon
what
with
our
pace
the
fog
and
my
own
limited
knowledge
of
london
lost
my
bearings
and
knew
nothing
save
that
we
seemed
to
be
going
very
long
way
sherlock
holmes
was
never
at
fault
however
and
he
muttered
the
names
as
the
cab
rattled
through
squares
and
in
and
out
by
tortuous
by
streets
rochester
row
said
he
now
vincent
square
now
we
come
out
on
the
vauxhall
bridge
road
we
are
making
for
the
surrey
side
apparently
yes
thought
so
now
we
are
on
the
bridge
you
can
catch
glimpses
of
the
river
we
did
indeed
bet
fleeting
view
of
stretch
of
the
thames
with
the
lamps
shining
upon
the
broad
silent
water
but
our
cab
dashed
on
and
was
soon
involved
in
labyrinth
of
streets
upon
the
other
side
wordsworth
road
said
my
companion
priory
road
larkhall
lane
stockwell
place
robert
street
cold
harbour
lane
our
quest
does
not
appear
to
take
us
to
very
fashionable
regions
we
had
indeed
reached
questionable
and
forbidding
neighborhood
long
lines
of
dull
brick
houses
were
only
relieved
by
the
coarse
glare
and
tawdry
brilliancy
of
public
houses
at
the
corner
then
came
rows
of
two
storeyed
villas
each
with
fronting
of
miniature
garden
and
then
again
interminable
lines
of
new
staring
brick
buildings
the
monster
tentacles
which
the
giant
city
was
throwing
out
into
the
country
at
last
the
cab
drew
up
at
the
third
house
in
new
terrace
none
of
the
other
houses
were
inhabited
and
that
at
which
we
stopped
was
as
dark
as
its
neighbors
save
for
single
glimmer
in
the
kitchen
window
on
our
knocking
however
the
door
was
instantly
thrown
open
by
hindoo
servant
clad
in
yellow
turban
white
loose
fitting
clothes
and
yellow
sash
there
was
something
strangely
incongruous
in
this
oriental
figure
framed
in
the
commonplace
doorway
of
third
rate
suburban
dwelling
house

the
sahib
awaits
you
said
he
and
even
as
he
spoke
there
came
high
piping
voice
from
some
inner
room
show
them
in
to
me
khitmutgar
it
cried
show
them
straight
in
to
me
iv
the
story
of
the
bald
headed
man
we
followed
the
indian
down
sordid
and
common
passage
ill
lit
and
worse
furnished
until
he
came
to
door
upon
the
right
which
he
threw
open
blaze
of
yellow
light
streamed
out
upon
us
and
in
the
centre
of
the
glare
there
stood
small
man
with
very
high
head
bristle
of
red
hair
all
round
the
fringe
of
it
and
bald
shining
scalp
which
shot
out
from
among
it
like
mountain
peak
from
fir
trees
he
writhed
his
hands
together
as
he
stood
and
his
features
were
in
perpetual
jerk
now
smiling
now
scowling
but
never
for
an
instant
in
repose
nature
had
given
him
pendulous
lip
and
too
visible
line
of
yellow
and
irregular
teeth
which
he
strove
feebly
to
conceal
by
constantly
passing
his
hand
over
the
lower
part
of
his
face
in
spite
of
his
obtrusive
baldness
he
gave
the
impression
of
youth
in
point
of
fact
he
had
just
turned
his
thirtieth
year
your
servant
miss
morstan
he
kept
repeating
in
thin
high
voice
your
servant
gentlemen
pray
step
into
my
little
sanctum
small
place
miss
but
furnished
to
my
own
liking
an
oasis
of
art
in
the
howling
desert
of
south
london
we
were
all
astonished
by
the
appearance
of
the
apartment
into
which
he
invited
us
in
that
sorry
house
it
looked
as
out
of
place
as
diamond
of
the
first
water
in
setting
of
brass
the
richest
and
glossiest
of
curtains
and
tapestries
draped
the
walls
looped
back
here
and
there
to
expose
some
richly
mounted
painting
or
oriental
vase
the
carpet
was
of
amber
and
black
so
soft
and
so
thick
that
the
foot
sank
pleasantly
into
it
as
into
bed
of
moss
two
great
tiger
skins
thrown
athwart
it
increased
the
suggestion
of
eastern
luxury
as
did
huge
hookah
which
stood
upon
mat
in
the
corner
lamp
in
the
fashion
of
silver
dove
was
hung
from
an
almost
invisible
golden
wire
in
the
centre
of
the
room
as
it
burned
it
filled
the
air
with
subtle
and
aromatic
odour
mr
thaddeus
sholto
said
the
little
man
still
jerking
and
smiling
that
is
my
name
you
are
miss
morstan
of
course
and
these
gentlemen—
this
is
mr
sherlock
holmes
and
this
is
dr
watson
doctor
eh
cried
he
much
excited
have
you
your
stethoscope
might
ask
you
would
you
have
the
kindness
have
grave
doubts
as
to
my
mitral
valve
if
you
would
be
so
very
good
the
aortic
may
rely
upon
but
should
value
your
opinion
upon
the
mitral
listened
to
his
heart
as
requested
but
was
unable
to
find
anything
amiss
save
indeed
that
he
was
in
an
ecstasy
of
fear
for
he
shivered
from
head
to
foot
it
appears
to
be
normal
said
you
have
no
cause
for
uneasiness
you
will
excuse
my
anxiety
miss
morstan
he
remarked
airily
am
great
sufferer
and
have
long
had
suspicions
as
to
that
valve
am
delighted
to
hear
that
they
are
unwarranted
had
your
father
miss
morstan
refrained
from
throwing
strain
upon
his
heart
he
might
have
been
alive
now
could
have
struck
the
man
across
the
face
so
hot
was
at
this
callous
and
offhand
reference
to
so
delicate
matter
miss
morstan
sat
down
and
her
face
grew
white
to
the
lips
knew
in
my
heart
that
he
was
dead
said
she
can
give
you
every
information
said
he
and
what
is
more
can
do
you
justice
and
will
too
whatever
brother
bartholomew
may
say
am
so
glad
to
have
your
friends
here
not
only
as
an
escort
to
you
but
also
as
witnesses
to
what
am
about
to
do
and
say
the
three
of
us
can
show
bold
front
to
brother
bartholomew
but
let
us
have
no
outsiders
no
police
or
officials
we
can
settle
everything
satisfactorily
among
ourselves
without
any
interference
nothing
would
annoy
brother
bartholomew
more
than
any
publicity
he
sat
down
upon
low
settee
and
blinked
at
us
inquiringly
with
his
weak
watery
blue
eyes
for
my
part
said
holmes
whatever
you
may
choose
to
say
will
go
no
further
nodded
to
show
my
agreement
that
is
well
that
is
well
said
he
may
offer
you
glass
of
chianti
miss
morstan
or
of
tokay
keep
no
other
wines
shall
open
flask
no
well
then
trust
that
you
have
no
objection
to
tobacco
smoke
to
the
mild
balsamic
odour
of
the
eastern
tobacco
am
little
nervous
and
find
my
hookah
an
invaluable
sedative
he
applied
taper
to
the
great
bowl
and
the
smoke
bubbled
merrily
through
the
rose
water
we
sat
all
three
in
semicircle
with
our
heads
advanced
and
our
chins
upon
our
hands
while
the
strange
jerky
little
fellow
with
his
high
shining
head
puffed
uneasily
in
the
centre
when
first
determined
to
make
this
communication
to
you
said
he
might
have
given
you
my
address
but
feared
that
you
might
disregard
my
request
and
bring
unpleasant
people
with
you
took
the
liberty
therefore
of
making
an
appointment
in
such
way
that
my
man
williams
might
be
able
to
see
you
first
have
complete
confidence
in
his
discretion
and
he
had
orders
if
he
were
dissatisfied
to
proceed
no
further
in
the
matter
you
will
excuse
these
precautions
but
am
man
of
somewhat
retiring
and
might
even
say
refined
tastes
and
there
is
nothing
more
unaesthetic
than
policeman
have
natural
shrinking
from
all
forms
of
rough
materialism
seldom
come
in
contact
with
the
rough
crowd
live
as
you
see
with
some
little
atmosphere
of
elegance
around
me
may
call
myself
patron
of
the
arts
it
is
my
weakness
the
landscape
is
genuine
corot
and
though
connoisseur
might
perhaps
throw
doubt
upon
that
salvator
rosa
there
cannot
be
the
least
question
about
the
bouguereau
am
partial
to
the
modern
french
school
you
will
excuse
me
mr
sholto
said
miss
morstan
but
am
here
at
your
request
to
learn
something
which
you
desire
to
tell
me
it
is
very
late
and
should
desire
the
interview
to
be
as
short
as
possible
at
the
best
it
must
take
some
time
he
answered
for
we
shall
certainly
have
to
go
to
norwood
and
see
brother
bartholomew
we
shall
all
go
and
try
if
we
can
get
the
better
of
brother
bartholomew
he
is
very
angry
with
me
for
taking
the
course
which
has
seemed
right
to
me
had
quite
high
words
with
him
last
night
you
cannot
imagine
what
terrible
fellow
he
is
when
he
is
angry
if
we
are
to
go
to
norwood
it
would
perhaps
be
as
well
to
start
at
once
ventured
to
remark
he
laughed
until
his
ears
were
quite
red
that
would
hardly
do
he
cried
don
know
what
he
would
say
if
brought
you
in
that
sudden
way
no
must
prepare
you
by
showing
you
how
we
all
stand
to
each
other
in
the
first
place
must
tell
you
that
there
are
several
points
in
the
story
of
which
am
myself
ignorant
can
only
lay
the
facts
before
you
as
far
as
know
them
myself
my
father
was
as
you
may
have
guessed
major
john
sholto
once
of
the
indian
army
he
retired
some
eleven
years
ago
and
came
to
live
at
pondicherry
lodge
in
upper
norwood
he
had
prospered
in
india
and
brought
back
with
him
considerable
sum
of
money
large
collection
of
valuable
curiosities
and
staff
of
native
servants
with
these
advantages
he
bought
himself
house
and
lived
in
great
luxury
my
twin
brother
bartholomew
and
were
the
only
children
very
well
remember
the
sensation
which
was
caused
by
the
disappearance
of
captain
morstan
we
read
the
details
in
the
papers
and
knowing
that
he
had
been
friend
of
our
father
we
discussed
the
case
freely
in
his
presence
he
used
to
join
in
our
speculations
as
to
what
could
have
happened
never
for
an
instant
did
we
suspect
that
he
had
the
whole
secret
hidden
in
his
own
breast
that
of
all
men
he
alone
knew
the
fate
of
arthur
morstan
we
did
know
however
that
some
mystery
some
positive
danger
overhung
our
father
he
was
very
fearful
of
going
out
alone
and
he
always
employed
two
prize
fighters
to
act
as
porters
at
pondicherry
lodge
williams
who
drove
you
to
night
was
one
of
them
he
was
once
light
weight
champion
of
england
our
father
would
never
tell
us
what
it
was
he
feared
but
he
had
most
marked
aversion
to
men
with
wooden
legs
on
one
occasion
he
actually
fired
his
revolver
at
wooden
legged
man
who
proved
to
be
harmless
tradesman
canvassing
for
orders
we
had
to
pay
large
sum
to
hush
the
matter
up
my
brother
and
used
to
think
this
mere
whim
of
my
father
but
events
have
since
led
us
to
change
our
opinion
early
in
1882
my
father
received
letter
from
india
which
was
great
shock
to
him
he
nearly
fainted
at
the
breakfast
table
when
he
opened
it
and
from
that
day
he
sickened
to
his
death
what
was
in
the
letter
we
could
never
discover
but
could
see
as
he
held
it
that
it
was
short
and
written
in
scrawling
hand
he
had
suffered
for
years
from
an
enlarged
spleen
but
he
now
became
rapidly
worse
and
towards
the
end
of
april
we
were
informed
that
he
was
beyond
all
hope
and
that
he
wished
to
make
last
communication
to
us

when
we
entered
his
room
he
was
propped
up
with
pillows
and
breathing
heavily
he
besought
us
to
lock
the
door
and
to
come
upon
either
side
of
the
bed
then
grasping
our
hands
he
made
remarkable
statement
to
us
in
voice
which
was
broken
as
much
by
emotion
as
by
pain
shall
try
and
give
it
to
you
in
his
own
very
words
have
only
one
thing
he
said
which
weighs
upon
my
mind
at
this
supreme
moment
it
is
my
treatment
of
poor
morstan
orphan
the
cursed
greed
which
has
been
my
besetting
sin
through
life
has
withheld
from
her
the
treasure
half
at
least
of
which
should
have
been
hers
and
yet
have
made
no
use
of
it
myself
so
blind
and
foolish
thing
is
avarice
the
mere
feeling
of
possession
has
been
so
dear
to
me
that
could
not
bear
to
share
it
with
another
see
that
chaplet
dipped
with
pearls
beside
the
quinine
bottle
even
that
could
not
bear
to
part
with
although
had
got
it
out
with
the
design
of
sending
it
to
her
you
my
sons
will
give
her
fair
share
of
the
agra
treasure
but
send
her
nothing
not
even
the
chaplet
until
am
gone
after
all
men
have
been
as
bad
as
this
and
have
recovered
will
tell
you
how
morstan
died
he
continued
he
had
suffered
for
years
from
weak
heart
but
he
concealed
it
from
every
one
alone
knew
it
when
in
india
he
and
through
remarkable
chain
of
circumstances
came
into
possession
of
considerable
treasure
brought
it
over
to
england
and
on
the
night
of
morstan
arrival
he
came
straight
over
here
to
claim
his
share
he
walked
over
from
the
station
and
was
admitted
by
my
faithful
lal
chowdar
who
is
now
dead
morstan
and
had
difference
of
opinion
as
to
the
division
of
the
treasure
and
we
came
to
heated
words
morstan
had
sprung
out
of
his
chair
in
paroxysm
of
anger
when
he
suddenly
pressed
his
hand
to
his
side
his
face
turned
dusky
hue
and
he
fell
backwards
cutting
his
head
against
the
corner
of
the
treasure
chest
when
stooped
over
him
found
to
my
horror
that
he
was
dead
for
long
time
sat
half
distracted
wondering
what
should
do
my
first
impulse
was
of
course
to
call
for
assistance
but
could
not
but
recognize
that
there
was
every
chance
that
would
be
accused
of
his
murder
his
death
at
the
moment
of
quarrel
and
the
gash
in
his
head
would
be
black
against
me
again
an
official
inquiry
could
not
be
made
without
bringing
out
some
facts
about
the
treasure
which
was
particularly
anxious
to
keep
secret
he
had
told
me
that
no
soul
upon
earth
knew
where
he
had
gone
there
seemed
to
be
no
necessity
why
any
soul
ever
should
know
was
still
pondering
over
the
matter
when
looking
up
saw
my
servant
lal
chowdar
in
the
doorway
he
stole
in
and
bolted
the
door
behind
him
do
not
fear
sahib
he
said
no
one
need
know
that
you
have
killed
him
let
us
hide
him
away
and
who
is
the
wiser
did
not
kill
him
said
lal
chowdar
shook
his
head
and
smiled
heard
it
all
sahib
said
he
heard
you
quarrel
and
heard
the
blow
but
my
lips
are
sealed
all
are
asleep
in
the
house
let
us
put
him
away
together
that
was
enough
to
decide
me
if
my
own
servant
could
not
believe
my
innocence
how
could
hope
to
make
it
good
before
twelve
foolish
tradesmen
in
jury
box
lal
chowdar
and
disposed
of
the
body
that
night
and
within
few
days
the
london
papers
were
full
of
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
captain
morstan
you
will
see
from
what
say
that
can
hardly
be
blamed
in
the
matter
my
fault
lies
in
the
fact
that
we
concealed
not
only
the
body
but
also
the
treasure
and
that
have
clung
to
morstan
share
as
well
as
to
my
own
wish
you
therefore
to
make
restitution
put
your
ears
down
to
my
mouth
the
treasure
is
hidden
in—
at
this
instant
horrible
change
came
over
his
expression
his
eyes
stared
wildly
his
jaw
dropped
and
he
yelled
in
voice
which
can
never
forget
keep
him
out
for
christ
sake
keep
him
out
we
both
stared
round
at
the
window
behind
us
upon
which
his
gaze
was
fixed
face
was
looking
in
at
us
out
of
the
darkness
we
could
see
the
whitening
of
the
nose
where
it
was
pressed
against
the
glass
it
was
bearded
hairy
face
with
wild
cruel
eyes
and
an
expression
of
concentrated
malevolence
my
brother
and
rushed
towards
the
window
but
the
man
was
gone
when
we
returned
to
my
father
his
head
had
dropped
and
his
pulse
had
ceased
to
beat
we
searched
the
garden
that
night
but
found
no
sign
of
the
intruder
save
that
just
under
the
window
single
footmark
was
visible
in
the
flower
bed
but
for
that
one
trace
we
might
have
thought
that
our
imaginations
had
conjured
up
that
wild
fierce
face
we
soon
however
had
another
and
more
striking
proof
that
there
were
secret
agencies
at
work
all
round
us
the
window
of
my
father
room
was
found
open
in
the
morning
his
cupboards
and
boxes
had
been
rifled
and
upon
his
chest
was
fixed
torn
piece
of
paper
with
the
words
the
sign
of
the
four
scrawled
across
it
what
the
phrase
meant
or
who
our
secret
visitor
may
have
been
we
never
knew
as
far
as
we
can
judge
none
of
my
father
property
had
been
actually
stolen
though
everything
had
been
turned
out
my
brother
and
naturally
associated
this
peculiar
incident
with
the
fear
which
haunted
my
father
during
his
life
but
it
is
still
complete
mystery
to
us
the
little
man
stopped
to
relight
his
hookah
and
puffed
thoughtfully
for
few
moments
we
had
all
sat
absorbed
listening
to
his
extraordinary
narrative
at
the
short
account
of
her
father
death
miss
morstan
had
turned
deadly
white
and
for
moment
feared
that
she
was
about
to
faint
she
rallied
however
on
drinking
glass
of
water
which
quietly
poured
out
for
her
from
venetian
carafe
upon
the
side
table
sherlock
holmes
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
an
abstracted
expression
and
the
lids
drawn
low
over
his
glittering
eyes
as
glanced
at
him
could
not
but
think
how
on
that
very
day
he
had
complained
bitterly
of
the
commonplaceness
of
life
here
at
least
was
problem
which
would
tax
his
sagacity
to
the
utmost
mr
thaddeus
sholto
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
with
an
obvious
pride
at
the
effect
which
his
story
had
produced
and
then
continued
between
the
puffs
of
his
overgrown
pipe
my
brother
and
said
he
were
as
you
may
imagine
much
excited
as
to
the
treasure
which
my
father
had
spoken
of
for
weeks
and
for
months
we
dug
and
delved
in
every
part
of
the
garden
without
discovering
its
whereabouts
it
was
maddening
to
think
that
the
hiding
place
was
on
his
very
lips
at
the
moment
that
he
died
we
could
judge
the
splendor
of
the
missing
riches
by
the
chaplet
which
he
had
taken
out
over
this
chaplet
my
brother
bartholomew
and
had
some
little
discussion
the
pearls
were
evidently
of
great
value
and
he
was
averse
to
part
with
them
for
between
friends
my
brother
was
himself
little
inclined
to
my
father
fault
he
thought
too
that
if
we
parted
with
the
chaplet
it
might
give
rise
to
gossip
and
finally
bring
us
into
trouble
it
was
all
that
could
do
to
persuade
him
to
let
me
find
out
miss
morstan
address
and
send
her
detached
pearl
at
fixed
intervals
so
that
at
least
she
might
never
feel
destitute
it
was
kindly
thought
said
our
companion
earnestly
it
was
extremely
good
of
you
the
little
man
waved
his
hand
deprecatingly
we
were
your
trustees
he
said
that
was
the
view
which
took
of
it
though
brother
bartholomew
could
not
altogether
see
it
in
that
light
we
had
plenty
of
money
ourselves
desired
no
more
besides
it
would
have
been
such
bad
taste
to
have
treated
young
lady
in
so
scurvy
fashion
le
mauvais
goût
mène
au
crime
the
french
have
very
neat
way
of
putting
these
things
our
difference
of
opinion
on
this
subject
went
so
far
that
thought
it
best
to
set
up
rooms
for
myself
so
left
pondicherry
lodge
taking
the
old
khitmutgar
and
williams
with
me
yesterday
however
learn
that
an
event
of
extreme
importance
has
occurred
the
treasure
has
been
discovered
instantly
communicated
with
miss
morstan
and
it
only
remains
for
us
to
drive
out
to
norwood
and
demand
our
share
explained
my
views
last
night
to
brother
bartholomew
so
we
shall
be
expected
if
not
welcome
visitors
mr
thaddeus
sholto
ceased
and
sat
twitching
on
his
luxurious
settee
we
all
remained
silent
with
our
thoughts
upon
the
new
development
which
the
mysterious
business
had
taken
holmes
was
the
first
to
spring
to
his
feet
you
have
done
well
sir
from
first
to
last
said
he
it
is
possible
that
we
may
be
able
to
make
you
some
small
return
by
throwing
some
light
upon
that
which
is
still
dark
to
you
but
as
miss
morstan
remarked
just
now
it
is
late
and
we
had
best
put
the
matter
through
without
delay
our
new
acquaintance
very
deliberately
coiled
up
the
tube
of
his
hookah
and
produced
from
behind
curtain
very
long
befrogged
topcoat
with
astrakhan
collar
and
cuffs
this
he
buttoned
tightly
up
in
spite
of
the
extreme
closeness
of
the
night
and
finished
his
attire
by
putting
on
rabbit
skin
cap
with
hanging
lappets
which
covered
the
ears
so
that
no
part
of
him
was
visible
save
his
mobile
and
peaky
face

my
health
is
somewhat
fragile
he
remarked
as
he
led
the
way
down
the
passage
am
compelled
to
be
valetudinarian
our
cab
was
awaiting
us
outside
and
our
programme
was
evidently
prearranged
for
the
driver
started
off
at
once
at
rapid
pace
thaddeus
sholto
talked
incessantly
in
voice
which
rose
high
above
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
bartholomew
is
clever
fellow
said
he
how
do
you
think
he
found
out
where
the
treasure
was
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
somewhere
indoors
so
he
worked
out
all
the
cubic
space
of
the
house
and
made
measurements
everywhere
so
that
not
one
inch
should
be
unaccounted
for
among
other
things
he
found
that
the
height
of
the
building
was
seventy
four
feet
but
on
adding
together
the
heights
of
all
the
separate
rooms
and
making
every
allowance
for
the
space
between
which
he
ascertained
by
borings
he
could
not
bring
the
total
to
more
than
seventy
feet
there
were
four
feet
unaccounted
for
these
could
only
be
at
the
top
of
the
building
he
knocked
hole
therefore
in
the
lath
and
plaster
ceiling
of
the
highest
room
and
there
sure
enough
he
came
upon
another
little
garret
above
it
which
had
been
sealed
up
and
was
known
to
no
one
in
the
centre
stood
the
treasure
chest
resting
upon
two
rafters
he
lowered
it
through
the
hole
and
there
it
lies
he
computes
the
value
of
the
jewels
at
not
less
than
half
million
sterling
at
the
mention
of
this
gigantic
sum
we
all
stared
at
one
another
open
eyed
miss
morstan
could
we
secure
her
rights
would
change
from
needy
governess
to
the
richest
heiress
in
england
surely
it
was
the
place
of
loyal
friend
to
rejoice
at
such
news
yet
am
ashamed
to
say
that
selfishness
took
me
by
the
soul
and
that
my
heart
turned
as
heavy
as
lead
within
me
stammered
out
some
few
halting
words
of
congratulation
and
then
sat
downcast
with
my
head
drooped
deaf
to
the
babble
of
our
new
acquaintance
he
was
clearly
confirmed
hypochondriac
and
was
dreamily
conscious
that
he
was
pouring
forth
interminable
trains
of
symptoms
and
imploring
information
as
to
the
composition
and
action
of
innumerable
quack
nostrums
some
of
which
he
bore
about
in
leather
case
in
his
pocket
trust
that
he
may
not
remember
any
of
the
answers
which
gave
him
that
night
holmes
declares
that
he
overheard
me
caution
him
against
the
great
danger
of
taking
more
than
two
drops
of
castor
oil
while
recommended
strychnine
in
large
doses
as
sedative
however
that
may
be
was
certainly
relieved
when
our
cab
pulled
up
with
jerk
and
the
coachman
sprang
down
to
open
the
door
this
miss
morstan
is
pondicherry
lodge
said
mr
thaddeus
sholto
as
he
handed
her
out
the
tragedy
of
pondicherry
lodge
it
was
nearly
eleven
clock
when
we
reached
this
final
stage
of
our
night
adventures
we
had
left
the
damp
fog
of
the
great
city
behind
us
and
the
night
was
fairly
fine
warm
wind
blew
from
the
westward
and
heavy
clouds
moved
slowly
across
the
sky
with
half
moon
peeping
occasionally
through
the
rifts
it
was
clear
enough
to
see
for
some
distance
but
thaddeus
sholto
took
down
one
of
the
side
lamps
from
the
carriage
to
give
us
better
light
upon
our
way
pondicherry
lodge
stood
in
its
own
grounds
and
was
girt
round
with
very
high
stone
wall
topped
with
broken
glass
single
narrow
iron
clamped
door
formed
the
only
means
of
entrance
on
this
our
guide
knocked
with
peculiar
postman
like
rat
tat
who
is
there
cried
gruff
voice
from
within
it
is
mcMurdo
you
surely
know
my
knock
by
this
time
there
was
grumbling
sound
and
clanking
and
jarring
of
keys
the
door
swung
heavily
back
and
short
deep
chested
man
stood
in
the
opening
with
the
yellow
light
of
the
lantern
shining
upon
his
protruded
face
and
twinkling
distrustful
eyes
that
you
mr
thaddeus
but
who
are
the
others
had
no
orders
about
them
from
the
master
no
mcMurdo
you
surprise
me
told
my
brother
last
night
that
should
bring
some
friends
he
hain
been
out
his
room
to
day

thaddeus
and
have
no
orders
you
know
very
well
that
must
stick
to
regulations
can
let
you
in
but
your
friends
must
just
stop
where
they
are
this
was
an
unexpected
obstacle
thaddeus
sholto
looked
about
him
in
perplexed
and
helpless
manner
this
is
too
bad
of
you
mcMurdo
he
said
if
guarantee
them
that
is
enough
for
you
there
is
the
young
lady
too
she
cannot
wait
on
the
public
road
at
this
hour
very
sorry
mr
thaddeus
said
the
porter
inexorably
folk
may
be
friends
yours
and
yet
no
friends
the
master
he
pays
me
well
to
do
my
duty
and
my
duty
ll
do
don
know
none
your
friends
oh
yes
you
do
mcMurdo
cried
sherlock
holmes
genially
don
think
you
can
have
forgotten
me
don
you
remember
that
amateur
who
fought
three
rounds
with
you
at
alison
rooms
on
the
night
of
your
benefit
four
years
back
not
mr
sherlock
holmes
roared
the
prize
fighter
god
truth
how
could
have
mistook
you
if
instead
standin
there
so
quiet
you
had
just
stepped
up
and
given
me
that
crosshit
of
yours
under
the
jaw
ha
known
you
without
question
ah
you
re
one
that
has
wasted
your
gifts
you
have
you
might
have
aimed
high
if
you
had
joined
the
fancy
you
see
watson
if
all
else
fails
me
have
still
one
of
the
scientific
professions
open
to
me
said
holmes
laughing
our
friend
won
keep
us
out
in
the
cold
now
am
sure
in
you
come
sir
in
you
come
you
and
your
friends
he
answered
very
sorry
mr
thaddeus
but
orders
are
very
strict
had
to
be
certain
of
your
friends
before
let
them
in
inside
gravel
path
wound
through
desolate
grounds
to
huge
clump
of
house
square
and
prosaic
all
plunged
in
shadow
save
where
moonbeam
struck
one
corner
and
glimmered
in
garret
window
the
vast
size
of
the
building
with
its
gloom
and
its
deathly
silence
struck
chill
to
the
heart
even
thaddeus
sholto
seemed
ill
at
ease
and
the
lantern
quivered
and
rattled
in
his
hand
cannot
understand
it
he
said
there
must
be
some
mistake
distinctly
told
bartholomew
that
we
should
be
here
and
yet
there
is
no
light
in
his
window
do
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
does
he
always
guard
the
premises
in
this
way
asked
holmes
yes
he
has
followed
my
father
custom
he
was
the
favorite
son
you
know
and
sometimes
think
that
my
father
may
have
told
him
more
than
he
ever
told
me
that
is
bartholomew
window
up
there
where
the
moonshine
strikes
it
is
quite
bright
but
there
is
no
light
from
within
think
none
said
holmes
but
see
the
glint
of
light
in
that
little
window
beside
the
door
ah
that
is
the
housekeeper
room
that
is
where
old
mrs
bernstone
sits
she
can
tell
us
all
about
it
but
perhaps
you
would
not
mind
waiting
here
for
minute
or
two
for
if
we
all
go
in
together
and
she
has
no
word
of
our
coming
she
may
be
alarmed
but
hush
what
is
that
he
held
up
the
lantern
and
his
hand
shook
until
the
circles
of
light
flickered
and
wavered
all
round
us
miss
morstan
seized
my
wrist
and
we
all
stood
with
thumping
hearts
straining
our
ears
from
the
great
black
house
there
sounded
through
the
silent
night
the
saddest
and
most
pitiful
of
sounds
the
shrill
broken
whimpering
of
frightened
woman
it
is
mrs
bernstone
said
sholto
she
is
the
only
woman
in
the
house
wait
here
shall
be
back
in
moment
he
hurried
for
the
door
and
knocked
in
his
peculiar
way
we
could
see
tall
old
woman
admit
him
and
sway
with
pleasure
at
the
very
sight
of
him
oh
mr
thaddeus
sir
am
so
glad
you
have
come
am
so
glad
you
have
come
mr
thaddeus
sir
we
heard
her
reiterated
rejoicings
until
the
door
was
closed
and
her
voice
died
away
into
muffled
monotone
our
guide
had
left
us
the
lantern
holmes
swung
it
slowly
round
and
peered
keenly
at
the
house
and
at
the
great
rubbish
heaps
which
cumbered
the
grounds
miss
morstan
and
stood
together
and
her
hand
was
in
mine
wondrous
subtle
thing
is
love
for
here
were
we
two
who
had
never
seen
each
other
before
that
day
between
whom
no
word
or
even
look
of
affection
had
ever
passed
and
yet
now
in
an
hour
of
trouble
our
hands
instinctively
sought
for
each
other
have
marvelled
at
it
since
but
at
the
time
it
seemed
the
most
natural
thing
that
should
go
out
to
her
so
and
as
she
has
often
told
me
there
was
in
her
also
the
instinct
to
turn
to
me
for
comfort
and
protection
so
we
stood
hand
in
hand
like
two
children
and
there
was
peace
in
our
hearts
for
all
the
dark
things
that
surrounded
us
what
strange
place
she
said
looking
round
it
looks
as
though
all
the
moles
in
england
had
been
let
loose
in
it
have
seen
something
of
the
sort
on
the
side
of
hill
near
ballarat
where
the
prospectors
had
been
at
work
and
from
the
same
cause
said
holmes
these
are
the
traces
of
the
treasure
seekers
you
must
remember
that
they
were
six
years
looking
for
it
no
wonder
that
the
grounds
look
like
gravel
pit

at
that
moment
the
door
of
the
house
burst
open
and
thaddeus
sholto
came
running
out
with
his
hands
thrown
forward
and
terror
in
his
eyes
there
is
something
amiss
with
bartholomew
he
cried
am
frightened
my
nerves
cannot
stand
it
he
was
indeed
half
blubbering
with
fear
and
his
twitching
feeble
face
peeping
out
from
the
great
astrakhan
collar
had
the
helpless
appealing
expression
of
terrified
child
come
into
the
house
said
holmes
in
his
crisp
firm
way
yes
do
pleaded
thaddeus
sholto
really
do
not
feel
equal
to
giving
directions
we
all
followed
him
into
the
housekeeper
room
which
stood
upon
the
left
hand
side
of
the
passage
the
old
woman
was
pacing
up
and
down
with
scared
look
and
restless
picking
fingers
but
the
sight
of
miss
morstan
appeared
to
have
soothing
effect
upon
her
god
bless
your
sweet
calm
face
she
cried
with
an
hysterical
sob
it
does
me
good
to
see
you
oh
but
have
been
sorely
tried
this
day
our
companion
patted
her
thin
work
worn
hand
and
murmured
some
few
words
of
kindly
womanly
comfort
which
brought
the
colour
back
into
the
other
bloodless
cheeks
master
has
locked
himself
in
and
will
not
answer
me
she
explained
all
day
have
waited
to
hear
from
him
for
he
often
likes
to
be
alone
but
an
hour
ago
feared
that
something
was
amiss
so
went
up
and
peeped
through
the
keyhole
you
must
go
up
mr
thaddeus
you
must
go
up
and
look
for
yourself
have
seen
mr
bartholomew
sholto
in
joy
and
in
sorrow
for
ten
long
years
but
never
saw
him
with
such
face
on
him
as
that
sherlock
holmes
took
the
lamp
and
led
the
way
for
thaddeus
sholto
teeth
were
chattering
in
his
head
so
shaken
was
he
that
had
to
pass
my
hand
under
his
arm
as
we
went
up
the
stairs
for
his
knees
were
trembling
under
him
twice
as
we
ascended
holmes
whipped
his
lens
out
of
his
pocket
and
carefully
examined
marks
which
appeared
to
me
to
be
mere
shapeless
smudges
of
dust
upon
the
cocoanut
matting
which
served
as
stair
carpet
he
walked
slowly
from
step
to
step
holding
the
lamp
and
shooting
keen
glances
to
right
and
left
miss
morstan
had
remained
behind
with
the
frightened
housekeeper
the
third
flight
of
stairs
ended
in
straight
passage
of
some
length
with
great
picture
in
indian
tapestry
upon
the
right
of
it
and
three
doors
upon
the
left
holmes
advanced
along
it
in
the
same
slow
and
methodical
way
while
we
kept
close
at
his
heels
with
our
long
black
shadows
streaming
backwards
down
the
corridor
the
third
door
was
that
which
we
were
seeking
holmes
knocked
without
receiving
any
answer
and
then
tried
to
turn
the
handle
and
force
it
open
it
was
locked
on
the
inside
however
and
by
broad
and
powerful
bolt
as
we
could
see
when
we
set
our
lamp
up
against
it
the
key
being
turned
however
the
hole
was
not
entirely
closed
sherlock
holmes
bent
down
to
it
and
instantly
rose
again
with
sharp
intaking
of
the
breath
there
is
something
devilish
in
this
watson
said
he
more
moved
than
had
ever
before
seen
him
what
do
you
make
of
it
stooped
to
the
hole
and
recoiled
in
horror
moonlight
was
streaming
into
the
room
and
it
was
bright
with
vague
and
shifty
radiance
looking
straight
at
me
and
suspended
as
it
were
in
the
air
for
all
beneath
was
in
shadow
there
hung
face
the
very
face
of
our
companion
thaddeus
there
was
the
same
high
shining
head
the
same
circular
bristle
of
red
hair
the
same
bloodless
countenance
the
features
were
set
however
in
horrible
smile
fixed
and
unnatural
grin
which
in
that
still
and
moonlit
room
was
more
jarring
to
the
nerves
than
any
scowl
or
contortion
so
like
was
the
face
to
that
of
our
little
friend
that
looked
round
at
him
to
make
sure
that
he
was
indeed
with
us
then
recalled
to
mind
that
he
had
mentioned
to
us
that
his
brother
and
he
were
twins
this
is
terrible
said
to
holmes
what
is
to
be
done
the
door
must
come
down
he
answered
and
springing
against
it
he
put
all
his
weight
upon
the
lock
it
creaked
and
groaned
but
did
not
yield
together
we
flung
ourselves
upon
it
once
more
and
this
time
it
gave
way
with
sudden
snap
and
we
found
ourselves
within
bartholomew
sholto
chamber
it
appeared
to
have
been
fitted
up
as
chemical
laboratory
double
line
of
glass
stoppered
bottles
was
drawn
up
upon
the
wall
opposite
the
door
and
the
table
was
littered
over
with
bunsen
burners
test
tubes
and
retorts
in
the
corners
stood
carboys
of
acid
in
wicker
baskets
one
of
these
appeared
to
leak
or
to
have
been
broken
for
stream
of
dark
coloured
liquid
had
trickled
out
from
it
and
the
air
was
heavy
with
peculiarly
pungent
tar
like
odour
set
of
steps
stood
at
one
side
of
the
room
in
the
midst
of
litter
of
lath
and
plaster
and
above
them
there
was
an
opening
in
the
ceiling
large
enough
for
man
to
pass
through
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
long
coil
of
rope
was
thrown
carelessly
together
by
the
table
in
wooden
armchair
the
master
of
the
house
was
seated
all
in
heap
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
left
shoulder
and
that
ghastly
inscrutable
smile
upon
his
face
he
was
stiff
and
cold
and
had
clearly
been
dead
many
hours
it
seemed
to
me
that
not
only
his
features
but
all
his
limbs
were
twisted
and
turned
in
the
most
fantastic
fashion
by
his
hand
upon
the
table
there
lay
peculiar
instrument
brown
close
grained
stick
with
stone
head
like
hammer
rudely
lashed
on
with
coarse
twine
beside
it
was
torn
sheet
of
note
paper
with
some
words
scrawled
upon
it
holmes
glanced
at
it
and
then
handed
it
to
me
you
see
he
said
with
significant
raising
of
the
eyebrows
in
the
light
of
the
lantern
read
with
thrill
of
horror
the
sign
of
the
four
in
god
name
what
does
it
all
mean
asked
it
means
murder
said
he
stooping
over
the
dead
man
ah
expected
it
look
here
he
pointed
to
what
looked
like
long
dark
thorn
stuck
in
the
skin
just
above
the
ear
it
looks
like
thorn
said
it
is
thorn
you
may
pick
it
out
but
be
careful
for
it
is
poisoned
took
it
up
between
my
finger
and
thumb
it
came
away
from
the
skin
so
readily
that
hardly
any
mark
was
left
behind
one
tiny
speck
of
blood
showed
where
the
puncture
had
been
this
is
all
an
insoluble
mystery
to
me
said
it
grows
darker
instead
of
clearer
on
the
contrary
he
answered
it
clears
every
instant
only
require
few
missing
links
to
have
an
entirely
connected
case
we
had
almost
forgotten
our
companion
presence
since
we
entered
the
chamber
he
was
still
standing
in
the
doorway
the
very
picture
of
terror
wringing
his
hands
and
moaning
to
himself
suddenly
however
he
broke
out
into
sharp
querulous
cry
the
treasure
is
gone
he
said
they
have
robbed
him
of
the
treasure
there
is
the
hole
through
which
we
lowered
it
helped
him
to
do
it
was
the
last
person
who
saw
him
left
him
here
last
night
and
heard
him
lock
the
door
as
came
downstairs
what
time
was
that
it
was
ten
clock
and
now
he
is
dead
and
the
police
will
be
called
in
and
shall
be
suspected
of
having
had
hand
in
it
oh
yes
am
sure
shall
but
you
don
think
so
gentlemen
surely
you
don
think
that
it
was
is
it
likely
that
would
have
brought
you
here
if
it
were
oh
dear
oh
dear
know
that
shall
go
mad
he
jerked
his
arms
and
stamped
his
feet
in
kind
of
convulsive
frenzy
you
have
no
reason
for
fear
mr
sholto
said
holmes
kindly
putting
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
take
my
advice
and
drive
down
to
the
station
to
report
this
matter
to
the
police
offer
to
assist
them
in
every
way
we
shall
wait
here
until
your
return
the
little
man
obeyed
in
half
stupefied
fashion
and
we
heard
him

down
the
stairs
in
the
dark

holmes
rubbing
his
hands
we
have
half
an
hour
to
ourselves
let
us
make
good
use
of
it
my
case
is
as
have
told
you
almost
complete
but
we
must
not
err
on
the
side
of
over
confidence
simple
as
the
case
seems
now
there
may
be
something
deeper
underlying
it

he

something

in
the
corner
there
that
your

did
these

come
and
how
did
they
go
the
door
has
not
been
opened
since
last
night
how
of
the
window
he
carried
the
lamp
across
to

his
observations
aloud

while

addressing
them
to
himself

looked
at
the
round
well
defined
muddy
discs
this
is
not
footmark
said
it
is
something
much
more
valuable
to
us
it
is
the
impression
of
wooden
stump
you
see
here
on
the
sill
is
the
boot
mark
heavy
boot
with
the
broad
metal
heel
and
beside
it
is
the
mark
of
the
timber
toe
it
is
the
wooden
legged
man
quite
so
but
there
has
been
some
one
else
very
able
and
efficient
ally
could
you
scale
that
wall
doctor
looked
out
of
the
open
window
the
moon
still
shone
brightly
on
that
angle
of
the
house
we
were
good
sixty
feet
from
the
round
and
look
where
would
could
see
no
foothold
nor
as
much
as
crevice
in
the
brickwork
it
is
absolutely
impossible
answered
without
aid
it
is
so
but
suppose
you
had
friend
up
here
who
lowered
you
this
good
stout
rope
which
see
in
the
corner
securing
one
end
of
it
to
this
great
hook
in
the
wall
then
think
if
you
were
an
active
man
you
might
swarm
up
wooden
leg
and
all
you
would
depart
of
course
in
the
same
fashion
and
your
ally
would
draw
up
the
rope
untie
it
from
the
hook
shut
the
window
snib
it
on
the
inside
and
get
away
in
the
way
that
he
originally
came
as
minor
point
it
may
be
noted
he
continued
fingering
the
rope
that
our
wooden
legged
friend
though
fair
climber
was
not
professional
sailor
his
hands
were
far
from
horny
my
lens
discloses
more
than
one
blood
mark
especially
towards
the
end
of
the
rope
from
which
gather
that
he
slipped
down
with
such
velocity
that
he
took
the
skin
off
his
hands
this
is
all
very
well
said
but
the
thing
becomes
more
unintelligible
than
ever
how
about
this
mysterious
ally
how
came
he
into
the
room
yes
the
ally
repeated
holmes
pensively
there
are
features
of
interest
about
this
ally
he
lifts
the
case
from
the
regions
of
the
commonplace
fancy
that
this
ally
breaks
fresh
ground
in
the
annals
of
crime
in
this
country
though
parallel
cases
suggest
themselves
from
india
and
if
my
memory
serves
me
from
senegambia
how
came
he
then
reiterated
the
door
is
locked
the
window
is
inaccessible
was
it
through
the
chimney
the
grate
is
much
too
small
he
answered
had
already
considered
that
possibility
how
then
persisted
you
will
not
apply
my
precept
he
said
shaking
his
head
how
often
have
said
to
you
that
when
you
have
eliminated
the
impossible
whatever
remains
however
improbable
must
be
the
truth
we
know
that
he
did
not
come
through
the
door
the
window
or
the
chimney
we
also
know
that
he
could
not
have
been
concealed
in
the
room
as
there
is
no
concealment
possible
whence
then
did
he
come
he
came
through
the
hole
in
the
roof
cried
of
course
he
did
he
must
have
done
so
if
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
hold
the
lamp
for
me
we
shall
now
extend
our
researches
to
the
room
above
the
secret
room
in
which
the
treasure
was
found
he
mounted
the
steps
and
seizing
rafter
with
either
hand
he
swung
himself
up
into
the
garret
then
lying
on
his
face
he
reached
down
for
the
lamp
and
held
it
while
followed
him
the
chamber
in
which
we
found
ourselves
was
about
ten
feet
one
way
and
six
the
other
the
floor
was
formed
by
the
rafters
with
thin
lath
and
plaster
between
so
that
in
walking
one
had
to
step
from
beam
to
beam
the
roof
ran
up
to
an
apex
and
was
evidently
the
inner
shell
of
the
true
roof
of
the
house
there
was
no
furniture
of
any
sort
and
the
accumulated
dust
of
years
lay
thick
upon
the
floor
here
you
are
you
see
said
sherlock
holmes
putting
his
hand
against
the
sloping
wall
this
is
trapdoor
which
leads
out
on
to
the
roof
can
press
it
back
and
here
is
the
roof
itself
sloping
at
gentle
angle
this
then
is
the
way
by
which
number
one
entered
let
us
see
if
we
can
find
some
other
traces
of
his
individuality
he
held
down
the
lamp
to
the
floor
and
as
he
did
so
saw
for
the
second
time
that
night
startled
surprised
look
come
over
his
face
for
myself
as
followed
his
gaze
my
skin
was
cold
under
my
clothes
the
floor
was
covered
thickly
with
the
prints
of
naked
foot
clear
well
defined
perfectly
formed
but
scarce
half
the
size
of
those
of
an
ordinary
man
holmes
said
in
whisper
child
has
done
this
horrid
thing
he
had
recovered
his
self
possession
in
an
instant
was
staggered
for
the
moment
he
said
but
the
thing
is
quite
natural
my
memory
failed
me
or
should
have
been
able
to
foretell
it
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
learned
here
let
us
go
down
what
is
your
theory
then
as
to
those
footmarks
asked
eagerly
when
we
had
regained
the
lower
room
once
more
my
dear
watson
try
little
analysis
yourself
said
he
with
touch
of
impatience
you
know
my
methods
apply
them
and
it
will
be
instructive
to
compare
results
cannot
conceive
anything
which
will
cover
the
facts
answered
it
will
be
clear
enough
to
you
soon
he
said
in
an
offhand
way
think
that
there
is
nothing
else
of
importance
here
but
will
look
he
whipped
out
his
lens
and
tape
measure
and
hurried
about
the
room
on
his
knees
measuring
comparing
examining
with
his
long
thin
nose
only
few
inches
from
the
planks
and
his
beady
eyes
gleaming
and
deep
set
like
those
of
bird
so
swift
silent
and
furtive
were
his
movements
like
those
of
trained
bloodhound
picking
out
scent
that
could
not
but
think
what
terrible
criminal
he
would
have
made
had
he
turned
his
energy
and
sagacity
against
the
law
instead
of
exerting
them
in
its
defense
as
he
hunted
about
he
kept
muttering
to
himself
and
finally
he
broke
out
into
loud
crow
of
delight
we
are
certainly
in
luck
said
he
we
ought
to
have
very
little
trouble
now
number
one
has
had
the
misfortune
to
tread
in
the
creosote
you
can
see
the
outline
of
the
edge
of
his
small
foot
here
at
the
side
of
this
evil
smelling
mess
the
carboy
has
been
cracked
you
see
and
the
stuff
has
leaked
out
what
then
asked
why
we
have
got
him
that
all
said
he
know
dog
that
would
follow
that
scent
to
the
world
end
if
pack
can
track
trailed
herring
across
shire
how
far
can
specially
trained
hound
follow
so
pungent
smell
as
this
it
sounds
like
sum
in
the
rule
of
three
the
answer
should
give
us
the
but
halloo
here
are
the
accredited
representatives
of
the
law
heavy
steps
and
the
clamour
of
loud
voices
were
audible
from
below
and
the
hall
door
shut
with
loud
crash
before
they
come
said
holmes
just
put
your
hand
here
on
this
poor
fellow
arm
and
here
on
his
leg
what
do
you
feel
the
muscles
are
as
hard
as
board
answered
quite
so
they
are
in
state
of
extreme
contraction
far
exceeding
the
usual
rigor
mortis
coupled
with
this
distortion
of
the
face
this
hippocratic
smile
or
risus
sardonicus
as
the
old
writers
called
it
what
conclusion
would
it
suggest
to
your
mind
death
from
some
powerful
vegetable
alkaloid
answered
some
strychnine
like
substance
which
would
produce
tetanus
that
was
the
idea
which
occurred
to
me
the
instant
saw
the
drawn
muscles
of
the
face
on
getting
into
the
room
at
once
looked
for
the
means
by
which
the
poison
had
entered
the
system
as
you
saw
discovered
thorn
which
had
been
driven
or
shot
with
no
great
force
into
the
scalp
you
observe
that
the
part
struck
was
that
which
would
be
turned
towards
the
hole
in
the
ceiling
if
the
man
were
erect
in
his
chair
now
examine
the
thorn
took
it
up
gingerly
and
held
it
in
the
light
of
the
lantern
it
was
long
sharp
and
black
with
glazed
look
near
the
point
as
though
some
gummy
substance
had
dried
upon
it
the
blunt
end
had
been
trimmed
and
rounded
off
with
knife
is
that
an
english
thorn
he
asked
no
it
certainly
is
not
with
all
these
data
you
should
be
able
to
draw
some
just
inference
but
here
are
the
regulars
so
the
auxiliary
forces
may
beat
retreat
as
he
spoke
the
steps
which
had
been
coming
nearer
sounded
loudly
on
the
passage
and
very
stout
portly
man
in
grey
suit
strode
heavily
into
the
room
he
was
red
faced
burly
and
plethoric
with
pair
of
very
small
twinkling
eyes
which
looked
keenly
out
from
between
swollen
and
puffy
pouches
he
was
closely
followed
by
an
inspector
in
uniform
and
by
the
still
palpitating
thaddeus
sholto
here
business
he
cried
in
muffled
husky
voice
here
pretty
business
but
who
are
all
these
why
the
house
seems
to
be
as
full
as
rabbit
warren
think
you
must
recollect
me
mr
athelney
jones
said
holmes
quietly
why
of
course
do
he
wheezed
it
mr
sherlock
holmes
the
theorist
remember
you
ll
never
forget
how
you
lectured
us
all
on
causes
and
inferences
and
effects
in
the
bishopgate
jewel
case
it
true
you
set
us
on
the
right
track
but
you
ll
own
now
that
it
was
more
by
good
luck
than
good
guidance

it
was
piece
of
very
simple
reasoning
oh
come
now
come
never
be
ashamed
to
own
up
but
what
is
all
this
bad
business
bad
business
stern
facts
here
no
room
for
theories
how
lucky
that
happened
to
be
out
at
norwood
over
another
case
was
at
the
station
when
the
message
arrived
what
you
think
the
man
died
of
oh
this
is
hardly
case
for
me
to
theorize
over
said
holmes
dryly
no
still
we
can
deny
that
you
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
sometimes
dear
me
door
locked
understand
jewels
worth
half
million
missing
how
was
the
window
fastened
but
there
are
steps
on
the
sill
well
if
it
was
fastened
the
steps
could
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
that
common
sense
man
might
have
died
in
fit
but
then
the
jewels
are
missing
ha
have
theory
these
flashes
come
upon
me
at
times
just
step
outside
sergeant
and
you
mr
sholto
your
friend
can
remain
what
do
you
think
of
this
holmes
sholto
was
on
his
own
confession
with
his
brother
last
night
the
brother
died
in
fit
on
which
sholto
walked
off
with
the
treasure
how
that
on
which
the
dead
man
very
considerately
got
up
and
locked
the
door
on
the
inside
hum
there
flaw
there
let
us
apply
common
sense
to
the
matter
this
thaddeus
sholto
was
with
his
brother
there
was
quarrel
so
much
we
know
the
brother
is
dead
and
the
jewels
are
gone
so
much
also
we
know
no
one
saw
the
brother
from
the
time
thaddeus
left
him
his
bed
had
not
been
slept
in
thaddeus
is
evidently
in
most
disturbed
state
of
mind
his
appearance
is
well
not
attractive
you
see
that
am
weaving
my
web
round
thaddeus
the
net
begins
to
close
upon
him
you
are
not
quite
in
possession
of
the
facts
yet
said
holmes
this
splinter
of
wood
which
have
every
reason
to
believe
to
be
poisoned
was
in
the
man
scalp
where
you
still
see
the
mark
this
card
inscribed
as
you
see
it
was
on
the
table
and
beside
it
lay
this
rather
curious
stone
headed
instrument
how
does
all
that
fit
into
your
theory
confirms
it
in
every
respect
said
the
fat
detective
pompously
house
is
full
of
indian
curiosities
thaddeus
brought
this
up
and
if
this
splinter
be
poisonous
thaddeus
may
as
well
have
made
murderous
use
of
it
as
any
other
man
the
card
is
some
hocus
pocus
blind
as
like
as
not
the
only
question
is
how
did
he
depart
ah
of
course
here
is
hole
in
the
roof
with
great
activity
considering
his
bulk
he
sprang
up
the
steps
and
squeezed
through
into
the
garret
and
immediately
afterwards
we
heard
his
exulting
voice
proclaiming
that
he
had
found
the
trap
door
he
can
find
something
remarked
holmes
shrugging
his
shoulders
he
has
occasional
glimmerings
of
reason

you
see
said
athelney
jones
reappearing
down
the
steps
again
facts
are
better
than
mere
theories
after
all
my
view
of
the
case
is
confirmed
there
is
trap
door
communicating
with
the
roof
and
it
is
partly
open
it
was
who
opened
it
oh
indeed
you
did
notice
it
then
he
seemed
little
crestfallen
at
the
discovery
well
whoever
noticed
it
shows
how
our
gentleman
got
away
inspector
yes
sir
from
the
passage
ask
mr
sholto
to
step
this
way
mr
sholto
it
is
my
duty
to
inform
you
that
anything
which
you
may
say
will
be
used
against
you
arrest
you
in
the
queen
name
as
being
concerned
in
the
death
of
your
brother
there
now
didn
tell
you
cried
the
poor
little
man
throwing
out
his
hands
and
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
don
trouble
yourself
about
it
mr
sholto
said
holmes
think
that
can
engage
to
clear
you
of
the
charge
don
promise
too
much
mr
theorist
don
promise
too
much
snapped
the
detective
you
may
find
it
harder
matter
than
you
think
not
only
will
clear
him
mr
jones
but
will
make
you
free
present
of
the
name
and
description
of
one
of
the
two
people
who
were
in
this
room
last
night
his
name
have
every
reason
to
believe
is
jonathan
small
he
is
poorly
educated
man
small
active
with
his
right
leg
off
and
wearing
wooden
stump
which
is
worn
away
upon
the
inner
side
his
left
boot
has
coarse
square
toed
sole
with
an
iron
band
round
the
heel
he
is
middle
aged
man
much
sunburned
and
has
been
convict
these
few
indications
may
be
of
some
assistance
to
you
coupled
with
the
fact
that
there
is
good
deal
of
skin
missing
from
the
palm
of
his
hand
the
other
man—
ah
the
other
man—
asked
athelney
jones
in
sneering
voice
but
impressed
none
the
less
as
could
easily
see
by
the
precision
of
the
other
manner
is
rather
curious
person
said
sherlock
holmes
turning
upon
his
heel
hope
before
very
long
to
be
able
to
introduce
you
to
the
pair
of
them
word
with
you
watson
he
led
me
out
to
the
head
of
the
stair
this
unexpected
occurrence
he
said
has
caused
us
rather
to
lose
sight
of
the
original
purpose
of
our
journey
have
just
been
thinking
so
answered
it
is
not
right
that
miss
morstan
should
remain
in
this
stricken
house
no
you
must
escort
her
home
she
lives
with
mrs
cecil
forrester
in
lower
camberwell
so
it
is
not
very
far
will
wait
for
you
here
if
you
will
drive
out
again
or
perhaps
you
are
too
tired
by
no
means
don
think
could
rest
until
know
more
of
this
fantastic
business
have
seen
something
of
the
rough
side
of
life
but
give
you
my
word
that
this
quick
succession
of
strange
surprises
to
night
has
shaken
my
nerve
completely
should
like
however
to
see
the
matter
through
with
you
now
that
have
got
so
far
your
presence
will
be
of
great
service
to
me
he
answered
we
shall
work
the
case
out
independently
and
leave
this
fellow
jones
to
exult
over
any
mare
nest
which
he
may
choose
to
construct
when
you
have
dropped
miss
morstan
wish
you
to
go
on
to
no
pinchin
lane
down
near
the
water
edge
at
lambeth
the
third
house
on
the
right
hand
side
is
bird
stuffer
sherman
is
the
name
you
will
see
weasel
holding
young
rabbit
in
the
window
knock
old
sherman
up
and
tell
him
with
my
compliments
that
want
toby
at
once
you
will
bring
toby
back
in
the
cab
with
you
dog
suppose
yes
queer
mongrel
with
most
amazing
power
of
scent
would
rather
have
toby
help
than
that
of
the
whole
detective
force
of
london
shall
bring
him
then
said
it
is
one
now
ought
to
be
back
before
three
if
can
get
fresh
horse
and
said
holmes
shall
see
what
can
learn
from
mrs
bernstone
and
from
the
indian
servant
who
mr
thaddeus
tell
me
sleeps
in
the
next
garret
then
shall
study
the
great
jones
methods
and
listen
to
his
not
too
delicate
sarcasms

the
episode
of
the
barrel
the
police
had
brought
cab
with
them
and
in
this
escorted
miss
morstan
back
to
her
home
after
the
angelic
fashion
of
women
she
had
borne
trouble
with
calm
face
as
long
as
there
was
some
one
weaker
than
herself
to
support
and
had
found
her
bright
and
placid
by
the
side
of
the
frightened
housekeeper
in
the
cab
however
she
first
turned
faint
and
then
burst
into
passion
of
weeping
so
sorely
had
she
been
tried
by
the
adventures
of
the
night
she
has
told
me
since
that
she
thought
me
cold
and
distant
upon
that
journey
she
little
guessed
the
struggle
within
my
breast
or
the
effort
of
self
restraint
which
held
me
back
my
sympathies
and
my
love
went
out
to
her
even
as
my
hand
had
in
the
garden
felt
that
years
of
the
conventionalities
of
life
could
not
teach
me
to
know
her
sweet
brave
nature
as
had
this
one
day
of
strange
experiences
yet
there
were
two
thoughts
which
sealed
the
words
of
affection
upon
my
lips
she
was
weak
and
helpless
shaken
in
mind
and
nerve
it
was
to
take
her
at
disadvantage
to
obtrude
love
upon
her
at
such
time
worse
still
she
was
rich
if
holmes
researches
were
successful
she
would
be
an
heiress
was
it
fair
was
it
honourable
that
half
pay
surgeon
should
take
such
advantage
of
an
intimacy
which
chance
had
brought
about
might
she
not
look
upon
me
as
mere
vulgar
fortune
seeker
could
not
bear
to
risk
that
such
thought
should
cross
her
mind
this
agra
treasure
intervened
like
an
impassable
barrier
between
us
it
was
nearly
two
clock
when
we
reached
mrs
cecil
forrester
the
servants
had
retired
hours
ago
but
mrs
forrester
had
been
so
interested
by
the
strange
message
which
miss
morstan
had
received
that
she
had
sat
up
in
the
hope
of
her
return
she
opened
the
door
herself
middle
aged
graceful
woman
and
it
gave
me
joy
to
see
how
tenderly
her
arm
stole
round
the
other
waist
and
how
motherly
was
the
voice
in
which
she
greeted
her
she
was
clearly
no
mere
paid
dependant
but
an
honoured
friend
was
introduced
and
mrs
forrester
earnestly
begged
me
to
step
in
and
tell
her
our
adventures
explained
however
the
importance
of
my
errand
and
promised
faithfully
to
call
and
report
any
progress
which
we
might
make
with
the
case
as
we
drove
away
stole
glance
back
and
still
seem
to
see
that
little
group
on
the
step
the
two
graceful
clinging
figures
the
half
opened
door
the
hall
light
shining
through
stained
glass
the
barometer
and
the
bright
stair
rods
it
was
soothing
to
catch
even
that
passing
glimpse
of
tranquil
english
home
in
the
midst
of
the
wild
dark
business
which
had
absorbed
us

and
the
more
thought
of
what
had
happened
the
wilder
and
darker
it
grew
reviewed
the
whole
extraordinary
sequence
of
events
as
rattled
on
through
the
silent
gas
lit
streets
there
was
the
original
problem
that
at
least
was
pretty
clear
now
the
death
of
captain
morstan
the
sending
of
the
pearls
the
advertisement
the
letter
we
had
light
upon
all
those
events
they
had
only
led
us
however
to
deeper
and
far
more
tragic
mystery
the
indian
treasure
the
curious
plan
found
among
morstan
baggage
the
strange
scene
at
major
sholto
death
the
rediscovery
of
the
treasure
immediately
followed
by
the
murder
of
the
discoverer
the
very
singular
accompaniments
to
the
crime
the
footsteps
the
remarkable
weapons
the
words
upon
the
card
corresponding
with
those
upon
captain
morstan
chart
here
was
indeed
labyrinth
in
which
man
less
singularly
endowed
than
my
fellow
lodger
might
well
despair
of
ever
finding
the
clue
pinchin
lane
was
row
of
shabby
two
storied
brick
houses
in
the
lower
quarter
of
lambeth
had
to
knock
for
some
time
at
no
before
could
make
any
impression
at
last
however
there
was
the
glint
of
candle
behind
the
blind
and
face
looked
out
at
the
upper
window

mr
sherlock
holmes—
began
but
the
words
had
most
magical
effect
for
the
window
instantly
slammed
down
and
within
minute
the
door
was
unbarred
and
open
mr
sherman
was
lanky
lean
old
man
with
stooping
shoulders
stringy
neck
and
bluetinted
glasses
friend

mr
sherlock

ah
that
would
be
toby
yes
toby
was
the
name
toby
lives
at
no
on
the
left
here
he
moved
slowly
forward
with
his
candle
among
the
queer
animal
family
which
he
had
gathered
round
him
in
the
uncertain
shadowy
light
could
see
dimly
that
there
were
glancing
glimmering
eyes
peeping
down
at
us
from
every
cranny
and
corner
even
the
rafters
above
our
heads
were
lined
by
solemn
fowls
who
lazily
shifted
their
weight
from
one
leg
to
the
other
as
our
voices
disturbed
their
slumbers
toby
proved
to
an
ugly
long
haired
lop
eared
creature
half
spaniel
and
half
lurcher
brown
and
white
in
colour
with
very
clumsy
waddling
gait
it
accepted
after
some
hesitation
lump
of
sugar
which
the
old
naturalist
handed
to
me
and
having
thus
sealed
an
alliance
it
followed
me
to
the
cab
and
made
no
difficulties
about
accompanying
me
it
had
just
struck
three
on
the
palace
clock
when
found
myself
back
once
more
at
pondicherry
lodge
the
ex
prize
fighter
mcMurdo
had
found
been
arrested
as
an
accessory
and
both
he
and
mr
sholto
had
been
marched
off
to
the
station
two
constables
guarded
the
narrow
gate
but
they
allowed
me
to
pass
with
the
dog
on
my
mentioning
the
detective
name
holmes
was
standing
on
the
doorstep
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
smoking
his
pipe
ah
you
have
him
there
said
he
good
dog
then
atheney
jones
has
gone
we
have
had
an
immense
display
of
energy
since
you
left
he
has
arrested
not
only
friend
thaddeus
but
the
gatekeeper
the
housekeeper
and
the
indian
servant
we
have
the
place
to
ourselves
but
for
sergeant
upstairs
leave
the
dog
here
and
come
up
we
tied
toby
to
the
hall
table
and
reascended
the
stairs
the
room
was
as
he
had
left
it
save
that
sheet
had
been
draped
over
the
central
figure
weary
looking
police
sergeant
reclined
in
the
corner
lend
me
your
bull
eye
sergeant
said
my
companion
now
tie
this
bit
of
cord
round
my
neck
so
as
to
hang
it
in
front
of
me
thank
you
now
must
kick
off
my
boots
and
stockings
just
you
carry
them
down
with
you
watson
am
going
to
do
little
climbing
and
dip
my
handkerchief
into
the
creosote
that
will
do
now
come
up
into
the
garret
with
me
for
moment
we
clambered
up
through
the
hole
holmes
turned
his
light
once
more
upon
the
footsteps
in
the
dust
wish
you
particularly
to
notice
these
footmarks
he
said
do
you
observe
anything
noteworthy
about
them
they
belong
said
to
child
or
small
woman
apart
from
their
size
though
is
there
nothing
else
they
appear
to
be
much
as
other
footmarks
not
at
all
look
here
this
is
the
print
of
right
foot
in
the
dust
now
make
one
with
my
naked
foot
beside
it
what
is
the
chief
difference
your
toes
are
all
cramped
together
the
other
print
has
each
toe
distinctly
divided
quite
so
that
is
the
point
bear
that
in
mind
now
would
you
kindly
step
over
to
that
flap
window
and
smell
the
edge
of
the
wood
work
shall
stay
here
as
have
this
handkerchief
in
my
hand
did
as
he
directed
and
was
instantly
conscious
of
strong
tarry
smell
that
is
where
he
put
his
foot
in
getting
out
if
you
can
trace
him
should
think
that
toby
will
have
no
difficulty
now
run
down
stairs
loose
the
dog
and
look
out
for
blondin
by
the
time
that
got
out
into
the
grounds
sherlock
holmes
was
on
the
roof
and
could
see
him
like
an
enormous
glow
worm
crawling
very
slowly
along
the
ridge
lost
sight
of
him
behind
stack
of
chimneys
but
he
presently
reappeared
and
then
vanished
once
more
upon
the
opposite
side
when
made
my
way
round
there
found
him
seated
at
one
of
the
corner
eaves
that
you
watson
he
cried
yes
this
is
the
place
what
is
that
black
thing
down
there
water
barrel
top
on
it
yes
no
sign
of
ladder
no
confound
the
fellow
it
most
breakneck
place
ought
to
be
able
to
come
down
where
he
could
climb
up
the
water
pipe
feels
pretty
firm
here
goes
anyhow
there
was
scuffling
of
feet
and
the
lantern
began
to
come
steadily
down
the
side
of
the
wall
then
with
light
spring
he
came
on
to
the
barrel
and
from
there
to
the
earth
it
was
easy
to
follow
him
he
said
drawing
on
his
stockings
and
boots
tiles
were
loosened
the
whole
way
along
and
in
his
hurry
he
had
dropped
this
it
confirms
my
diagnosis
as
you
doctors
express
it
the
object
which
he
held
up
to
me
was
small
pocket
or
pouch
woven
out
of
coloured
grasses
and
with
few
tawdry
beads
strung
round
it
in
shape
and
size
it
was
not
unlike
cigarette
case
inside
were
half
dozen
spines
of
dark
wood
sharp
at
one
end
and
rounded
at
the
other
like
that
which
had
struck
bartholomew
sholto
they
are
hellish
things
said
he
look
out
that
you
don
prick
yourself
delighted
to
have
them
for
the
chances
are
that
they
are
all
he
has
there
is
the
less
fear
of
you
or
me
finding
one
in
our
skin
before
long
would
sooner
face
martini
bullet
myself
are
you
game
for
six
mile
trudge
watson
certainly
answered
your
leg
will
stand
it
oh
yes
here
you
are
doggy
good
old
toby
smell
it
toby
smell
it
he
pushed
the
creosote
handkerchief
under
the
dog
nose
while
the
creature
stood
with
its
fluffy
legs
separated
and
with
most
comical
cock
to
its
head
like
connoisseur
sniffing
the
bouquet
of
famous
vintage
holmes
then
threw
the
handkerchief
to
distance
fastened
stout
cord
to
the
mongrel
collar
and
led
him
to
the
foot
of
the
water
barrel
the
creature
instantly
broke
into
succession
of
high
tremulous
yelps
and
with
his
nose
on
the
ground
and
his
tail
in
the
air
pattered
off
upon
the
trail
at
pace
which
strained
his
leash
and
kept
us
at
the
top
of
our
speed
the
east
had
been
gradually
whitening
and
we
could
now
see
some
distance
in
the
cold
grey
light
the
square
massive
house
with
its
black
empty
windows
and
high
bare
walls
towered
up
sad
and
forlorn
behind
us
our
course
let
right
across
the
grounds
in
and
out
among
the
trenches
and
pits
with
which
they
were
scarred
and
intersected
the
whole
place
with
its
scattered
dirt
heaps
and
ill
grown
shrubs
had
blighted
ill
omened
look
which
harmonized
with
the
black
tragedy
which
hung
over
it

on
reaching
the
boundary
wall
toby
ran
along
whining
eagerly
underneath
its
shadow
and
stopped
finally
in
corner
screened
by
young
beech
where
the
two
walls
joined
several
bricks
had
been
loosened
and
the
crevices
left
were
worn
down
and
rounded
upon
the
lower
side
as
though
they
had
frequently
been
used
as
ladder
holmes
clambered
up
and
taking
the
dog
from
me
he
dropped
it
over
upon
the
other
side
there
the
print
of
wooden
leg
hand
he
remarked
as
mounted
up
beside
him
you
see
the
slight
smudge
of
blood
upon
the
white
plaster
what
lucky
thing
it
is
that
we
have
had
no
very
heavy
rain
since
yesterday
the
scent
will
lie
upon
the
road
in
spite
of
their
eight
and
twenty
hours
start
confess
that
had
my
doubts
myself
when
reflected
upon
the
great
traffic
which
had
passed
along
the
london
road
in
the
interval
my
fears
were
soon
appeased
however
toby
never
hesitated
or
swerved
but
waddled
on
in
his
peculiar
rolling
fashion
clearly
the
pungent
smell
of
the
creosote
rose
high
above
all
other
contending
scents
do
not
imagine
said
holmes
that
depend
for
my
success
in
this
case
upon
the
mere
chance
of
one
of
these
fellows
having
put
his
foot
in
the
chemical
have
knowledge
now
which
would
enable
me
to
trace
them
in
many
different
ways
this
however
is
the
readiest
and
since
fortune
has
put
it
into
our
hands
should
be
culpable
if
neglected
it
has
however
prevented
the
case
from
becoming
the
pretty
little
intellectual
problem
which
it
at
one
time
promised
to
be
there
might
have
been
some
credit
to
be
gained
out
of
it
but
for
this
too
palpable
clue
there
is
credit
and
to
spare
said
assure
you
holmes
that
marvel
at
the
means
by
which
you
obtain
your
results
in
this
case
even
more
than
did
in
the
jefferson
hope
murder
the
thing
seems
to
me
to
be
deeper
and
more
inexplicable
how
for
example
could
you
describe
with
such
confidence
the
wooden
legged
man
pshaw
my
dear
boy
it
was
simplicity
itself
don
wish
to
be
theatrical
it
is
all
patent
and
above
board
two
officers
who
are
in
command
of
convict
guard
learn
an
important
secret
as
to
buried
treasure
map
is
drawn
for
them
by
an
englishman
named
jonathan
small
you
remember
that
we
saw
the
name
upon
the
chart
in
captain
morstan
possession
he
had
signed
it
in
behalf
of
himself
and
his
associates
the
sign
of
the
four
as
he
somewhat
dramatically
called
it
aided
by
this
chart
the
officers
or
one
of
them
gets
the
treasure
and
brings
it
to
england
leaving
we
will
suppose
some
condition
under
which
he
received
it
unfulfilled
now
then
why
did
not
jonathan
small
get
the
treasure
himself
the
answer
is
obvious
the
chart
is
dated
at
time
when
morstan
was
brought
into
close
association
with
convicts
jonathan
small
did
not
get
the
treasure
because
he
and
his
associates
were
themselves
convicts
and
could
not
get
away
but
this
is
mere
speculation
said
it
is
more
than
that
it
is
the
only
hypothesis
which
covers
the
facts
let
us
see
how
it
fits
in
with
the
sequel
major
sholto
remains
at
peace
for
some
years
happy
in
the
possession
of
his
treasure
then
he
receives
letter
from
india
which
gives
him
great
fright
what
was
that
letter
to
say
that
the
men
whom
he
had
wronged
had
been
set
free
or
had
escaped
that
is
much
more
likely
for
he
would
have
known
what
their
term
of
imprisonment
was
it
would
not
have
been
surprise
to
him
what
does
he
do
then
he
guards
himself
against
wooden
legged
man
white
man
mark
you
for
he
mistakes
white
tradesman
for
him
and
actually
fires
pistol
at
him
now
only
one
white
man
name
is
on
the
chart
the
others
are
hindoos
or
mohammedans
there
is
no
other
white
man
therefore
we
may
say
with
confidence
that
the
wooden
legged
man
is
identical
with
jonathan
small
does
the
reasoning
strike
yo
as
being
faulty
no
it
is
clear
and
concise
well
now
let
us
put
ourselves
in
the
place
of
jonathan
small
let
us
look
at
it
from
his
point
of
view
he
comes
to
england
with
the
double
idea
of
regaining
what
he
would
consider
to
be
his
rights
and
of
having
his
revenge
upon
the
man
who
had
wronged
him
he
found
out
where
sholto
lived
and
very
possibly
he
established
communications
with
some
one
inside
the
house
there
is
this
butler
lal
rao
whom
we
have
not
seen
mrs
bernstone
gives
him
far
from
good
character
small
could
not
find
out
however
where
the
treasure
was
hid
for
no
one
ever
knew
save
the
major
and
one
faithful
servant
who
had
died
suddenly
small
learns
that
the
major
is
on
his
death
bed
in
frenzy
lest
the
secret
of
the
treasure
die
with
him
he
runs
the
gauntlet
of
the
guards
makes
his
way
to
the
dying
man
window
and
is
only
deterred
from
entering
by
the
presence
of
his
two
sons
mad
with
hate
however
against
the
dead
man
he
enters
the
room
that
night
searches
his
private
papers
in
the
hope
of
discovering
some
memorandum
relating
to
the
treasure
and
finally
leaves
momento
of
his
visit
in
the
short
inscription
upon
the
card
he
had
doubtless
planned
beforehand
that
should
he
slay
the
major
he
would
leave
some
such
record
upon
the
body
as
sign
that
it
was
not
common
murder
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
four
associates
something
in
the
nature
of
an
act
of
justice
whimsical
and
bizarre
conceits
of
this
kind
are
common
enough
in
the
annals
of
crime
and
usually
afford
valuable
indications
as
to
the
criminal
do
you
follow
all
this
very
clearly
now
what
could
jonathan
small
do
he
could
only
continue
to
keep
secret
watch
upon
the
efforts
made
to
find
the
treasure
possibly
he
leaves
england
and
only
comes
back
at
intervals
then
comes
the
discovery
of
the
garret
and
he
is
instantly
informed
of
it
we
again
trace
the
presence
of
some
confederate
in
the
household
jonathan
with
his
wooden
leg
is
utterly
unable
to
reach
the
lofty
room
of
bartholomew
sholto
he
takes
with
him
however
rather
curious
associate
who
gets
over
this
difficulty
but
dips
his
naked
foot
into
creosote
whence
come
toby
and
six
mile
limp
for
half
pay
officer
with
damaged
tendo
achillis
but
it
was
the
associate
and
not
jonathan
who
committed
the
crime
quite
so
and
rather
to
jonathan
disgust
to
judge
by
the
way
the
stamped
about
when
he
got
into
the
room
he
bore
no
grudge
against
bartholomew
sholto
and
would
have
preferred
if
he
could
have
been
simply
bound
and
gagged
he
did
not
wish
to
put
his
head
in
halter
there
was
no
help
for
it
however
the
savage
instincts
of
his
companion
had
broken
out
and
the
poison
had
done
its
work
so
jonathan
small
left
his
record
lowered
the
treasure
box
to
the
ground
and
followed
it
himself
that
was
the
train
of
events
as
far
as
can
decipher
them
of
course
as
to
his
personal
appearance
he
must
be
middle
aged
and
must
be
sunburned
after
serving
his
time
in
such
an
oven
as
the
andamans
his
height
is
readily
calculated
from
the
length
of
his
stride
and
we
know
that
he
was
bearded
his
hairiness
was
the
one
point
which
impressed
itself
upon
thaddeus
sholto
when
he
saw
him
at
the
window
don
know
that
there
is
anything
else
the
associate
ah
well
there
is
no
great
mystery
in
that
but
you
will
know
all
about
it
soon
enough
how
sweet
the
morning
air
is
see
how
that
one
little
cloud
floats
like
pink
feather
from
some
gigantic
flamingo
now
the
red
rim
of
the
sun
pushes
itself
over
the
london
cloud
bank
it
shines
on
good
many
folk
but
on
none
dare
bet
who
are
on
stranger
errand
than
you
and
how
small
we
feel
with
our
petty
ambitions
and
strivings
in
the
presence
of
the
great
elemental
forces
of
nature
are
you
well
up
in
your
jean
paul
fairly
so
worked
back
to
him
through
carlyle
that
was
like
following
the
brook
to
the
parent
lake
he
makes
one
curious
but
profound
remark
it
is
that
the
chief
proof
of
man
real
greatness
lies
in
his
perception
of
his
own
smallness
it
argues
you
see
power
of
comparison
and
of
appreciation
which
is
in
itself
proof
of
nobility
there
is
much
food
for
thought
in
richter
you
have
not
pistol
have
you
have
my
stick
it
is
just
possible
that
we
may
need
something
of
the
sort
if
we
get
to
their
lair
jonathan
shall
leave
to
you
but
if
the
other
turns
nasty
shall
shoot
him
dead
he
took
out
his
revolver
as
he
spoke
and
having
loaded
two
of
the
chambers
he
put
it
back
into
the
right
hand
pocket
of
his
jacket
we
had
during
this
time
been
following
the
guidance
of
toby
down
the
half
rural
villa
lined
roads
which
lead
to
the
metropolis
now
however
we
were
beginning
to
come
among
continuous
streets
where
labourers
and
dockmen
were
already
astir
and
slatternly
women
were
taking
down
shutters
and
brushing
doorsteps
at
the
square
topped
corner
public
houses
business
was
just
beginning
and
rough
looking
men
were
emerging
rubbing
their
sleeves
across
their
beards
after
their
morning
wet
strange
dogs
sauntered
up
and
stared
wonderingly
at
us
as
we
passed
but
our
inimitable
toby
looked
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
but
trotted
onwards
with
his
nose
to
the
ground
and
an
occasional
eager
whine
which
spoke
of
hot
scent

we
had
traversed
streatham
brixton
camberwell
and
now
found
ourselves
in
kennington
lane
having
borne
away
through
the
sidestreets
to
the
east
of
the
oval
the
men
whom
we
pursued
seemed
to
have
taken
curiously
zig
zag
road
with
the
idea
probably
of
escaping
observation
they
had
never
kept
to
the
main
road
if
parallel
side
street
would
serve
their
turn
at
the
foot
of
kennington
lane
they
had
edged
away
to
the
left
through
bond
street
and
miles
street
where
the
latter
street
turns
into
knight
place
toby
ceased
to
advance
but
began
to
run
backwards
and
forwards
with
one
ear
cocked
and
the
other
drooping
the
very
picture
of
canine
indecision
then
he
waddled
round
in
circles
looking
up
to
us
from
time
to
time
as
if
to
ask
for
sympathy
in
his
embarrassment
what
the
deuce
is
the
matter
with
the
dog
growled
holmes
they
surely
would
not
take
cab
or
go
off
in
balloon
perhaps
they
stood
here
for
some
time
suggested
ah
it
all
right
he
off
again
said
my
companion
in
tone
of
relief
he
was
indeed
off
for
after
sniffing
round
again
he
suddenly
made
up
his
mind
and
darted
away
with
an
energy
and
determination
such
as
he
had
not
yet
shown
the
scent
appeared
to
be
much
hotter
than
before
for
he
had
not
even
to
put
his
nose
on
the
ground
but
tugged
at
his
leash
and
tried
to
break
into
run
cold
see
by
the
gleam
in
holmes
eyes
that
he
thought
we
were
nearing
the
end
of
our
journey
our
course
now
ran
down
nine
elms
until
we
came
to
broderick
and
nelson
large
timber
yard
just
past
the
white
eagle
tavern
here
the
dog
frantic
with
excitement
turned
down
through
the
side
gate
into
the
enclosure
where
the
sawyers
were
already
at
work
on
the
dog
raced
through
sawdust
and
shavings
down
an
alley
round
passage
between
two
wood
piles
and
finally
with
triumphant
yelp
sprang
upon
large
barrel
which
still
stood
upon
the
hand
trolley
on
which
it
had
been
brought
with
lolling
tongue
and
blinking
eyes
toby
stood
upon
the
cask
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
for
some
sign
of
appreciation
the
staves
of
the
barrel
and
the
wheels
of
the
trolley
were
smeared
with
dark
liquid
and
the
whole
air
was
heavy
with
the
smell
of
creosote
sherlock
holmes
and
looked
blankly
at
each
other
and
then
burst
simultaneously
into
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
laughter
viii
the
baker
street
irregulars
what
now
asked
toby
has
lost
his
character
for
infallibility
he
acted
according
to
his
lights
said
holmes
lifting
him
down
from
the
barrel
and
walking
him
out
of
the
timber
yard
if
you
consider
how
much
creosote
is
carted
about
london
in
one
day
it
is
no
great
wonder
that
our
trail
should
have
been
crossed
it
is
much
used
now
especially
for
the
seasoning
of
wood
poor
toby
is
not
to
blame
we
must
get
on
the
main
scent
again
suppose
yes
and
fortunately
we
have
no
distance
to
go
evidently
what
puzzled
the
dog
at
the
corner
of
knight
place
was
that
there
were
two
different
trails
running
in
opposite
directions
we
took
the
wrong
one
it
only
remains
to
follow
the
other
there
was
no
difficulty
about
this
on
leading
toby
to
the
place
where
he
had
committed
his
fault
he
cast
about
in
wide
circle
and
finally
dashed
off
in
fresh
direction
we
must
take
care
that
he
does
not
now
bring
us
to
the
place
where
the
creosote
barrel
came
from
observed
had
thought
of
that
but
you
notice
that
he
keeps
on
the
pavement
whereas
the
barrel
passed
down
the
roadway
no
we
are
on
the
true
scent
now
it
tended
down
towards
the
river
side
running
through
belmont
place
and
prince
street
at
the
end
of
broad
street
it
ran
right
down
to
the
water
edge
where
there
was
small
wooden
wharf
toby
led
us
to
the
very
edge
of
this
and
there
stood
whining
looking
out
on
the
dark
current
beyond
we
are
out
of
luck
said
holmes
they
have
taken
to
boat
here
several
small
punts
and
skiffs
were
lying
about
in
the
water
and
on
the
edge
of
the
wharf
we
took
toby
round
to
each
in
turn
but
though
he
sniffed
earnestly
he
made
no
sign
close
to
the
rude
landing
stage
was
small
brick
house
with
wooden
placard
slung
out
through
the
second
window
mordecai
smith
was
printed
across
it
in
large
letters
and
underneath
boats
to
hire
by
the
hour
or
day
second
inscription
above
the
door
informed
us
that
steam
launch
was
kept
statement
which
was
confirmed
by
great
pile
of
coke
upon
the
jetty
sherlock
holmes
looked
slowly
round
and
his
face
assumed
an
ominous
expression
this
looks
bad
said
he
these
fellows
are
sharper
than
expected
they
seem
to
have
covered
their
tracks
there
has
fear
been
preconcerted
management
here
he
was
approaching
the
door
of
the
house
when
it
opened
and
little
curly
headed
lad
of
six
came
running
out
followed
by
stoutish
red
faced
woman
with
large
sponge
in
her
hand
you
come
back
and
be
washed

she
shouted
come
back
you
young

for
if
your

comes
home
and
finds

let
us
hear
of

chap
said
holmes
strategically
what
rosy
cheeked
young
rascal
now
jack
is
there
anything
you
would
like
the
youth
pondered
for
moment
like
shillin
said
he
nothing
you
would
like
better
like
two
shillin
better
the
prodigy
answered
after
some
thought
here
you
are
then
catch
fine
child
mrs
smith
lor
bless
you
sir
he
is
that
and
forward
he
gets
most
too
much
for
me
to
manage
specially
when
my
man
is
away
days
at
time
away
is
he
said
holmes
in
disappointed
voice
am
sorry
for
that
for
wanted
to
speak
to
mr
smith
he
been
away
since
yesterday
mornin
sir
and
truth
to
tell
am
beginnin
to
feel
frightened
about
him
but
if
it
was
about
boat
sir
maybe
could
serve
as
well
wanted
to
hire
his
steam
launch
why
bless
you
sir
it
is
in
the
steam
launch
that
he
has
gone
that
what
puzzles
me
for
know
there
ain
more
coals
in
her
than
would
take
her
to
about
woolwich
and
back
if
he
been
away
in
the
barge
ha
thought
nothin
for
many
time
job
has
taken
him
as
far
as
gravesend
and
then
if
there
was
much
doin
there
he
might
ha
stayed
over
but
what
good
is
steam
launch
without
coals
he
might
have
bought
some
at
wharf
down
the
river
he
might
sir
but
it
weren
his
way
many
time
ve
heard
him
call
out
at
the
prices
they
charge
for
few
odd
bags
besides
don
like
that
wooden
legged
man
wi
his
ugly
face
and
outlandish
talk
what
did
he
want
always
knockin
about
here
for
wooden
legged
man
said
holmes
with
bland
surprise
yes
sir
brown
monkey
faced
chap
that
called
more
once
for
my
old
man
it
was
him
that
roused
him
up
yester
night
and
what
more
my
man
knew
he
was
comin
for
he
had
steam
up
in
the
launch
tell
you
straight
sir
don
feel
easy
in
my
mind
about
it
but
my
dear
mrs
smith
said
holmes
shrugging
his
shoulders
you
are
frightening
yourself
about
nothing
how
could
you
possibly
tell
that
it
was
the
wooden
legged
man
who
came
in
the
night
don
quite
understand
how
you
can
be
so
sure
his
voice
sir
knew
his
voice
which
is
kind
thick
and
foggy
he
tapped
at
the
winder
about
three
it
would
be
show
leg
matey
says
he
time
to
turn
out
guard
my
old
man
woke
up
jim
that
my
eldest
and
away
they
went
without
so
much
as
word
to
me
could
hear
the
wooden
leg
clackin
on
the
stones
and
was
this
wooden
legged
man
alone
couldn
say
am
sure
sir
didn
hear
no
one
else
am
sorry
mrs
smith
for
wanted
steam
launch
and
have
heard
good
reports
of
the
let
me
see
what
is
her
name
the
aurora
sir
ah
she
not
that
old
green
launch
with
yellow
line
very
broad
in
the
beam
no
indeed
she
as
trim
little
thing
as
any
on
the
river
she
been
fresh
painted
black
with
two
red
streaks
thanks
hope
that
you
will
hear
soon
from
mr
smith
am
going
down
the
river
and
if
should
see
anything
of
the
aurora
shall
let
him
know
that
you
are
uneasy
black
funnel
you
say
no
sir
black
with
white
band
ah
of
course
it
was
the
sides
which
were
black
good
morning
mrs
smith
there
is
boatman
here
with
wherry
watson
we
shall
take
it
and
cross
the
river
the
main
thing
with
people
of
that
sort
said
holmes
as
we
sat
in
the
sheets
of
the
wherry
is
never
to
let
them
think
that
their
information
can
be
of
the
slightest
importance
to
you
if
you
do
they
will
instantly
shut
up
like
an
oyster
if
you
listen
to
them
under
protest
as
it
were
you
are
very
likely
to
get
what
you
want
our
course
now
seems
pretty
clear

what
would
you
do
then
would
engage
launch
and
go
down
the
river
on
the
track
of
the
aurora
my
dear
fellow
it
would
be
colossal
task
she
may
have
touched
at
any
wharf
on
either
side
of
the
stream
between
here
and
greenwich
below
the
bridge
there
is
perfect
labyrinth
of
landing
places
for
miles
it
would
take
you
days
and
days
to
exhaust
them
if
you
set
about
it
alone
employ
the
police
then
no
shall
probably
call
athelney
jones
in
at
the
last
moment
he
is
not
bad
fellow
and
should
not
like
to
do
anything
which
would
injure
him
professionally
but
have
fancy
for
working
it
out
myself
now
that
we
have
gone
so
far
could
we
advertise
then
asking
for
information
from
wharfingers
worse
and
worse
our
men
would
know
that
the
chase
was
hot
at
their
heels
and
they
would
be
off
out
of
the
country
as
it
is
they
are
likely
enough
to
leave
but
as
long
as
they
think
they
are
perfectly
safe
they
will
be
in
no
hurry
jones
energy
will
be
of
use
to
us
there
for
his
view
of
the
case
is
sure
to
push
itself
into
the
daily
press
and
the
runaways
will
think
that
every
one
is
off
on
the
wrong
scent
what
are
we
to
do
then
asked
as
we
landed
near
millbank
penitentiary
take
this
hansom
drive
home
have
some
breakfast
and
get
an
hour
sleep
it
is
quite
on
the
cards
that
we
may
be
afoot
tonight
again
stop
at
telegraph
office
cabby
we
will
keep
toby
for
he
may
be
of
use
to
us
yet
we
pulled
up
at
the
great
peter
street
post
office
and
holmes
despatched
his
wire
whom
do
you
think
that
is
to
he
asked
as
we
resumed
our
journey
am
sure
don
know
you
remember
the
baker
street
division
of
the
detective
police
force
whom
employed
in
the
jefferson
hope
case
well
said
laughing
this
is
just
the
case
where
they
might
be
invaluable
if
they
fail
have
other
resources
but
shall
try
them
first
that
wire
was
to
my
dirty
little
lieutenant
wiggins
and
expect
that
he
and
his
gang
will
be
with
us
before
we
have
finished
our
breakfast
it
was
between
eight
and
nine
clock
now
and
was
conscious
of
strong
reaction
after
the
successive
excitements
of
the
night
was
limp
and
weary
befogged
in
mind
and
fatigued
in
body
had
not
the
professional
enthusiasm
which
carried
my
companion
on
nor
could
look
at
the
matter
as
mere
abstract
intellectual
problem
as
far
as
the
death
of
bartholomew
sholto
went
had
heard
little
good
of
him
and
could
feel
no
intense
antipathy
to
his
murderers
the
treasure
however
was
different
matter
that
or
part
of
it
belonged
rightfully
to
miss
morstan
while
there
was
chance
of
recovering
it
was
ready
to
devote
my
life
to
the
one
object
true
if
found
it
would
probably
put
her
forever
beyond
my
reach
yet
it
would
be
petty
and
selfish
love
which
would
be
influenced
by
such
thought
as
that
if
holmes
could
work
to
find
the
criminals
had
tenfold
stronger
reason
to
urge
me
on
to
find
the
treasure
bath
at
baker
street
and
complete
change
freshened
me
up
wonderfully
when
came
down
to
our
room
found
the
breakfast
laid
and
homes
pouring
out
the
coffee
here
it
is
said
he
laughing
and
pointing
to
an
open
newspaper
the
energetic
jones
and
the
ubiquitous
reporter
have
fixed
it
up
between
them
but
you
have
had
enough
of
the
case
better
have
your
ham
and
eggs
first
took
the
paper
from
him
and
read
the
short
notice
which
was
headed
mysterious
business
at
upper
norwood
about
twelve
clock
last
night
said
the
standard
mr
bartholomew
sholto
of
pondicherry
lodge
upper
norwood
was
found
dead
in
his
room
under
circumstances
which
point
to
foul
play
as
far
as
we
can
learn
no
actual
traces
of
violence
were
found
upon
mr
sholto
person
but
valuable
collection
of
indian
gems
which
the
deceased
gentleman
had
inherited
from
his
father
has
been
carried
off
the
discovery
was
first
made
by
mr
sherlock
holmes
and
dr
watson
who
had
called
at
the
house
with
mr
thaddeus
sholto
brother
of
the
deceased
by
singular
piece
of
good
fortune
mr
athelney
jones
the
well
known
member
of
the
detective
police
force
happened
to
be
at
the
norwood
police
station
and
was
on
the
ground
within
half
an
hour
of
the
first
alarm
his
trained
and
experienced
faculties
were
at
once
directed
towards
the
detection
of
the
criminals
with
the
gratifying
result
that
the
brother
thaddeus
sholto
has
already
been
arrested
together
with
the
housekeeper
mrs
bernstone
an
indian
butler
named
lal
rao
and
porter
or
gatekeeper
named
mcMurdo
it
is
quite
certain
that
the
thief
or
thieves
were
well
acquainted
with
the
house
for
mr
jones
well
known
technical
knowledge
and
his
powers
of
minute
observation
have
enabled
him
to
prove
conclusively
that
the
miscreants
could
not
have
entered
by
the
door
or
by
the
window
but
must
have
made
their
way
across
the
roof
of
the
building
and
so
through
trap
door
into
room
which
communicated
with
that
in
which
the
body
was
found
this
fact
which
has
been
very
clearly
made
out
proves
conclusively
that
it
was
no
mere
haphazard
burglary
the
prompt
and
energetic
action
of
the
officers
of
the
law
shows
the
great
advantage
of
the
presence
on
such
occasions
of
single
vigorous
and
masterful
mind
we
cannot
but
think
that
it
supplies
an
argument
to
those
who
would
wish
to
see
our
detectives
more
de
centralized
and
so
brought
into
closer
and
more
effective
touch
with
the
cases
which
it
is
their
duty
to
investigate
isn
it
gorgeous
said
holmes
grinning
over
his
coffee
cup
what
do
you
think
of
it
think
that
we
have
had
close
shave
ourselves
of
being
arrested
for
the
crime
so
do
wouldn
answer
for
our
safety
now
if
he
should
happen
to
have
another
of
his
attacks
of
energy
at
this
moment
there
was
loud
ring
at
the
bell
and
could
hear
mrs
hudson
our
landlady
raising
her
voice
in
wail
of
expostulation
and
dismay
by
heavens
holmes
said
half
rising
believe
that
they
are
really
after
us
no
it
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
it
is
the
unofficial
force
the
baker
street
irregulars
as
he
spoke
there
came
swift
pattering
of
naked
feet
upon
the
stairs
clatter
of
high
voices
and
in
rushed
dozen
dirty
and
ragged
little
street
arabs
there
was
some
show
of
discipline
among
them
despite
their
tumultuous
entry
for
they
instantly
drew
up
in
line
and
stood
facing
us
with
expectant
faces
one
of
their
number
taller
and
older
than
the
others
stood
forward
with
an
air
of
lounging
superiority
which
was
very
funny
in
such
disreputable
little
scarecrow
got
your
message
sir
said
he
and
brought
em
on
sharp
three
bob
and
tanner
for
tickets
here
you
are
said
holmes
producing
some
silver
in
future
they
can
report
to
you
wiggins
and
you
to
me
cannot
have
the
house
invaded
in
this
way
however
it
is
just
as
well
that
you
should
all
hear
the
instructions
want
to
find
the
whereabouts
of
steam
launch
called
the
aurora
owner
mordecai
smith
black
with
two
red
streaks
funnel
black
with
white
band
she
is
down
the
river
somewhere
want
one
boy
to
be
at
mordecai
smith
landing
stage
opposite
millbank
to
say
if
the
boat
comes
back
you
must
divide
it
out
among
yourselves
and
do
both
banks
thoroughly
let
me
know
the
moment
yo
have
news
is
that
all
clear
yes
guv
nor
said
wiggins
the
old
scale
of
pay
and
guinea
to
the
boy
who
finds
the
boat
here
day
in
advance
now
off
you
go
he
handed
them
shilling
each
and
away
they
buzzed
down
the
stairs
and
saw
them
moment
later
streaming
down
the
street
if
the
launch
is
above
water
they
will
find
her
said
holmes
as
he
rose
from
the
table
and
lit
his
pipe
they
can
go
everywhere
see
everything
overhear
every
one
expect
to
hear
before
evening
that
they
have
spotted
her
in
the
mean
while
we
can
do
nothing
but
await
results
we
cannot
pick
up
the
broken
trail
until
we
find
either
the
aurora
or
mr
mordecai
smith
toby
could
eat
these
scraps
dare
say
are
you
going
to
bed
holmes
no
am
not
tired
have
curious
constitution
never
remember
feeling
tired
by
work
though
idleness
exhausts
me
completely
am
going
to
smoke
and
to
think
over
this
queer
business
to
which
my
fair
client
has
introduced
us
if
ever
man
had
an
easy
task
this
of
ours
ought
to
be
wooden
legged
men
are
not
so
common
but
the
other
man
must
should
think
be
absolutely
unique
that
other
man
again
have
no
wish
to
make
mystery
of
him
to
you
anyway
but
you
must
have
formed
your
own
opinion
now
do
consider
the
data
diminutive
footmarks
toes
never
fettered
by
boots
naked
feet
stone
headed
wooden
mace
great
agility
small
poisoned
darts
what
do
you
make
of
all
this
savage
exclaimed
perhaps
one
of
those
indians
who
were
the
associates
of
jonathan
small
hardly
that
said
he
when
first
saw
signs
of
strange
weapons
was
inclined
to
think
so
but
the
remarkable
character
of
the
footmarks
caused
me
to
reconsider
my
views
some
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
indian
peninsula
are
small
men
but
none
could
have
left
such
marks
as
that
the
hindoo
proper
has
long
and
thin
feet
the
sandal
wearing
mohammedan
has
the
great
toe
well
separated
from
the
others
because
the
thong
is
commonly
passed
between
these
little
darts
too
could
only
be
shot
in
one
way
they
are
from
blow
pipe
now
then
where
are
we
to
find

that
all

that

it

no

now
all
about

his
own
no
doubt
for
he
had
remarkable
gift
for
improvisation
have
vague
remembrance
of
his
gaunt
limbs
his
earnest
face
and
the
rise
and
fall
of
his
bow
then
seemed
to
be
floated
peacefully
away
upon
soft
sea
of
sound
until
found
myself
in
dreamland
with
the
sweet
face
of
mary
morstan
looking
down
upon
me
ix
break
in
the
chain
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
before
woke
strengthened
and
refreshed
sherlock
holmes
still
sat
exactly
as
had
left
him
save
that
he
had
laid
aside
his
violin
and
was
deep
in
book
he
looked
across
at
me
as
stirred
and
noticed
that
his
face
was
dark
and
troubled
you
have
slept
soundly
he
said
feared
that
our
talk
would
wake
you
heard
nothing
answered
have
you
had
fresh
news
then
unfortunately
no
confess
that
am
surprised
and
disappointed
expected
something
definite
by
this
time
wiggins
has
just
been
up
to
report
he
says
that
no
trace
can
be
found
of
the
launch
it
is
provoking
check
for
every
hour
is
of
importance
can
do
anything
am
perfectly
fresh
now
and
quite
ready
for
another
night
outing
no
we
can
do
nothing
we
can
only
wait
if
we
go
ourselves
the
message
might
come
in
our
absence
and
delay
be
caused
you
can
do
what
you
will
but
must
remain
on
guard
then
shall
run
over
to
camberwell
and
call
upon
mrs
cecil
forrester
she
asked
me
to
yesterday
on
mrs
cecil
forrester
asked
holmes
with
the
twinkle
of
smile
in
his
eyes
well
of
course
on
miss
morstan
too
they
were
anxious
to
hear
what
happened
would
not
tell
them
too
much
said
holmes
women
are
never
to
be
entirely
trusted
not
the
best
of
them
did
not
pause
to
argue
over
this
atrocious
sentiment
shall
be
back
in
an
hour
or
two
remarked
all
right
good
luck
but
say
if
you
are
crossing
the
river
you
may
as
well
return
toby
for
don
think
it
is
at
all
likely
that
we
shall
have
any
use
for
him
now
took
our
mongrel
accordingly
and
left
him
together
with
half
sovereign
at
the
old
naturalist
in
pinchin
lane
at
camberwell
found
miss
morstan
little
weary
after
her
night
adventures
but
very
eager
to
hear
the
news
mrs
forrester
too
was
full
of
curiosity
told
them
all
that
we
had
done
suppressing
however
the
more
dreadful
parts
of
the
tragedy
thus
although
spoke
of
mr
sholto
death
said
nothing
of
the
exact
manner
and
method
of
it
with
all
my
omissions
however
there
was
enough
to
startle
and
amaze
them
it
is
romance
cried
mrs
forrester
an
injured
lady
half
million
in
treasure
black
cannibal
and
wooden
legged
ruffian
they
take
the
place
of
the
conventional
dragon
or
wicked
earl
and
two
knight
errants
to
the
rescue
added
miss
morstan
with
bright
glance
at
me
why
mary
your
fortune
depends
upon
the
issue
of
this
search
don
think
that
you
are
nearly
excited
enough
just
imagine
what
it
must
be
to
be
so
rich
and
to
have
the
world
at
your
feet
it
sent
little
thrill
of
joy
to
my
heart
to
notice
that
she
showed
no
sign
of
elation
at
the
prospect
on
the
contrary
she
gave
toss
of
her
proud
head
as
though
the
matter
were
one
in
which
she
took
small
interest
it
is
for
mr
thaddeus
sholto
that
am
anxious
she
said
nothing
else
is
of
any
consequence
but
think
that
he
has
behaved
most
kindly
and
honourably
throughout
it
is
our
duty
to
clear
him
of
this
dreadful
and
unfounded
charge
it
was
evening
before
left
camberwell
and
quite
dark
by
the
time
reached
home
my
companion
book
and
pipe
lay
by
his
chair
but
he
had
disappeared
looked
about
in
the
hope
of
seeing
note
but
there
was
none
suppose
that
mr
sherlock
holmes
has
gone
out
said
to
mrs
hudson
as
she
came
up
to
lower
the
blinds
no
sir
he
has
gone
to
his
room
sir
do
you
know
sir
sinking
her
voice
into
an
impressive
whisper
am
afraid
for
his
health
why
so
mrs
hudson
well
he
that
strange
sir
after
you
was
gone
he
walked
and
he
walked
up
and
down
and
up
and
down
until
was
weary
of
the
sound
of
his
footstep
then
heard
him
talking
to
himself
and
muttering
and
every
time
the
bell
rang
out
he
came
on
the
stair
head
with
what
is
that
mrs
hudson
and
now
he
has
slammed
off
to
his
room
but
can
hear
him
walking
away
the
same
as
ever
hope
he
not
going
to
be
ill
sir
ventured
to
say
something
to
him
about
cooling
medicine
but
he
turned
on
me
sir
with
such
look
that
don
know
how
ever
got
out
of
the
room
don
think
that
you
have
any
cause
to
be
uneasy
mrs
hudson
answered
have
seen
him
like
this
before
he
has
some
small
matter
upon
his
mind
which
makes
him
restless
tried
to
speak
lightly
to
our
worthy
landlady
but
was
myself
somewhat
uneasy
when
through
the
long
night
still
from
time
to
time
heard
the
dull
sound
of
his
tread
and
knew
how
his
keen
spirit
was
chafing
against
this
involuntary
inaction
at
breakfast
time
he
looked
worn
and
haggard
with
little
fleck
of
feverish
colour
upon
either
cheek
you
are
knocking
yourself
up
old
man
remarked
heard
you
marching
about
in
the
night
no
could
not
sleep
he
answered
this
infernal
problem
is
consuming
me
it
is
too
much
to
be
balked
by
so
petty
an
obstacle
when
all
else
had
been
overcome
know
the
men
the
launch
everything
and
yet
can
get
no
news
have
set
other
agencies
at
work
and
used
every
means
at
my
disposal
the
whole
river
has
been
searched
on
either
side
but
there
is
no
news
nor
has
mrs
smith
heard
of
her
husband
shall
come
to
the
conclusion
soon
that
they
have
scuttled
the
craft
but
there
are
objections
to
that
or
that
mrs
smith
has
put
us
on
wrong
scent
no
think
that
may
be
dismissed
had
inquiries
made
and
there
is
launch
of
that
description
could
it
have
gone
up
the
river
have
considered
that
possibility
too
and
there
is
search
party
who
will
work
up
as
far
as
richmond
if
no
news
comes
to
day
shall
start
off
myself
to
morrow
and
go
for
the
men
rather
than
the
boat
but
surely
we
shall
hear
something
we
did
not
however
not
word
came
to
us
either
from
wiggins
or
from
the
other
agencies
there
were
articles
in
most
of
the
papers
upon
the
norwood
tragedy
they
all
appeared
to
be
rather
hostile
to
the
unfortunate
thaddeus
sholto
no
fresh
details
were
to
be
found
however
in
any
of
them
save
that
an
inquest
was
to
be
held
upon
the
following
day
walked
over
to
camberwell
in
the
evening
to
report
our
ill
success
to
the
ladies
and
on
my
return
found
holmes
dejected
and
somewhat
morose
he
would
hardly
reply
to
my
questions
and
busied
himself
all
evening
in
an
abstruse
chemical
analysis
which
involved
much
heating
of
retorts
and
distilling
of
vapours
ending
at
last
in
smell
which
fairly
drove
me
out
of
the
apartment
up
to
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
could
hear
the
clinking
of
his
test
tubes
which
told
me
that
he
was
still
engaged
in
his
malodorous
experiment

in
the
early
dawn
woke
with
start
and
was
surprised
to
find
him
standing
by
my
bedside
clad
in
rude
sailor
dress
with
pea
jacket
and
coarse
red
scarf
round
his
neck
am
off
down
the
river
watson
said
he
have
been
turning
it
over
in
my
mind
and
can
see
only
one
way
out
of
it
is
worth
trying
at
all
events
surely
can
come
with
you
then
said
no
you
can
be
much
more
useful
if
you
will
remain
here
as
my
representative
am
loath
to
go
for
it
is
quite
on
the
cards
that
some
message
may
come
during
the
day
though
wiggins
was
despondent
about
it
last
night
want
you
to
open
all
notes
and
telegrams
and
to
act
on
your
own
judgment
if
any
news
should
come
can
rely
upon
you
most
certainly
am
afraid
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
wire
to
me
for
can
hardly
tell
yet
where
may
find
myself
if
am
in
luck
however
may
not
be
gone
so
very
long
shall
have
news
of
some
sort
or
other
before
get
back
had
heard
nothing
of
him
by
breakfast
time
on
opening
the
standard
however
found
that
there
was
fresh
allusion
to
the
business
with
reference
to
the
upper
norwood
tragedy
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
matter
promises
to
be
even
more
complex
and
mysterious
than
was
originally
supposed
fresh
evidence
has
shown
that
it
is
quite
impossible
that
mr
thaddeus
sholto
could
have
been
in
any
way
concerned
in
the
matter
he
and
the
housekeeper
mrs
bernstone
were
both
released
yesterday
evening
it
is
believed
however
that
the
police
have
clue
as
to
the
real
culprits
and
that
it
is
being
prosecuted
by
mr
athelney
jones
of
scotland
yard
with
all
his
well
known
energy
and
sagacity
further
arrests
may
be
expected
at
any
moment
that
is
satisfactory
so
far
as
it
goes
thought
friend
sholto
is
safe
at
any
rate
wonder
what
the
fresh
clue
may
be
though
it
seems
to
be
stereotyped
form
whenever
the
police
have
made
blunder
tossed
the
paper
down
upon
the
table
but
at
that
moment
my
eye
caught
an
advertisement
in
the
agony
column
it
ran
in
this
way
lost
whereas
mordecai
smith
boatman
and
his
son
jim
left
smith
wharf
at
or
about
three
clock
last
tuesday
morning
in
the
steam
launch
aurora
black
with
two
red
stripes
funnel
black
with
white
band
the
sum
of
five
pounds
will
be
paid
to
any
one
who
can
give
information
to
mrs
smith
at
smith
wharf
or
at
221b
baker
street
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
said
mordecai
smith
and
the
launch
aurora
this
was
clearly
holmes
doing
the
baker
street
address
was
enough
to
prove
that
it
struck
me
as
rather
ingenious
because
it
might
be
read
by
the
fugitives
without
their
seeing
in
it
more
than
the
natural
anxiety
of
wife
for
her
missing
husband
it
was
long
day
every
time
that
knock
came
to
the
door
or
sharp
step
passed
in
the
street
imagined
that
it
was
either
holmes
returning
or
an
answer
to
his
advertisement
tried
to
read
but
my
thoughts
would
wander
off
to
our
strange
quest
and
to
the
ill
assorted
and
villainous
pair
whom
we
were
pursuing
could
there
be
wondered
some
radical
flaw
in
my
companion
reasoning
might
he
be
suffering
from
some
huge
self
deception
was
it
not
possible
that
his
nimble
and
speculative
mind
had
built
up
this
wild
theory
upon
faulty
premises
had
never
known
him
to
be
wrong
and
yet
the
keenest
reasoner
may
occasionally
be
deceived
he
was
likely
thought
to
fall
into
error
through
the
over
refinement
of
his
logic
his
preference
for
subtle
and
bizarre
explanation
when
plainer
and
more
commonplace
one
lay
ready
to
his
hand
yet
on
the
other
hand
had
myself
seen
the
evidence
and
had
heard
the
reasons
for
his
deductions
when
looked
back
on
the
long
chain
of
curious
circumstances
many
of
them
trivial
in
themselves
but
all
tending
in
the
same
direction
could
not
disguise
from
myself
that
even
if
holmes
explanation
were
incorrect
the
true
theory
must
be
equally
outré
and
startling
at
three
clock
in
the
afternoon
there
was
loud
peal
at
the
bell
an
authoritative
voice
in
the
hall
and
to
my
surprise
no
less
person
than
mr
athelney
jones
was
shown
up
to
me
very
different
was
he
however
from
the
brusque
and
masterful
professor
of
common
sense
who
had
taken
over
the
case
so
confidently
at
upper
norwood
his
expression
was
downcast
and
his
bearing
meek
and
even
apologetic
good
day
sir
good
day
said
he
mr
sherlock
holmes
is
out
understand
yes
and
cannot
be
sure
when
he
will
be
back
but
perhaps
you
would
care
to
wait
take
that
chair
and
try
one
of
these
cigars
thank
you
don
mind
if
do
said
he
mopping
his
face
with
red
bandanna
handkerchief
and
whisky
and
soda
well
half
glass
it
is
very
hot
for
the
time
of
year
and
have
had
good
deal
to
worry
and
try
me
you
know
my
theory
about
this
norwood
case
remember
that
you
expressed
one
well
have
been
obliged
to
reconsider
it
had
my
net
drawn
tightly
round
mr
sholto
sir
when
pop
he
went
through
hole
in
the
middle
of
it
he
was
able
to
prove
an
alibi
which
could
not
be
shaken
from
the
time
that
he
left
his
brother
room
he
was
never
out
of
sight
of
someone
or
other
so
it
could
not
be
he
who
climbed
over
roofs
and
through
trapdoors
it
very
dark
case
and
my
professional
credit
is
at
stake
should
be
very
glad
of
little
assistance
we
all
need
help
sometimes
said
your
friend
mr
sherlock
holmes
is
wonderful
man
sir
said
he
in
husky
and
confidential
voice
he
man
who
is
not
to
be
beat
have
known
that
young
man
go
into
good
many
cases
but
never
saw
the
case
yet
that
he
could
not
throw
light
upon
he
is
irregular
in
his
methods
and
little
quick
perhaps
in
jumping
at
theories
but
on
the
whole
think
he
would
have
made
most
promising
officer
and
don
care
who
knows
it
have
had
wire
from
him
this
morning
by
which
understand
that
he
has
got
some
clue
to
this
sholto
business
here
is
the
message
he
took
the
telegram
out
of
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
me
it
was
dated
from
poplar
at
twelve
clock
go
to
baker
street
at
once
if
have
not
returned
wait
for
me
am
close
on
the
track
of
the
sholto
gang
you
can
come
with
us
to
night
if
you
want
to
be
in
at
the
finish
this
sounds
well
he
has
evidently
picked
up
the
scent
again
said
ah
then
he
has
been
at
fault
too
exclaimed
jones
with
evident
satisfaction
even
the
best
of
us
are
thrown
off
sometimes
of
course
this
may
prove
to
be
false
alarm
but
it
is
my
duty
as
an
officer
of
the
law
to
allow
no
chance
to
slip
but
there
is
some
one
at
the
door
perhaps
this
is
he
heavy
step
was
heard
ascending
the
stair
with
great
wheezing
and
rattling
as
from
man
who
was
sorely
put
to
it
for
breath
once
or
twice
he
stopped
as
though
the
climb
were
too
much
for
him
but
at
last
he
made
his
way
to
our
door
and
entered
his
appearance
corresponded
to
the
sounds
which
we
had
heard
he
was
an
aged
man
clad
in
seafaring
garb
with
an
old
pea
jacket
buttoned
up
to
his
throat
his
back
was
bowed
his
knees
were
shaky
and
his
breathing
was
painfully
asthmatic
as
he
leaned
upon
thick
oaken
cudgel
his
shoulders
heaved
in
the
effort
to
draw
the
air
into
his
lungs
he
had
coloured
scarf
round
his
chin
and
could
see
little
of
his
face
save
pair
of
keen
dark
eyes
overhung
by
bushy
white
brows
and
long
grey
side
whiskers
altogether
he
gave
me
the
impression
of
respectable
master
mariner
who
had
fallen
into
years
and
poverty
what
is
it
my
man
asked
he
looked
about
him
in
the
slow
methodical
fashion
of
old
age
is
mr
sherlock
holmes
here
said
he
no
but
am
acting
for
him
you
can
tell
me
any
message
you
have
for
him
it
was
to
him
himself
was
to
tell
it
said
he
but
tell
you
that
am
acting
for
him
was
it
about
mordecai
smith
boat
yes
knows
well
where
it
is
an
knows
where
the
men
he
is
after
are
an
knows
where
the
treasure
is
knows
all
about
it
then
tell
me
and
shall
let
him
know
it
was
to
him
was
to
tell
it
he
repeated
with
the
petulant
obstinacy
of
very
old
man
well
you
must
wait
for
him
no
ain
goin
to
lose
whole
day
to
please
no
one
if
mr
holmes

then
mr
holmes
must
find
it
all
out
for
himself
don
care
about
the
look
of
either
of
you
and
won
tell
word
he
shuffled
towards
the
door
but
athelney
jones
got
in
front
of
him
wait
bit
my
friend
said
he
you
have
important
information
and
you
must
not
walk
off
we
shall
keep
you
whether
you
like
or
not
until
our
friend
returns
the
old
man
made
little
run
towards
the
door
but
as
athelney
jones
put
his
broad
back
up
against
it
he
recognized
the
uselessness
of
resistance
pretty
sort
treatment
this
he
cried
stamping
his
stick
come
here
to
see
gentleman
and

two
who

life

and

you
will
be
none
the
worse
said
we
shall
recompense
you
for
the
loss
of
your
time
sit
over
here
on
the
sofa
and
you
will
not
have
long
to
wait
he
came
across
sullenly
enough
and
seated
himself
with
his
face
resting
on
his
hands
jones
and
resumed
our
cigars
and
our
talk
suddenly
however
holmes
voice
broke
in
upon
us
think
that
you
might
offer
me
cigar
too
he
said
we
both
started
in
our
chairs
there
was
holmes
sitting
close
to
us
with
an
air
of
quiet
amusement
holmes
exclaimed
you
here
but
where
is
the
old
man
here
is
the
old
man
said
he
holding
out
heap
of
white
hair
here
he
is
wig
whiskers
eyebrows
and
all
thought
my
disguise
was
pretty
good
but
hardly
expected
that
it
would
stand
that
test
ah
you
rogue
cried
jones
highly
delighted
you
would
have
made
an
actor
and
rare
one
you
had
the
proper
workhouse
cough
and
those
weak
legs
of
yours
are
worth
ten
pound
week
thought
knew
the
glint
of
your
eye
though
you
didn
get
away
from
us
so
easily
you
see
have
been
working
in
that
get
up
all
day
said
he
lighting
his
cigar
you
see
good
many
of
the
criminal
classes
begin
to
know
me
especially
since
our
friend
here
took
to
publishing
some
of
my
cases
so
can
only
go
on
the
war
path
under
some
simple
disguise
like
this
you
got
my
wire
yes
that
was
what
brought
me
here
how
has
your
case
prospered
it
has
all
come
to
nothing
have
had
to
release
two
of
my
prisoners
and
there
is
no
evidence
against
the
other
two
never
mind
we
shall
give
you
two
others
in
the
place
of
them
but
you
must
put
yourself
under
my
orders
you
are
welcome
to
all
the
official
credit
but
you
must
act
on
the
line
that
point
out
is
that
agreed
entirely
if
you
will
help
me
to
the
men
well
then
in
the
first
place
shall
want
fast
police
boat—
steam
launch
to
be
at
the
westminster
stairs
at
seven
clock
that
is
easily
managed
there
is
always
one
about
there
but
can
step
across
the
road
and
telephone
to
make
sure
then
shall
want
two
stanch
men
in
case
of
resistance
there
will
be
two
or
three
in
the
boat
what
else
when
we
secure
the
men
we
shall
get
the
treasure
think
that
it
would
be
pleasure
to
my
friend
here
to
take
the
box
round
to
the
young
lady
to
whom
half
of
it
rightfully
belongs
let
her
be
the
first
to
open
it
eh
watson
it
would
be
great
pleasure
to
me
rather
an
irregular
proceeding
said
jones
shaking
his
head
however
the
whole
thing
is
irregular
and
suppose
we
must
wink
at
it
the
treasure
must
afterwards
be
handed
over
to
the
authorities
until
after
the
official
investigation
certainly
that
is
easily
managed
one
other
point
should
much
like
to
have
few
details
about
this
matter
from
the
lips
of
jonathan
small
himself
you
know
like
to
work
the
detail
of
my
cases
out
there
is
no
objection
to
my
having
an
unofficial
interview
with
him
either
here
in
my
rooms
or
elsewhere
as
long
as
he
is
efficiently
guarded
well
you
are
master
of
the
situation
have
had
no
proof
yet
of
the
existence
of
this
jonathan
small
however
if
you
can
catch
him
don
see
how
can
refuse
you
an
interview
with
him
that
is
understood
then
perfectly
is
there
anything
else
only
that
insist
upon
your
dining
with
us
it
will
be
ready
in
half
an
hour
have
oysters
and
brace
of
grouse
with
something
little
choice
in
white
wines
watson
you
have
never
yet
recognized
my
merits
as
housekeeper
the
end
of
the
islander
our
meal
was
merry
one
holmes
coud
talk
exceedingly
well
when
he
chose
and
that
night
he
did
choose
he
appeared
to
be
in
state
of
nervous
exaltation
have
never
known
him
so
brilliant
he
spoke
on
quick
succession
of
subjects
on
miracle
plays
on
mediaeval
pottery
on
stradivarius
violins
on
the
buddhism
of
ceylon
and
on
the
warships
of
the
future—
handling
each
as
though
he
had
made
special
study
of
it
his
bright
humour
marked
the
reaction
from
his
black
depression
of
the
preceding
days
athelney
jones
proved
to
be
sociable
soul
in
his
hours
of
relaxation
and
face
his
dinner
with
the
air
of
bon
vivant
for
myself
felt
elated
at
the
thought
that
we
were
nearing
the
end
of
our
task
and
caught
something
of
holmes
gaiety
none
of
us
alluded
during
dinner
to
the
cause
which
had
brought
us
together
when
the
cloth
was
cleared
holmes
glanced
at
this
watch
and
filled
up
three
glasses
with
port
one
bumper
said
he
to
the
success
of
our
little
expedition
and
now
it
is
high
time
we
were
off
have
you
pistol
watson
have
my
old
service
revolver
in
my
desk
you
had
best
take
it
then
it
is
well
to
be
prepared
see
that
the
cab
is
at
the
door
ordered
it
for
half
past
six
it
was
little
past
seven
before
we
reached
the
westminster
wharf
and
found
our
launch
awaiting
us
holmes
eyed
it
critically
is
there
anything
to
mark
it
as
police
boat
yes
that
green
lamp
at
the
side
then
take
it
off
the
small
change
was
made
we
stepped
on
board
and
the
ropes
were
cast
off
jones
holmes
and
sat
in
the
stern
there
was
one
man
at
the
rudder
one
to
tend
the
engines
and
two
burly
police
inspectors
forward
where
to
asked
jones
to
the
tower
tell
them
to
stop
opposite
to
jacobson
yard
our
craft
was
evidently
very
fast
one
we
shot
past
the
long
lines
of
loaded
barges
as
though
they
were
stationary
holmes
smiled
with
satisfaction
as
we
overhauled
river
steamer
and
left
her
behind
us
we
ought
to
be
able
to
catch
anything
on
the
river
he
said
well
hardly
that
but
there
are
not
many
launches
to
beat
us
we
shall
have
to
catch
the
aurora
and
she
has
name
for
being
clipper
will
tell
you
how
the
land
lies
watson
you
recollect
how
annoyed
was
at
being
balked
by
so
small
thing
yes
well
gave
my
mind
thorough
rest
by
plunging
into
chemical
analysis
one
of
our
greatest
statesmen
has
said
that
change
of
work
is
the
best
rest
so
it
is
when
had
succeeded
in
dissolving
the
hydrocarbon
which
was
at
work
at
came
back
to
our
problem
of
the
sholtos
and
thought
the
whole
matter
out
again
my
boys
had
been
up
the
river
and
down
the
river
without
result
the
launch
was
not
at
any
landing
stage
or
wharf
nor
had
it
returned
yet
it
could
hardly
have
been
scuttled
to
hide
their
traces
though
that
always
remained
as
possible
hypothesis
if
all
else
failed
knew
this
man
small
had
certain
degree
of
low
cunning
but
did
not
think
him
capable
of
anything
in
the
nature
of
delicate
finesse
that
is
usually
product
of
higher
education
then
reflected
that
since
he
had
certainly
been
in
london
some
time
as
we
had
evidence
that
he
maintained
continual
watch
over
pondicherry
lodge
he
could
hardly
leave
at
moment
notice
but
would
need
some
little
time
if
it
were
only
day
to
arrange
his
affairs
that
was
the
balance
of
probability
at
any
rate
it
seems
to
me
to
be
little
weak
said
it
is
more
probable
that
he
had
arranged
his
affairs
before
ever
he
set
out
upon
his
expedition
no
hardly
think
so
this
lair
of
his
would
be
too
valuable
retreat
in
case
of
need
for
him
to
give
it
up
until
he
was
sure
that
he
could
do
without
it
but
second
consideration
struck
me
jonathan
small
must
have
felt
that
the
peculiar
appearance
of
his
companion
however
much
he
may
have
top
coated
him
would
give
rise
to
gossip
and
possibly
be
associated
with
this
norwood
tragedy
he
was
quite
sharp
enough
to
see
that
they
had
started
from
their
head
quarters
under
cover
of
darkness
and
he
would
wish
to
get
back
before
it
was
broad
light
now
it
was
past
three
clock
according
to
mrs
smith
when
they
got
the
boat
it
would
be
quite
bright
and
people
would
be
about
in
an
hour
or
so
therefore
argued
they
did
not
go
very
far
they
paid
smith
well
to
hold
his
tongue
reserved
his
launch
for
the
final
escape
and
hurried
to
their
lodgings
with
the
treasure
box
in
couple
of
nights
when
they
had
time
to
see
what
view
the
papers
took
and
whether
there
was
any
suspicion
they
would
make
their
way
under
cover
of
darkness
to
some
ship
at
gravesend
or
in
the
downs
where
no
doubt
they
had
already
arranged
for
passages
to
america
or
the
colonies
but
the
launch
they
could
not
have
taken
that
to
their
lodgings
quite
so
argued
that
the
launch
must
be
no
great
way
off
in
spite
of
its
invisibility
then
put
myself
in
the
place
of
small
and
looked
at
it
as
man
of
his
capacity
would
he
would
probably
consider
that
to
send
back
the
launch
or
to
keep
it
at
wharf
would
make
pursuit
easy
if
the
police
did
happen
to
get
on
his
track
how
then
could
he
conceal
the
launch
and
yet
have
her
at
hand
when
wanted
wondered
what
should
do
myself
if
were
in
his
shoes
could
only
think
of
one
way
of
doing
it
might
land
the
launch
over
to
some
boat
builder
or
repairer
with
directions
to
make
trifling
change
in
her
she
would
then
be
removed
to
his
shed
or
yard
and
so
be
effectually
concealed
while
at
the
same
time
could
have
her
at
few
hours
notice

that
seems
simple
enough
it
is
just
these
very
simple
things
which
are
extremely
liable
to
be
overlooked
however
determined
to
act
on
the
idea
started
at
once
in
this
harmless
seaman
rig
and
inquired
at
all
the
yards
down
the
river
drew
blank
at
fifteen
but
at
the
sixteenth
jacobson
learned
that
the
aurora
had
been
handed
over
to
them
two
days
ago
by
wooden
legged
man
with
some
trivial
directions
as
to
her
rudder
there
ain
naught
amiss
with
her
rudder
said
the
foreman
there
she
lies
with
the
red
streaks
at
that
moment
who
should
come
down
but
mordecai
smith
the
missing
owner
he
was
rather
the
worse
for
liquor
should
not
of
course
have
known
him
but
he
bellowed
out
his
name
and
the
name
of
his
launch
want
her
to
night
at
eight
clock
said
he—
eight
clock
sharp
mind
for
have
two
gentlemen
who
won
be
kept
waiting
they
had
evidently
paid
him
well
for
he
was
very
flush
of
money
chucking
shillings
about
to
the
men
followed
him
some
distance
but
he
subsided
into
an
alehouse
so
went
back
to
the
yard
and
happening
to
pick
up
one
of
my
boys
on
the
way
stationed
him
as
sentry
over
the
launch
he
is
to
stand
at
the
water
edge
and
wave
his
handkerchief
to
us
when
they
start
we
shall
be
lying
off
in
the
stream
and
it
will
be
strange
thing
if
we
do
not
take
men
treasure
and
all
you
have
planned
it
all
very
neatly
whether
they
are
the
right
men
or
not
said
jones
but
if
the
affair
were
in
my
hands
should
have
had
body
of
police
in
jacobson
yard
and
arrested
them
when
they
came
down
which
would
have
been
never
this
man
small
is
pretty
shrewd
fellow
he
would
send
scout
on
ahead
and
if
anything
made
him
suspicious
lie
snug
for
another
week
but
you
might
have
stuck
to
mordecai
smith
and
so
been
led
to
their
hiding
place
said
in
that
case
should
have
wasted
my
day
think
that
it
is
hundred
to
one
against
smith
knowing
where
they
live
as
long
as
he
has
liquor
and
good
pay
why
should
he
ask
questions
they
send
him
messages
what
to
do
no
thought
over
every
possible
course
and
this
is
the
best
while
this
conversation
had
been
proceeding
we
had
been
shooting
the
long
series
of
bridges
which
span
the
thames
as
we
passed
the
city
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
were
gilding
the
cross
upon
the
summit
of
st
paul
it
was
twilight
before
we
reached
the
tower
that
is
jacobson
yard
said
holmes
pointing
to
bristle
of
masts
and
rigging
on
the
surrey
side
cruise
gently
up
and
down
here
under
cover
of
this
string
of
lighters
he
took
pair
of
night
glasses
from
his
pocket
and
gazed
some
time
at
the
shore
see
my
sentry
at
his
post
he
remarked
but
no
sign
of
handkerchief
suppose
we
go
down
stream
short
way
and
lie
in
wait
for
them
said
jones
eagerly
we
were
all
eager
by
this
time
even
the
policemen
and
stokers
who
had
very
vague
idea
of
what
was
going
forward
we
have
no
right
to
take
anything
for
granted
holmes
answered
it
is
certainly
ten
to
one
that
they
go
downstream
but
we
cannot
be
certain
from
this
point
we
can
see
the
entrance
of
the
yard
and
they
can
hardly
see
us
it
will
be
clear
night
and
plenty
of
light
we
must
stay
where
we
are
see
how
the
folk
swarm
over
yonder
in
the
gaslight
they
are
coming
from
work
in
the
yard
dirty
looking
rascals
but
suppose
every
one
has
some
little
immortal
spark
concealed
about
him
you
would
not
think
it
to
look
at
them
there
is
no
priori
probability
about
it
strange
enigma
is
man
someone
calls
him
soul
concealed
in
an
animal
suggested
winwood
reade
is
good
upon
the
subject
said
holmes
he
remarks
that
while
the
individual
man
is
an
insoluble
puzzle
in
the
aggregate
he
becomes
mathematical
certainty
you
can
for
example
never
foretell
what
any
one
man
will
do
but
you
can
say
with
precision
what
an
average
number
will
be
up
to
individuals
vary
but
percentages
remain
constant
so
says
the
statistician
but
do
see
handkerchief
surely
there
is
white
flutter
over
yonder
yes
it
is
your
boy
cried
can
see
him
plainly
and
there
is
the
aurora
exclaimed
holmes
and
going
like
the
devil
full
speed
ahead
engineer
make
after
that
launch
with
the
yellow
light
by
heaven
shall
never
forgive
myself
if
she
proves
to
have
the
heels
of
us
she
had
slipped
unseen
through
the
yard
entrance
and
passed
behind
two
or
three
small
craft
so
that
she
had
fairly
got
her
speed
up
before
we
saw
her
now
she
was
flying
down
the
stream
near
in
to
the
shore
going
at
tremendous
rate
jones
looked
gravely
at
her
and
shook
his
head
she
is
very
fast
he
said
doubt
if
we
shall
catch
her
we
must
catch
her
cried
holmes
between
his
teeth
heap
it
on
stokers
make
her
do
all
she
can
if
we
burn
the
boat
we
must
have
them
we
were
fairly
after
her
now
the
furnaces
roared
and
the
powerful
engines
whizzed
and
clanked
like
great
metallic
heart
her
sharp
steep
prow
cut
through
the
still
river
water
and
sent
two
rolling
waves
to
right
and
to
left
of
us
with
every
throb
of
the
engines
she
sprang
and
quivered
like
living
thing
one
great
yellow
lantern
in
our
bows
threw
long
flickering
funnel
of
light
in
front
of
us
right
ahead
dark
blur
upon
the
water
showed
where
the
aurora
lay
and
the
swirl
of
white
foam
behind
her
spoke
of
the
pace
at
which
she
was
going
we
flashed
past
barges
steamers
merchant
vessels
in
and
out
behind
this
one
and
round
the
other
voices
hailed
us
out
of
the
darkness
but
still
the
aurora
thundered
on
and
still
we
followed
close
upon
her
track
pile
it
on
men
pile
it
on
cried
holmes
looking
down
into
the
engine
room
while
the
fierce
glow
from
below
beat
upon
his
eager
aquiline
face
get
every
pound
of
steam
you
can
think
we
gain
little
said
jones
with
his
eyes
on
the
aurora
am
sure
of
it
said
we
shall
be
up
with
her
in
very
few
minutes
at
that
moment
however
as
our
evil
fate
would
have
it
tug
with
three
barges
in
tow
blundered
in
between
us
it
was
only
by
putting
our
helm
hard
down
that
we
avoided
collision
and
before
we
could
round
them
and
recover
our
way
the
aurora
had
gained
good
two
hundred
yards
she
was
still
however
well
in
view
and
the
murky
uncertain
twilight
was
setting
into
clear
starlit
night
our
boilers
were
strained
to
their
utmost
and
the
frail
shell
vibrated
and
creaked
with
the
fierce
energy
which
was
driving
us
along
we
had
shot
through
the
pool
past
the
west
india
docks
down
the
long
deptford
reach
and
up
again
after
rounding
the
isle
of
dogs
the
dull
blur
in
front
of
us
resolved
itself
now
clearly
enough
into
the
dainty
aurora
jones
turned
our
search
light
upon
her
so
that
we
could
plainly
see
the
figures
upon
her
deck
one
man
sat
by
the
stern
with
something
black
between
his
knees
over
which
he
stooped
beside
him
lay
dark
mass
which
looked
like
newfoundland
dog
the
boy
held
the
tiller
while
against
the
red
glare
of
the
furnace
could
see
old
smith
stripped
to
the
waist
and
shovelling
coals
for
dear
life
they
may
have
had
some
doubt
at
first
as
to
whether
we
were
really
pursuing
them
but
now
as
we
followed
every
winding
and
turning
which
they
took
there
could
no
longer
be
any
question
about
it
at
greenwich
we
were
about
three
hundred
paces
behind
them
at
blackwall
we
could
not
have
been
more
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
have
coursed
many
creatures
in
many
countries
during
my
checkered
career
but
never
did
sport
give
me
such
wild
thrill
as
this
mad
flying
man
hunt
down
the
thames
steadily
we
drew
in
upon
them
yard
by
yard
in
the
silence
of
the
night
we
could
hear
the
panting
and
clanking
of
their
machinery
the
man
in
the
stern
still
crouched
upon
the
deck
and
his
arms
were
moving
as
though
he
were
busy
while
every
now
and
then
he
would
look
up
and
measure
with
glance
the
distance
which
still
separated
us
nearer
we
came
and
nearer
jones
yelled
to
them
to
stop
we
were
not
more
than
four
boat
lengths
behind
them
both
boats
flying
at
tremendous
pace
it
was
clear
reach
of
the
river
with
barking
level
upon
one
side
and
the
melancholy
plumstead
marshes
upon
the
other
at
our
hail
the
man
in
the
stern
sprang
up
from
the
deck
and
shook
his
two
clinched
fists
at
us
cursing
the
while
in
high
cracked
voice
he
was
good
sized
powerful
man
and
as
he
stood
poising
himself
with
legs
astride
could
see
that
from
the
thigh
downwards
there
was
but
wooden
stump
upon
the
right
side
at
the
sound
of
his
strident
angry
cries
there
was
movement
in
the
huddled
bundle
upon
the
deck
it
straightened
itself
into
little
black
man
the
smallest
have
ever
seen
with
great
misshapen
head
and
shock
of
tangled
dishevelled
hair
holmes
had
already
drawn
his
revolver
and
whipped
out
mine
at
the
sight
of
this
savage
distorted
creature
he
was
wrapped
in
some
sort
of
dark
ulster
or
blanket
which
left
only
his
face
exposed
but
that
face
was
enough
to
give
man
sleepless
night
never
have
seen
features
so
deeply
marked
with
all
bestiality
and
cruelty
his
small
eyes
glowed
and
burned
with
sombre
light
and
his
thick
lips
were
writhed
back
from
his
teeth
which
grinned
and
chattered
at
us
with
half
animal
fury

fire
if
he
raises
his
hand
said
holmes
quietly
we
were
within
boat
length
by
this
time
and
almost
within
touch
of
our
quarry
can
see
the
two
of
them
now
as
they
stood
the
white
man
with
his
legs
far
apart
shrieking
out
curses
and
the
unhallowed
dwarf
with
his
hideous
face
and
his
strong
yellow
teeth
gnashing
at
us
in
the
light
of
our
lantern
it
was
well
that
we
had
so
clear
view
of
him
even
as
we
looked
he
plucked
out
from
under
his
covering
short
round
piece
of
wood
like
school
ruler
and
clapped
it
to
his
lips
our
pistols
rang
out
together
he
whirled
round
threw
up
his
arms
and
with
kind
of
choking
cough
fell
sideways
into
the
stream
caught
one
glimpse
of
his
venomous
menacing
eyes
amid
the
white
swirl
of
the
waters
at
the
same
moment
the
wooden
legged
man
threw
himself
upon
the
rudder
and
put
it
hard
down
so
that
his
boat
made
straight
in
for
the
southern
bank
while
we
shot
past
her
stern
only
clearing
her
by
few
feet
we
were
round
after
her
in
an
instant
but
she
was
already
nearly
at
the
bank
it
was
wild
and
desolate
place
where
the
moon
glimmered
upon
wide
expanse
of
marsh
land
with
pools
of
stagnant
water
and
beds
of
decaying
vegetation
the
launch
with
dull
thud
ran
up
upon
the
mud
bank
with
her
bow
in
the
air
and
her
stern
flush
with
the
water
the
fugitive
sprang
out
but
his
stump
instantly
sank
its
whole
length
into
the
sodden
soil
in
vain
he
struggled
and
writhed
not
one
step
could
he
possibly
take
either
forwards
or
backwards
he
yelled
in
impotent
rage
and
kicked
frantically
into
the
mud
with
his
other
foot
but
his
struggles
only
bored
his
wooden
pin
the
deeper
into
the
sticky
bank
when
we
brought
our
launch
alongside
he
was
so
firmly
anchored
that
it
was
only
by
throwing
the
end
of
rope
over
his
shoulders
that
we
were
able
to
haul
him
out
and
to
drag
him
like
some
evil
fish
over
our
side
the
two
smiths
father
and
son
sat
sullenly
in
their
launch
but
came
aboard
meekly
enough
when
commanded
the
aurora
herself
we
hauled
off
and
made
fast
to
our
stern
solid
iron
chest
of
indian
workmanship
stood
upon
the
deck
this
there
could
be
no
question
was
the
same
that
had
contained
the
illomened
treasure
of
the
sholtos
there
was
no
key
but
it
was
of
considerable
weight
so
we
transferred
it
carefully
to
our
own
little
cabin
as
we
steamed
slowly
up
stream
again
we
flashed
our
searchlight
in
every
direction
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
islander
somewhere
in
the
dark
ooze
at
the
bottom
of
the
thames
lie
the
bones
of
that
strange
visitor
to
our
shores
see
here
said
holmes
pointing
to
the
wooden
hatchway
we
were
hardly
quick
enough
with
our
pistols
there
sure
enough
just
behind
where
we
had
been
standing
stuck
one
of
those
murderous
darts
which
we
knew
so
well
it
must
have
whizzed
between
us
at
the
instant
that
we
fired
holmes
smiled
at
it
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
his
easy
fashion
but
confess
that
it
turned
me
sick
to
think
of
the
horrible
death
which
had
passed
so
close
to
us
that
night
xi
the
great
agra
treasure
our
captive
sat
in
the
cabin
opposite
to
the
iron
box
which
he
had
done
so
much
and
waited
so
long
to
gain
he
was
sunburned
reckless
eyed
fellow
with
network
of
lines
and
wrinkles
all
over
his
mahogany
features
which
told
of
hard
open
air
life
there
was
singular
prominence
about
his
bearded
chin
which
marked
man
who
was
not
to
be
easily
turned
from
his
purpose
his
age
may
have
been
fifty
or
thereabouts
for
his
black
curly
hair
was
thickly
shot
with
grey
his
face
in
repose
was
not
an
unpleasing
one
though
his
heavy
brows
and
aggressive
chin
gave
him
as
had
lately
seen
terrible
expression
when
moved
to
anger
he
sat
now
with
his
handcuffed
hands
upon
his
lap
and
his
head
sunk
upon
his
breast
while
he
looked
with
his
keen
twinkling
eyes
at
the
box
which
had
been
the
cause
of
his
ill
doings
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
more
sorrow
than
anger
in
his
rigid
and
contained
countenance
once
he
looked
up
at
me
with
gleam
of
something
like
humour
in
his
eyes
well
jonathan
small
said
holmes
lighting
cigar
am
sorry
that
it
has
come
to
this
and
so
am
sir
he
answered
frankly
don
believe
that
can
swing
over
the
job
give
you
my
word
on
the
book
that
never
raised
hand
against
mr
sholto
it
was
that
little
hell
hound
tonga
who
shot
one
of
his
cursed
darts
into
him
had
no
part
in
it
sir
was
as
grieved
as
if
it
had
been
my
blood
relation
welted
the
little
devil
with
the
slack
end
of
the
rope
for
it
but
it
was
done
and
could
not
undo
it
again
have
cigar
said
holmes
and
you
had
best
take
pull
out
of
my
flask
for
you
are
very
wet
how
could
you
expect
so
small
and
weak
man
as
this
black
fellow
to
overpower
mr
sholto
and
hold
him
while
you
were
climbing
the
rope
you
seem
to
know
as
much
about
it
as
if
you
were
there
sir
the
truth
is
that
hoped
to
find
the
room
clear
knew
the
habits
of
the
house
pretty
well
and
it
was
the
time
when
mr
sholto
usually
went
down
to
his
supper
shall
make
no
secret
of
the
business
the
best
defence
that
can
make
is
just
the
simple
truth
now
if
it
had
been
the
old
major
would
have
swung
for
him
with
light
heart
would
have
thought
no
more
of
knifing
him
than
of
smoking
this
cigar
but
it
cursed
hard
that
should
be
lagged
over
this
young
sholto
with
whom
had
no
quarrel
whatever
you
are
under
the
charge
of
mr
athelney
jones
of
scotland
yard
he
is
going
to
bring
you
up
to
my
rooms
and
shall
ask
you
for
true
account
of
the
matter
you
must
make
clean
breast
of
it
for
if
you
do
hope
that
may
be
of
use
to
you
think
can
prove
that
the
poison
acts
so
quickly
that
the
man
was
dead
before
ever
you
reached
the
room
that
he
was
sir
never
got
such
turn
in
my
life
as
when
saw
him
grinning
at
me
with
his
head
on
his
shoulder
as
climbed
through
the
window
it
fairly
shook
me
sir
have
half
killed
tonga
for
it
if
he
had
not
scrambled
off
that
was
how
he
came
to
leave
his
club
and
some
of
his
darts
too
as
he
tells
me
which
dare
say
helped
to
put
you
on
our
track
though
how
you
kept
on
it
is
more
than
can
tell
don
feel
no
malice
against
you
for
it
but
it
does
seem
queer
thing
he
added
with
bitter
smile
that
who
have
fair
claim
to
half
million
of
money
should
spend
the
first
half
of
my
life
building
breakwater
in
the
andamans
and
am
like
to
spend
the
other
half
digging
drains
at
dartmoor
it
was
an
evil
day
for
me
when
first
clapped
eyes
upon
the
merchant
achmet
and
had
to
do
with
the
agra
treasure
which
never
brought
anything
but
curse
yet
upon
the
man
who
owned
it
to
him
it
brought
murder
to
major
sholto
it
brought
fear
and
guilt
to
me
it
has
meant
slavery
for
life
at
this
moment
athelney
jones
thrust
his
broad
face
and
heavy
shoulders
into
the
tiny
cabin
quite
family
party
he
remarked
think
shall
have
pull
at
that
flask
holmes
well
think
we
may
all
congratulate
each
other
pity
we
didn
take
the
other
alive
but
there
was
no
choice
say
holmes
you
must
confess
that
you
cut
it
rather
fine
it
was
all
we
could
do
to
overhaul
her
all
is
well
that
ends
well
said
holmes
but
certainly
did
not
know
that
the
aurora
was
such
clipper
smith
says
she
is
one
of
the
fastest
launches
on
the
river
and
that
if
he
had
another
man
to
help
him
with
the
engines
we
should
never
have
caught
her
he
swears
he
knew
nothing
of
this
norwood
business
neither
he
did
cried
our
prisoner—
not
word
chose
his
launch
because
heard
that
she
was
flier
we
told
him
nothing
but
we
paid
him
well
and
he
was
to
get
something
handsome
if
we
reached
our
vessel
the
esmeralda
at
gravesend
outward
bound
for
the
brazils
well
if
he
has
done
no
wrong
we
shall
see
that
no
wrong
comes
to
him
if
we
are
pretty
quick
in
catching
our
men
we
are
not
so
quick
in
condemning
them
it
was
amusing
to
notice
how
the
consequential
jones
was
already
beginning
to
give
himself
airs
on
the
strength
of
the
capture
from
the
slight
smile
which
played
over
sherlock
holmes
face
could
see
that
the
speech
had
not
been
lost
upon
him
we
will
be
at
vauxhall
bridge
presently
said
jones
and
shall
land
you
dr
watson
with
the
treasure
box
need
hardly
tell
you
that
am
taking
very
grave
responsibility
upon
myself
in
doing
this
it
is
most
irregular
but
of
course
an
agreement
is
an
agreement
must
however
as
matter
of
duty
send
an
inspector
with
you
since
you
have
so
valuable
charge
you
will
drive
no
doubt
yes
shall
drive
it
is
pity
there
is
no
key
that
we
may
make
an
inventory
first
you
will
have
to
break
it
open
where
is
the
key
my
man
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
said
small
shortly
hum
there
was
no
use
your
giving
this
unnecessary
trouble
we
have
had
work
enough
already
through
you
however
doctor
need
not
warn
you
to
be
careful
bring
the
box
back
with
you
to
the
baker
street
rooms
you
will
find
us
there
on
our
way
to
the
station

they
landed
me
at
vauxhall
with
my
heavy
iron
box
and
with
bluff
genial
inspector
as
my
companion
quarter
of
an
hour
drive
brought
us
to
mrs
cecil
forrester
the
servant
seemed
surprised
at
so
late
visitor
mrs
cecil
forrester
was
out
for
the
evening
she
explained
and
likely
to
be
very
late
miss
morstan
however
was
in
the
drawing
room
so
to
the
drawing
room
went
box
in
hand
leaving
the
obliging
inspector
in
the
cab
she
was
seated
by
the
open
window
dressed
in
some
sort
of
white
diaphanous
material
with
little
touch
of
scarlet
at
the
neck
and
waist
the
soft
light
of
shaded
lamp
fell
upon
her
as
she
leaned
back
in
the
basket
chair
playing
over
her
sweet
grave
face
and
tinting
with
dull
metallic
sparkle
the
rich
coils
of
her
luxuriant
hair
one
white
arm
and
hand
drooped
over
the
side
of
the
chair
and
her
whole
pose
and
figure
spoke
of
an
absorbing
melancholy
at
the
sound
of
my
footfall
she
sprang
to
her
feet
however
and
bright
flush
of
surprise
and
of
pleasure
coloured
her
pale
cheeks
heard
cab
drive
up
she
said
thought
that
mrs
forrester
had
come
back
very
early
but
never
dreamed
that
it
might
be
you
what
news
have
you
brought
me
have
brought
something
better
than
news
said
putting
down
the
box
upon
the
table
and
speaking
jovially
and
boisterously
though
my
heart
was
heavy
within
me
have
brought
you
something
which
is
worth
all
the
news
in
the
world
have
brought
you
fortune
she
glanced
at
iron
box
is
that
the
treasure
then
she
asked
coolly
enough
yes
this
is
the
great
agra
treasure
half
of
it
is
yours
and
half
is
thaddeus
sholto
you
will
have
couple
of
hundred
thousand
each
think
of
that
an
annuity
of
ten
thousand
pounds
there
will
be
few
richer
young
ladies
in
england
is
it
not
glorious
think
that
must
have
been
rather
over
acting
my
delight
and
that
she
detected
hollow
ring
in
my
congratulations
for
saw
her
eyebrows
rise
little
and
she
glanced
at
me
curiously
if
have
it
said
she
owe
it
to
you
no
answered
not
to
me
but
to
my
friend
sherlock
holmes
with
all
the
will
in
the
world
could
never
have
followed
up
clue
which
has
taxed
even
his
analytical
genius
as
it
was
we
very
nearly
lost
it
at
the
last
moment
pray
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
about
it
dr
watson
said
she
narrated
briefly
what
had
occurred
since
had
seen
her
last
holmes
new
method
of
search
the
discovery
of
the
aurora
the
appearance
of
athelney
jones
our
expedition
in
the
evening
and
the
wild
chase
down
the
thames
she
listened
with
parted
lips
and
shining
eyes
to
my
recital
of
our
adventures
when
spoke
of
the
dart
which
had
so
narrowly
missed
us
she
turned
so
white
that
feared
that
she
was
about
to
faint
it
is
nothing
she
said
as
hastened
to
pour
her
out
some
water
am
all
right
again
it
was
shock
to
me
to
hear
that
had
placed
my
friends
in
such
horrible
peril
that
is
all
over
answered
it
was
nothing
will
tell
you
no
more
gloomy
details
let
us
turn
to
something
brighter
there
is
the
treasure
what
could
be
brighter
than
that
got
leave
to
bring
it
with
me
thinking
that
it
would
interest
you
to
be
the
first
to
see
it
would
be
of
the
greatest
interest
to
me
she
said
there
was
no
eagerness
in
her
voice
however
it
had
struck
her
doubtless
that
it
might
seem
ungracious
upon
her
part
to
be
indifferent
to
prize
which
had
cost
so
much
to
win
what
pretty
box
she
said
stooping
over
it
this
is
indian
work
suppose
yes
it
is
benares
metal
work
and
so
heavy
she
exclaimed
trying
to
raise
it
the
box
alone
must
be
of
some
value
where
is
the
key
small
threw
it
into
the
thames
answered
must
borrow
mrs
forrester
poker
there
was
in
the
front
thick
and
broad
hasp
wrought
in
the
image
of
sitting
buddha
under
this
thrust
the
end
of
the
poker
and
twisted
it
outward
as
lever
the
hasp
sprang
open
with
loud
snap
with
trembling
fingers
flung
back
the
lid
we
both
stood
gazing
in
astonishment
the
box
was
empty
no
wonder
that
it
was
heavy
the
iron
work
was
two
thirds
of
an
inch
thick
all
round
it
was
massive
well
made
and
solid
like
chest
constructed
to
carry
things
of
great
price
but
not
one
shred
or
crumb
of
metal
or
jewelry
lay
within
it
was
absolutely
and
completely
empty
the
treasure
is
lost
said
miss
morstan
calmly
as
listened
to
the
words
and
realized
what
they
meant
great
shadow
seemed
to
pass
from
my
soul
did
not
know
how
this
agra
treasure
had
weighed
me
down
until
now
that
it
was
finally
removed
it
was
selfish
no
doubt
disloyal
wrong
but
could
realize
nothing
save
that
the
golden
barrier
was
gone
from
between
us
thank
god
ejaculated
from
my
very
heart
she
looked
at
me
with
quick
questioning
smile
why
do
you
say
that
she
asked
because
you
are
within
my
reach
again
said
taking
her
hand
she
did
not
withdraw
it
because
love
you
mary
as
truly
as
ever
man
loved
woman
because
this
treasure
these
riches
sealed
my
lips
now
that
they
are
gone
can
tell
you
how
love
you
that
is
why
said
thank
god
then
say
thank
god
too
she
whispered
as
drew
her
to
my
side
whoever
had
lost
treasure
knew
that
night
that
had
gained
one
xii
the
strange
story
of
jonathan
small
very
patient
man
was
that
inspector
in
the
cab
for
it
was
weary
time
before
rejoined
him
his
face
clouded
over
when
showed
him
the
empty
box
there
goes
the
reward
said
he
gloomily
where
there
is
no
money
there
is
no
pay
this
night
work
would
have
been
worth
tenner
each
to
sam
brown
and
me
if
the
treasure
had
been
there
mr
thaddeus
sholto
is
rich
man
said
he
will
see
that
you
are
rewarded
treasure
or
no
the
inspector
shook
his
head
despondently
however
it
bad
job
he
repeated
and
so
mr
athelney
jones
will
think
his
forecast
proved
to
be
correct
for
the
detective
looked
blank
enough
when
got
to
baker
street
and
showed
him
the
empty
box
they
had
only
just
arrived
holmes
the
prisoner
and
he
for
they
had
changed
their
plans
so
far
as
to
report
themselves
at
station
upon
the
way
my
companion
lounged
in
his
armchair
with
his
usual
listless
expression
while
small
sat
stolidly
opposite
to
him
with
his
wooden
leg
cocked
over
his
sound
one
as
exhibited
the
empty
box
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
aloud
this
is
your
doing
small
said
athelney
jones
angrily
yes
have
put
it
away
where
you
shall
never
lay
hand
upon
it
he
cried
exultantly
it
is
my
treasure
and
if
can
have
the
loot
ll
take
darned
good
care
that
no
one
else
does
tell
you
that
no
living
man
has
any
right
to
it
unless
it
is
three
men
who
are
in
the
andaman
convict
barracks
and
myself
know
now
that
cannot
have
the
use
of
it
and
know
that
they
cannot
have
acted
all
through
for
them
as
much
as
for
myself
it
been
the
sign
of
four
with
us
always
well
know
that
they
would
have
had
me
do
just
what
have
done
and
throw
the
treasure
into
the
thames
rather
than
let
it
go
to
kith
or
kin
of
sholto
or
of
morstan
it
was
not
to
make
them
rich
that
we
did
for
achmet
you
ll
find
the
treasure
where
the
key
is
and
where
little
tonga
is
when
saw
that
your
launch
must
catch
us
put
the
loot
away
in
safe
place
there
are
no
rupees
for
you
this
journey
you
are
deceiving
us
small
said
athelney
jones
sternly
if
you
had
wished
to
throw
the
treasure
into
the
thames
it
would
have
been
easier
for
you
to
have
thrown
box
and
all
easier
for
me
to
throw
and
easier
for
you
to
recover
he
answered
with
shrewd
sidelong
look
the
man
that
was
clever
enough
to
hunt
me
down
is
clever
enough
to
pick
an
iron
box
from
the
bottom
of
river
now
that
they
are
scattered
over
five
miles
or
so
it
may
be
harder
job
it
went
to
my
heart
to
do
it
though
was
half
mad
when
you
came
up
with
us
however
there
no
good
grieving
over
it
ve
had
ups
in
my
life
and
ve
had
downs
but
ve
learned
not
to
cry
over
spilled
milk
this
is
very
serious
matter
small
said
the
detective
if
you
had
helped
justice
instead
of
thwarting
it
in
this
way
you
would
have
had
better
chance
at
your
trial
justice
snarled
the
ex
convict
pretty
justice
whose
loot
is
this
if
it
is
not
ours
where
is
the
justice
that
should
give
it
up
to
those
who
have
never
earned
it
look
how
have
earned
it
twenty
long
years
in
that
fever
ridden
swamp
all
day
at
work
under
the
mangrove
tree
all
night
chained
up
in
the
filthy
convict
huts
bitten
by
mosquitoes
racked
with
ague
bullied
by
every
cursed
black
faced
policeman
who
loved
to
take
it
out
of
white
man
that
was
how
earned
the
agra
treasure
and
you
talk
to
me
of
justice
because
cannot
bear
to
feel
that
have
paid
this
price
only
that
another
may
enjoy
it
would
rather
swing
score
of
times
or
have
one
of
tonga
darts
in
my
hide
than
live
in
convict
cell
and
feel
that
another
man
is
at
his
ease
in
palace
with
the
money
that
should
be
mine

had
dropped
his
mask
of
stoicism
and
all
this
came
out
in
wild
whirl
of
words
while
his
eyes
blazed
and
the
handcuffs
clanked
together
with
the
impassioned
movement
of
his
hands
could
understand
as
saw
the
fury
and
the
passion
of
the
man
that
it
was
no
groundless
or
unnatural
terror
which
had
possessed
major
sholto
when
he
first
learned
that
the
injured
convict
was
upon
his
track
you
forget
that
we
know
nothing
of
all
this
said
holmes
quietly
we
have
not
heard
your
story
and
we
cannot
tell
how
far
justice
may
originally
have
been
on
your
side
well
sir
you
have
been
very
fair
spoken
to
me
though
can
see
that
have
you
to
thank
that
have
these
bracelets
upon
my
wrists
still
bear
no
grudge
for
that
it
is
all
fair
and
above
board
if
you
want
to
hear
my
story
have
no
wish
to
hold
it
back
what
say
to
you
is
god
truth
every
word
of
it
thank
you
can
put
the
glass
beside
me
here
and
ll
put
my
lips
to
it
if
am
dry
am
worcestershire
man
myself
born
near
pershore
dare
say
you
would
find
heap
of
smalls
living
there
now
if
you
were
to
look
have
often
thought
of
taking
look
round
there
but
the
truth
is
that
was
never
much
of
credit
to
the
family
and
doubt
if
they
would
be
so
very
glad
to
see
me
they
were
all
steady
chapel
going
folk
small
farmers
well
known
and
respected
over
the
country
side
while
was
always
bit
of
rover
at
last
however
when
was
about
eighteen
gave
them
no
more
trouble
for
got
into
mess
over
girl
and
could
only
get
out
of
it
again
by
taking
the
queen
shilling
and
joining
the
third
buffs
which
was
just
starting
for
india
wasn
destined
to
do
much
soldiering
however
had
just
got
past
the
goose
step
and
learned
to
handle
my
musket
when
was
fool
enough
to
go
swimming
in
the
ganges
luckily
for
me
my
company
sergeant
john
holder
was
in
the
water
at
the
same
time
and
he
was
one
of
the
finest
swimmers
in
the
service
crocodile
took
me
just
as
was
half
way
across
and
nipped
off
my
right
leg
as
clean
as
surgeon
could
have
done
it
just
above
the
knee
what
with
the
shock
and
the
loss
of
blood
fainted
and
should
have
drowned
if
holder
had
not
caught
hold
of
me
and
paddled
for
the
bank
was
five
months
in
hospital
over
it
and
when
at
last
was
able
to
limp
out
of
it
with
this
timber
toe
strapped
to
my
stump
found
myself
invalided
out
of
the
army
and
unfitted
for
any
active
occupation
was
as
you
can
imagine
pretty
down
on
my
luck
at
this
time
for
was
useless
cripple
though
not
yet
in
my
twentieth
year
however
my
misfortune
soon
proved
to
be
blessing
in
disguise
man
named
abel
white
who
had
come
out
there
as
an
indigo
planter
wanted
an
overseer
to
look
after
his
coolies
and
keep
them
up
to
their
work
he
happened
to
be
friend
of
our
colonel
who
had
taken
an
interest
in
me
since
the
accident
to
make
long
story
short
the
colonel
recommended
me
strongly
for
the
post
and
as
the
work
was
mostly
to
be
done
on
horseback
my
leg
was
no
great
obstacle
for
had
enough
knee
left
to
keep
good
grip
on
the
saddle
what
had
to
do
was
to
ride
over
the
plantation
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
men
as
they
worked
and
to
report
the
idlers
the
pay
was
fair
had
comfortable
quarters
and
altogether
was
content
to
spend
the
remainder
of
my
life
in
indigo
planting
mr
abel
white
was
kind
man
and
he
would
often
drop
into
my
little
shanty
and
smoke
pipe
with
me
for
white
folk
out
there
feel
their
hearts
warm
to
each
other
as
they
never
do
here
at
home
well
was
never
in
luck
way
long
suddenly
without
note
of
warning
the
great
mutiny
broke
upon
us
one
month
india
lay
as
still
and
peaceful
to
all
appearance
as
surrey
or
kent
the
next
there
were
two
hundred
thousand
black
devils
let
loose
and
the
country
was
perfect
hell
of
course
you
know
all
about
it
gentlemen
deal
more
than
do
very
like
since
reading
is
not
in
my
line
only
know
what
saw
with
my
own
eyes
our
plantation
was
at
place
called
muttra
near
the
border
of
the
north
west
provinces
night
after
night
the
whole
sky
was
alight
with
the
burning
bungalows
and
day
after
day
we
had
small
companies
of
europeans
passing
through
our
estate
with
their
wives
and
children
on
their
way
to
agra
where
were
the
nearest
troops
mr
abel
white
was
an
obstinate
man
he
had
it
in
his
head
that
the
affair
had
been
exaggerated
and
that
it
would
blow
over
as
suddenly
as
it
had
sprung
up
there
he
sat
on
his
veranda
drinking
whiskey
pegs
and
smoking
cheroots
while
the
country
was
in
blaze
about
him
of
course
we
stuck
by
him
and
dawson
who
with
his
wife
used
to
do
the
book
work
and
the
managing
well
one
fine
day
the
crash
came
had
been
away
on
distant
plantation
and
was
riding
slowly
home
in
the
evening
when
my
eye
fell
upon
something
all
huddled
together
at
the
bottom
of
steep
nullah
rode
down
to
see
what
it
was
and
the
cold
struck
through
my
heart
when
found
it
was
dawson
wife
all
cut
into
ribbons
and
half
eaten
by
jackals
and
native
dogs
little
further
up
the
road
dawson
himself
was
lying
on
his
face
quite
dead
with
an
empty
revolver
in
his
hand
and
four
sepoys
lying
across
each
other
in
front
of
him
reined
up
my
horse
wondering
which
way
should
turn
but
at
that
moment
saw
thick
smoke
curling
up
from
abel
white
bungalow
and
the
flames
beginning
to
burst
through
the
roof
knew
then
that
could
do
my
employer
no
good
but
would
only
throw
my
own
life
away
if
meddled
in
the
matter
from
where
stood
could
see
hundreds
of
the
black
fiends
with
their
red
coats
still
on
their
backs
dancing
and
howling
round
the
burning
house
some
of
them
pointed
at
me
and
couple
of
bullets
sang
past
my
head
so
broke
away
across
the
paddy
fields
and
found
myself
late
at
night
safe
within
the
walls
at
agra
as
it
proved
however
there
was
no
great
safety
there
either
the
whole
country
was
up
like
swarm
of
bees
wherever
the
english
could
collect
in
little
bands
they
held
just
the
ground
that
their
guns
commanded
everywhere
else
they
were
helpless
fugitives
it
was
fight
of
the
millions
against
the
hundreds
and
the
cruellest
part
of
it
was
that
these
men
that
we
fought
against
foot
horse
and
gunners
were
our
own
picked
troops
whom
we
had
taught
and
trained
handling
our
own
weapons
and
blowing
our
own
bugle
calls
at
agra
there
were
the
3rd
bengal
fusiliers
some
sikhs
two
troops
of
horse
and
battery
of
artillery
volunteer
corps
of
clerks
and
merchants
had
been
formed
and
this
joined
wooden
leg
and
all
we
went
out
to
meet
the
rebels
at
shahgunge
early
in
july
and
we
beat
them
back
for
time
but
our
powder
gave
out
and
we
had
to
fall
back
upon
the
city
nothing
but
the
worst
news
came
to
us
from
every
side
which
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
for
if
you
look
at
the
map
you
will
see
that
we
were
right
in
the
heart
of
it
lucknow
is
rather
better
than
hundred
miles
to
the
east
and
cawnpore
about
as
far
to
the
south
from
every
point
on
the
compass
there
was
nothing
but
torture
and
murder
and
outrage
the
city
of
agra
is
great
place
swarming
with
fanatics
and
fierce
devil
worshippers
of
all
sorts
our
handful
of
men
were
lost
among
the
narrow
winding
streets
our
leader
moved
across
the
river
therefore
and
took
up
his
position
in
the
old
fort
at
agra
don
know
if
any
of
you
gentlemen
have
ever
read
or
heard
anything
of
that
old
fort
it
is
very
queer
place
the
queerest
that
ever
was
in
and
have
been
in
some
rum
corners
too
first
of
all
it
is
enormous
in
size
should
think
that
the
enclosure
must
be
acres
and
acres
there
is
modern
part
which
took
all
our
garrison
women
children
stores
and
everything
else
with
plenty
of
room
over
but
the
modern
part
is
nothing
like
the
size
of
the
old
quarter
where
nobody
goes
and
which
is
given
over
to
the
scorpions
and
the
centipedes
it
is
all
full
of
great
deserted
halls
and
winding
passages
and
long
corridors
twisting
in
and
out
so
that
it
is
easy
enough
for
folk
to
get
lost
in
it
for
this
reason
it
was
seldom
that
any
one
went
into
it
though
now
and
again
party
with
torches
might
go
exploring
the
river
washes
along
the
front
of
the
old
fort
and
so
protects
it
but
on
the
sides
and
behind
there
are
many
doors
and
these
had
to
be
guarded
of
course
in
the
old
quarter
as
well
as
in
that
which
was
actually
held
by
our
troops
we
were
short
handed
with
hardly
men
enough
to
man
the
angles
of
the
building
and
to
serve
the
guns
it
was
impossible
for
us
therefore
to
station
strong
guard
at
every
one
of
the
innumerable
gates
what
we
did
was
to
organize
central
guard
house
in
the
middle
of
the
fort
and
to
leave
each
gate
under
the
charge
of
one
white
man
and
two
or
three
natives
was
selected
to
take
charge
during
certain
hours
of
the
night
of
small
isolated
door
upon
the
southwest
side
of
the
building
two
sikh
troopers
were
placed
under
my
command
and
was
instructed
if
anything
went
wrong
to
fire
my
musket
when
might
rely
upon
help
coming
at
once
from
the
central
guard
as
the
guard
was
good
two
hundred
paces
away
however
and
as
the
space
between
was
cut
up
into
labyrinth
of
passages
and
corridors
had
great
doubts
as
to
whether
they
could
arrive
in
time
to
be
of
any
use
in
case
of
an
actual
attack

well
was
pretty
proud
at
having
this
small
command
given
me
since
was
raw
recruit
and
game
legged
one
at
that
for
two
nights
kept
the
watch
with
my
punjabees
they
were
tall
fierce
looking
chaps
mahomet
singh
and
abdullah
khan
by
name
both
old
fighting
men
who
had
borne
arms
against
us
at
chilian
wallah
they
could
talk
english
pretty
well
but
could
get
little
out
of
them
they
preferred
to
stand
together
and
jabber
all
night
in
their
queer
sikh
lingo
for
myself
used
to
stand
outside
the
gateway
looking
down
on
the
broad
winding
river
and
on
the
twinkling
lights
of
the
great
city
the
beating
of
drums
the
rattle
of
tom
toms
and
the
yells
and
howls
of
the
rebels
drunk
with
opium
and
with
bhang
were
enough
to
remind
us
all
night
of
our
dangerous
neighbors
across
the
stream
every
two
hours
the
officer
of
the
night
used
to
come
round
to
all
the
posts
to
make
sure
that
all
was
well
the
third
night
of
my
watch
was
dark
and
dirty
with
small
driving
rain
it
was
dreary
work
standing
in
the
gateway
hour
after
hour
in
such
weather
tried
again
and
again
to
make
my
sikhs
talk
but
without
much
success
at
two
in
the
morning
the
rounds
passed
and
broke
for
moment
the
weariness
of
the
night
finding
that
my
companions
would
not
be
led
into
conversation
took
out
my
pipe
and
laid
down
my
musket
to
strike
the
match
in
an
instant
the
two
sikhs
were
upon
me
one
of
them
snatched
my
firelock
up
and
levelled
it
at
my
head
while
the
other
held
great
knife
to
my
throat
and
swore
between
his
teeth
that
he
would
plunge
it
into
me
if
moved
step
my
first
thought
was
that
these
fellows
were
in
league
with
the
rebels
and
that
this
was
the
beginning
of
an
assault
if
our
door
were
in
the
hands
of
the
sepoys
the
place
must
fall
and
the
women
and
children
be
treated
as
they
were
in
cawnpore
maybe
you
gentlemen
think
that
am
just
making
out
case
for
myself
but
give
you
my
word
that
when
thought
of
that
though
felt
the
point
of
the
knife
at
my
throat
opened
my
mouth
with
the
intention
of
giving
scream
if
it
was
my
last
one
which
might
alarm
the
main
guard
the
man
who
held
me
seemed
to
know
my
thoughts
for
even
as
braced
myself
to
it
he
whispered
don
make
noise
the
fort
is
safe
enough
there
are
no
rebel
dogs
on
this
side
of
the
river
there
was
the
ring
of
truth
in
what
he
said
and
knew
that
if
raised
my
voice
was
dead
man
could
read
it
in
the
fellow
brown
eyes
waited
therefore
in
silence
to
see
what
it
was
that
they
wanted
from
me
listen
to
me
sahib
said
the
taller
and
fiercer
of
the
pair
the
one
whom
they
called
abdullah
khan
you
must
either
be
with
us
now
or
you
must
be
silenced
forever
the
thing
is
too
great
one
for
us
to
hesitate
either
you
are
heart
and
soul
with
us
on
your
oath
on
the
cross
of
the
christians
or
your
body
this
night
shall
be
thrown
into
the
ditch
and
we
shall
pass
over
to
our
brothers
in
the
rebel
army
there
is
no
middle
way
which
is
it
to
be
death
or
life
we
can
only
give
you
three
minutes
to
decide
for
the
time
is
passing
and
all
must
be
done
before
the
rounds
come
again
how
can
decide
said
you
have
not
told
me
what
you
want
of
me
but
tell
you
now
that
if
it
is
anything
against
the
safety
of
the
fort
will
have
no
truck
with
it
so
you
can
drive
home
your
knife
and
welcome
it
is
nothing
against
the
fort
said
he
we
only
ask
you
to
do
that
which
your
countrymen
come
to
this
land
for
we
ask
you
to
be
rich
if
you
will
be
one
of
us
this
night
we
will
swear
to
you
upon
the
naked
knife
and
by
the
threefold
oath
which
no
sikh
was
ever
known
to
break
that
you
shall
have
your
fair
share
of
the
loot
quarter
of
the
treasure
shall
be
yours
we
can
say
no
fairer
but
what
is
the
treasure
then
asked
am
as
ready
to
be
rich
as
you
can
be
if
you
will
but
show
me
how
it
can
be
done
you
will
swear
then
said
he
by
the
bones
of
your
father
by
the
honour
of
your
mother
by
the
cross
of
your
faith
to
raise
no
hand
and
speak
no
word
against
us
either
now
or
afterwards
will
swear
it
answered
provided
that
the
fort
is
not
endangered
then
my
comrade
and
will
swear
that
you
shall
have
quarter
of
the
treasure
which
shall
be
equally
divided
among
the
four
of
us
there
are
but
three
said
no
dost
akbar
must
have
his
share
we
can
tell
the
tale
to
you
while
we
await
them
do
you
stand
at
the
gate
mahomet
singh
and
give
notice
of
their
coming
the
thing
stands
thus
sahib
and
tell
it
to
you
because
know
that
an
oath
is
binding
upon
feringhee
and
that
we
may
trust
you
had
you
been
lying
hindoo
though
you
had
sworn
by
all
the
gods
in
their
false
temples
your
blood
would
have
been
upon
the
knife
and
your
body
in
the
water
but
the
sikh
knows
the
englishman
and
the
englishman
knows
the
sikh
hearken
then
to
what
have
to
say
there
is
rajah
in
the
northern
provinces
who
has
much
wealth
though
his
lands
are
small
much
has
come
to
him
from
his
father
and
more
still
he
has
set
by
himself
for
he
is
of
low
nature
and
hoards
his
gold
rather
than
spend
it
when
the
troubles
broke
out
he
would
be
friends
both
with
the
lion
and
the
tiger
with
the
sepoy
and
with
the
company
raj
soon
however
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
white
men
day
was
come
for
through
all
the
land
he
could
hear
of
nothing
but
of
their
death
and
their
overthrow
yet
being
careful
man
he
made
such
plans
that
come
what
might
half
at
least
of
his
treasure
should
be
left
to
him
that
which
was
in
gold
and
silver
he
kept
by
him
in
the
vaults
of
his
palace
but
the
most
precious
stones
and
the
choicest
pearls
that
he
had
he
put
in
an
iron
box
and
sent
it
by
trusty
servant
who
under
the
guise
of
merchant
should
take
it
to
the
fort
at
agra
there
to
lie
until
the
land
is
at
peace
thus
if
the
rebels
won
he
would
have
his
money
but
if
the
company
conquered
his
jewels
would
be
saved
to
him
having
thus
divided
his
hoard
he
threw
himself
into
the
cause
of
the
sepoys
since
they
were
strong
upon
his
borders
by
doing
this
mark
you
sahib
his
property
becomes
the
due
of
those
who
have
been
true
to
their
salt
this
pretended
merchant
who
travels
under
the
name
of
achmet
is
now
in
the
city
of
agra
and
desires
to
gain
his
way
into
the
fort
he
has
with
him
as
travelling
companion
my
foster
brother
dost
akbar
who
knows
his
secret
dost
akbar
has
promised
this
night
to
lead
him
to
side
postern
of
the
fort
and
has
chosen
this
one
for
his
purpose
here
he
will
come
presently
and
here
he
will
find
mahomet
singh
and
myself
awaiting
him
the
place
is
lonely
and
none
shall
know
of
his
coming
the
world
shall
know
of
the
merchant
achmet
no
more
but
the
great
treasure
of
the
rajah
shall
be
divided
among
us
what
say
you
to
it
sahib
in
worcestershire
the
life
of
man
seems
great
and
sacred
thing
but
it
is
very
different
when
there
is
fire
and
blood
all
round
you
and
you
have
been
used
to
meeting
death
at
every
turn
whether
achmet
the
merchant
lived
or
died
was
thing
as
light
as
air
to
me
but
at
the
talk
about
the
treasure
my
heart
turned
to
it
and
thought
of
what
might
do
in
the
old
country
with
it
and
how
my
folk
would
stare
when
they
saw
their
ne
er
do
well
coming
back
with
his
pockets
full
of
gold
moidores
had
therefore
already
made
up
my
mind
abdullah
khan
however
thinking
that
hesitated
pressed
the
matter
more
closely
consider
sahib
said
he
that
if
this
man
is
taken
by
the
commandant
he
will
be
hung
or
shot
and
his
jewels
taken
by
the
government
so
that
no
man
will
be
rupee
the
better
for
them
now
since
we
do
the
taking
of
him
why
should
we
not
do
the
rest
as
well
the
jewels
will
be
as
well
with
us
as
in
the
company
coffers
there
will
be
enough
to
make
every
one
of
us
rich
men
and
great
chiefs
no
one
can
know
about
the
matter
for
here
we
are
cut
off
from
all
men
what
could
be
better
for
the
purpose
say
again
then
sahib
whether
you
are
with
us
or
if
we
must
look
upon
you
as
an
enemy
am
with
you
heart
and
soul
said
it
is
well
he
answered
handing
me
back
my
firelock
you
see
that
we
trust
you
for
your
word
like
ours
is
not
to
be
broken
we
have
now
only
to
wait
for
my
brother
and
the
merchant
does
your
brother
know
then
of
what
you
will
do
asked
the
plan
is
his
he
has
devised
it
we
will
go
to
the
gate
and
share
the
watch
with
mahomet
singh
the
rain
was
still
falling
steadily
for
it
was
just
the
beginning
of
the
wet
season
brown
heavy
clouds
were
drifting
across
the
sky
and
it
was
hard
to
see
more
than
stone
cast
deep
moat
lay
in
front
of
our
door
but
the
water
was
in
places
nearly
dried
up
and
it
could
easily
be
crossed
it
was
strange
to
me
to
be
standing
there
with
those
two
wild
punjabees
waiting
for
the
man
who
was
coming
to
his
death
suddenly
my
eye
caught
the
glint
of
shaded
lantern
at
the
other
side
of
the
moat
it
vanished
among
the
mound
heaps
and
then
appeared
again
coming
slowly
in
our
direction

here
they
are
exclaimed
you
will
challenge
him
sahib
as
usual
whispered
abdullah
give
him
no
cause
for
fear
send
us
in
with
him
and
we
shall
do
the
rest
while
you
stay
here
on
guard
have
the
lantern
ready
to
uncover
that
we
may
be
sure
that
it
is
indeed
the
man
the
light
had
flickered
onwards
now
stopping
and
now
advancing
until
could
see
two
dark
figures
upon
the
other
side
of
the
moat
let
them
scramble
down
the
sloping
bank
splash
through
the
mire
and
climb
half
way
up
to
the
gate
before
challenged
them
who
goes
there
said
in
subdued
voice
friends
came
the
answer
uncovered
my
lantern
and
threw
flood
of
light
upon
them
the
first
was
an
enormous
sikh
with
black
beard
which
swept
nearly
down
to
his
cummerbund
outside
of
show
have
never
seen
so
tall
man
the
other
was
little
fat
round
fellow
with
great
yellow
turban
and
bundle
in
his
hand
done
up
in
shawl
he
seemed
to
be
all
in
quiver
with
fear
for
his
hands
twitched
as
if
he
had
the
ague
and
his
head
kept
turning
to
left
and
right
with
two
bright
little
twinkling
eyes
like
mouse
when
he
ventures
out
from
his
hole
it
gave
me
the
chills
to
think
of
killing
him
but
thought
of
the
treasure
and
my
heart
set
as
hard
as
flint
within
me
when
he
saw
my
white
face
he
gave
little
chirrup
of
joy
and
came
running
up
towards
me
your
protection
sahib
he
panted
your
protection
for
the
unhappy
merchant
achmet
have
travelled
across
rajpootana
that
might
seek
the
shelter
of
the
fort
at
agra
have
been
robbed
and
beaten
and
abused
because
have
been
the
friend
of
the
company
it
is
blessed
night
this
when
am
once
more
in
safety
and
my
poor
possessions
what
have
you
in
the
bundle
asked
an
iron
box
he
answered
which
contains
one
or
two
little
family
matters
which
are
of
no
value
to
others
but
which
should
be
sorry
to
lose
yet
am
not
beggar
and
shall
reward
you
young
sahib
and
your
governor
also
if
he
will
give
me
the
shelter
ask
could
not
trust
myself
to
speak
longer
with
the
man
the
more
looked
at
his
fat
frightened
face
the
harder
did
it
seem
that
we
should
slay
him
in
cold
blood
it
was
best
to
get
it
over
take
him
to
the
main
guard
said
the
two
sikhs
closed
in
upon
him
on
each
side
and
the
giant
walked
behind
while
they
marched
in
through
the
dark
gateway
never
was
man
so
compassed
round
with
death
remained
at
the
gateway
with
the
lantern
could
hear
the
measured
tramp
of
their
footsteps
sounding
through
the
lonely
corridors
suddenly
it
ceased
and
heard
voices
and
scuffle
with
the
sound
of
blows
moment
later
there
came
to
my
horror
rush
of
footsteps
coming
in
my
direction
with
the
loud
breathing
of
running
man
turned
my
lantern
down
the
long
straight
passage
and
there
was
the
fat
man
running
like
the
wind
with
smear
of
blood
across
his
face
and
close
at
his
heels
bounding
like
tiger
the
great
black
bearded
sikh
with
knife
flashing
in
his
hand
have
never
seen
man
run
so
fast
as
that
little
merchant
he
was
gaining
on
the
sikh
and
could
see
that
if
he
once
passed
me
and
got
to
the
open
air
he
would
save
himself
yet
my
heart
softened
to
him
but
again
the
thought
of
his
treasure
turned
me
hard
and
bitter
cast
my
firelock
between
his
legs
as
he
raced
past
and
he
rolled
twice
over
like
shot
rabbit
ere
he
could
stagger
to
his
feet
the
sikh
was
upon
him
and
buried
his
knife
twice
in
his
side
the
man
never
uttered
moan
nor
moved
muscle
but
lay
were
he
had
fallen
think
myself
that
he
may
have
broken
his
neck
with
the
fall
you
see
gentlemen
that
am
keeping
my
promise
am
telling
you
every
work
of
the
business
just
exactly
as
it
happened
whether
it
is
in
my
favour
or
not
he
stopped
and
held
out
his
manacled
hands
for
the
whisky
and
water
which
holmes
had
brewed
for
him
for
myself
confess
that
had
now
conceived
the
utmost
horror
of
the
man
not
only
for
this
cold
blooded
business
in
which
he
had
been
concerned
but
even
more
for
the
somewhat
flippant
and
careless
way
in
which
he
narrated
it
whatever
punishment
was
in
store
for
him
felt
that
he
might
expect
no
sympathy
from
me
sherlock
holmes
and
jones
sat
with
their
hands
upon
their
knees
deeply
interested
in
the
story
but
with
the
same
disgust
written
upon
their
faces
he
may
have
observed
it
for
there
was
touch
of
defiance
in
his
voice
and
manner
as
he
proceeded
it
was
all
very
bad
no
doubt
said
he
should
like
to
know
how
many
fellows
in
my
shoes
would
have
refused
share
of
this
loot
when
they
knew
that
they
would
have
their
throats
cut
for
their
pains
besides
it
was
my
life
or
his
when
once
he
was
in
the
fort
if
he
had
got
out
the
whole
business
would
come
to
light
and
should
have
been
court
martialled
and
shot
as
likely
as
not
for
people
were
not
very
lenient
at
time
like
that
go
on
with
your
story
said
holmes
shortly
well
we
carried
him
in
abdullah
akbar
and
fine
weight
he
was
too
for
all
that
he
was
so
short
mahomet
singh
was
left
to
guard
the
door
we
took
him
to
place
which
the
sikhs
had
already
prepared
it
was
some
distance
off
where
winding
passage
leads
to
great
empty
hall
the
brick
walls
of
which
were
all
crumbling
to
pieces
the
earth
floor
had
sunk
in
at
one
place
making
natural
grave
so
we
left
achmet
the
merchant
there
having
first
covered
him
over
with
loose
bricks
this
done
we
all
went
back
to
the
treasure
it
lay
where
he
had
dropped
it
when
he
was
first
attacked
the
box
was
the
same
which
now
lies
open
upon
your
table
key
was
hung
by
silken
cord
to
that
carved
handle
upon
the
top
we
opened
it
and
the
light
of
the
lantern
gleamed
upon
collection
of
gems
such
as
have
read
of
and
thought
about
when
was
little
lad
at
pershore
it
was
blinding
to
look
upon
them
when
we
had
feasted
our
eyes
we
took
them
all
out
and
made
list
of
them
there
were
one
hundred
and
forty
three
diamonds
of
the
first
water
including
one
which
has
been
called
believe
the
great
mogul
and
is
said
to
be
the
second
largest
stone
in
existence
then
there
were
ninety
seven
very
fine
emeralds
and
one
hundred
and
seventy
rubies
some
of
which
however
were
small
there
were
forty
carbuncles
two
hundred
and
ten
sapphires
sixty
one
agates
and
great
quantity
of
beryls
onyxes
cats
eyes
turquoises
and
other
stones
the
very
names
of
which
did
not
know
at
the
time
though
have
become
more
familiar
with
them
since
besides
this
there
were
nearly
three
hundred
very
fine
pearls
twelve
of
which
were
set
in
gold
coronet
by
the
way
these
last
had
been
taken
out
of
the
chest
and
were
not
there
when
recovered
it
after
we
had
counted
our
treasures
we
put
them
back
into
the
chest
and
carried
them
to
the
gateway
to
show
them
to
mahomet
singh
then
we
solemnly
renewed
our
oath
to
stand
by
each
other
and
be
true
to
our
secret
we
agreed
to
conceal
our
loot
in
safe
place
until
the
country
should
be
at
peace
again
and
then
to
divide
it
equally
among
ourselves
there
was
no
use
dividing
it
at
present
for
if
gems
of
such
value
were
found
upon
us
it
would
cause
suspicion
and
there
was
no
privacy
in
the
fort
nor
any
place
where
we
could
keep
them
we
carried
the
box
therefore
into
the
same
hall
where
we
had
buried
the
body
and
there
under
certain
bricks
in
the
best
preserved
wall
we
made
hollow
and
put
our
treasure
we
made
careful
note
of
the
place
and
next
day
drew
four
plans
one
for
each
of
us
and
put
the
sign
of
the
four
of
us
at
the
bottom
for
we
had
sworn
that
we
should
each
always
act
for
all
so
that
none
might
take
advantage
that
is
an
oath
that
can
put
my
hand
to
my
heart
and
swear
that
have
never
broken
well
there
no
use
my
telling
you
gentlemen
what
came
of
the
indian
mutiny
after
wilson
took
delhi
and
sir
colin
relieved
lucknow
the
back
of
the
business
was
broken
fresh
troops
came
pouring
in
and
nana
sahib
made
himself
scarce
over
the
frontier
flying
column
under
colonel
greathed
came
round
to
agra
and
cleared
the
pandies
away
from
it
peace
seemed
to
be
settling
upon
the
country
and
we
four
were
beginning
to
hope
that
the
time
was
at
hand
when
we
might
safely
go
off
with
our
shares
of
the
plunder
in
moment
however
our
hopes
were
shattered
by
our
being
arrested
as
the
murderers
of
achmet
it
came
about
in
this
way
when
the
rajah
put
his
jewels
into
the
hands
of
achmet
he
did
it
because
he
knew
that
he
was
trusty
man
they
are
suspicious
folk
in
the
east
however
so
what
does
this
rajah
do
but
take
second
even
more
trusty
servant
and
set
him
to
play
the
spy
upon
the
first
this
second
man
was
ordered
never
to
let
achmet
out
of
his
sight
and
he
followed
him
like
his
shadow
he
went
after
him
that
night
and
saw
him
pass
through
the
doorway
of
course
he
thought
he
had
taken
refuge
in
the
fort
and
applied
for
admission
there
himself
next
day
but
could
find
no
trace
of
achmet
this
seemed
to
him
so
strange
that
he
spoke
about
it
to
sergeant
of
guides
who
brought
it
to
the
ears
of
the
commandant
thorough
search
was
quickly
made
and
the
body
was
discovered
thus
at
the
very
moment
that
we
thought
that
all
was
safe
we
were
all
four
seized
and
brought
to
trial
on
charge
of
murder
three
of
us
because
we
had
held
the
gate
that
night
and
the
fourth
because
he
was
known
to
have
been
in
the
company
of
the
murdered
man
not
word
about
the
jewels
came
out
at
the
trial
for
the
rajah
had
been
deposed
and
driven
out
of
india
so
no
one
had
any
particular
interest
in
them
the
murder
however
was
clearly
made
out
and
it
was
certain
that
we
must
all
have
been
concerned
in
it
the
three
sikhs
got
penal
servitude
for
life
and
was
condemned
to
death
though
my
sentence
was
afterwards
commuted
into
the
same
as
the
others
it
was
rather
queer
position
that
we
found
ourselves
in
then
there
we
were
all
four
tied
by
the
leg
and
with
precious
little
chance
of
ever
getting
out
again
while
we
each
held
secret
which
might
have
put
each
of
us
in
palace
if
we
could
only
have
made
use
of
it
was
enough
to
make
man
eat
his
heart
out
to
have
to
stand
the
kick
and
the
cuff
of
every
petty
jack
in
office
to
have
rice
to
eat
and
water
to
drink
when
that
gorgeous
fortune
was
ready
for
him
outside
just
waiting
to
be
picked
up
it
might
have
driven
me
mad
but
was
always
pretty
stubborn
one
so
just
held
on
and
bided
my
time
at
last
it
seemed
to
me
to
have
come
was
changed
from
agra
to
madras
and
from
there
to
blair
island
in
the
andamans
there
are
very
few
white
convicts
at
this
settlement
and
as
had
behaved
well
from
the
first
soon
found
myself
sort
of
privileged
person
was
given
hut
in
hope
town
which
is
small
place
on
the
slopes
of
mount
harriet
and
was
left
pretty
much
to
myself
it
is
dreary
fever
stricken
place
and
all
beyond
our
little
clearings
was
infested
with
wild
cannibal
natives
who
were
ready
enough
to
blow
poisoned
dart
at
us
if
they
saw
chance
there
was
digging
and
ditching
and
yam
planting
and
dozen
other
things
to
be
done
so
we
were
busy
enough
al
day
though
in
the
evening
we
had
little
time
to
ourselves
among
other
things
learned
to
dispense
drugs
for
the
surgeon
and
picked
up
smattering
of
his
knowledge
all
the
time
was
on
the
lookout
for
chance
of
escape
but
it
is
hundreds
of
miles
from
any
other
land
and
there
is
little
or
no
wind
in
those
seas
so
it
was
terribly
difficult
job
to
get
away
the
surgeon
dr
somerton
was
fast
sporting
young
chap
and
the
other
young
officers
would
meet
in
his
rooms
of
an
evening
and
play
cards
the
surgery
where
used
to
make
up
my
drugs
was
next
to
his
sitting
room
with
small
window
between
us
often
if
felt
lonesome
used
to
turn
out
the
lamp
in
the
surgery
and
then
standing
there
could
hear
their
talk
and
watch
their
play
am
fond
of
hand
at
cards
myself
and
it
was
almost
as
good
as
having
one
to
watch
the
others
there
was
major
sholto
captain
morstan
and
lieutenant
bromley
brown
who
were
in
command
of
the
native
troops
and
there
was
the
surgeon
himself
and
two
or
three
prison
officials
crafty
old
hands
who
played
nice
sly
safe
game
very
snug
little
party
they
used
to
make
well
there
was
one
thing
which
very
soon
struck
me
and
that
was
that
the
soldiers
used
always
to
lose
and
the
civilians
to
win
mind
don
say
that
there
was
anything
unfair
but
so
it
was
these
prison
chaps
had
done
little
else
than
play
cards
ever
since
they
had
been
at
the
andamans
and
they
knew
each
other
game
to
point
while
the
others
just
played
to
pass
the
time
and
threw
their
cards
down
anyhow
night
after
night
the
soldiers
got
up
poorer
men
and
the
poorer
they
got
the
more
keen
they
were
to
play
major
sholto
was
the
hardest
hit
he
used
to
pay
in
notes
and
gold
at
first
but
soon
it
came
to
notes
of
hand
and
for
big
sums
he
sometimes
would
win
for
few
deals
just
to
give
him
heart
and
then
the
luck
would
set
in
against
him
worse
than
ever
all
day
he
would
wander
about
as
black
as
thunder
and
he
took
to
drinking
deal
more
than
was
good
for
him
one
night
he
lost
even
more
heavily
than
usual
was
sitting
in
my
hut
when
he
and
captain
morstan
came
stumbling
along
on
the
way
to
their
quarters
they
were
bosom
friends
those
two
and
never
far
apart
the
major
was
raving
about
his
losses
it
all
up
morstan
he
was
saying
as
they
passed
my
hut
shall
have
to
send
in
my
papers
am
ruined
man
nonsense
old
chap
said
the
other
slapping
him
upon
the
shoulder
ve
had
nasty
facer
myself
but—
that
was
all
could
hear
but
it
was
enough
to
set
me
thinking
couple
of
days
later
major
sholto
was
strolling
on
the
beach
so
took
the
chance
of
speaking
to
him
wish
to
have
your
advice
major
said
well
small
what
is
it
he
asked
taking
his
cheroot
from
his
lips
wanted
to
ask
you
sir
said
who
is
the
proper
person
to
whom
hidden
treasure
should
be
handed
over
know
where
half
million
worth
lies
and
as
cannot
use
it
myself
thought
perhaps
the
best
thing
that
could
do
would
be
to
hand
it
over
to
the
proper
authorities
and
then
perhaps
they
would
get
my
sentence
shortened
for
me
half
million
small
he
gasped
looking
hard
at
me
to
see
if
was
in
earnest
quite
that
sir
in
jewels
and
pearls
it
lies
there
ready
for
any
one
and
the
queer
thing
about
it
is
that
the
real
owner
is
outlawed
and
cannot
hold
property
so
that
it
belongs
to
the
first
comer
to
government
small
he
stammered—
to
government
but
he
said
it
in
halting
fashion
and
knew
in
my
heart
that
had
got
him
you
think
then
sir
that
should
give
the
information
to
the
governor
general
said
quietly
well
you
must
not
do
anything
rash
or
that
you
might
repent
let
me
hear
all
about
it
small
give
me
the
facts
told
him
the
whole
story
with
small
changes
so
that
he
could
not
identify
the
places
when
had
finished
he
stood
stock
still
and
full
of
thought
could
see
by
the
twitch
of
his
lip
that
there
was
struggle
going
on
within
him
this
is
very
important
matter
small
he
said
at
last
you
must
not
say
word
to
anyone
about
it
and
shall
see
you
again
soon
two
nights
later
he
and
his
friend
captain
morstan
came
to
my
hut
in
the
dead
of
the
night
with
lantern
want
you
just
to
let
captain
morstan
hear
that
story
from
your
own
lips
small
said
he
repeated
it
as
had
told
it
before
it
rings
true
eh
said
he
it
good
enough
to
act
upon
captain
morstan
nodded
look
here
small
said
the
major
we
have
been
talking
it
over
my
friend
here
and
we
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
secret
of
yours
is
hardly
government
matter
after
all
but
is
private
concern
of
your
own
which
of
course
you
have
the
power
of
disposing
of
as
you
think
best
now
the
question
is
what
price
would
you
ask
for
it
we
might
be
inclined
to
take
it
up
and
at
least
look
into
it
if
we
could
agree
as
to
terms
he
tried
to
speak
in
cool
careless
way
but
his
eyes
were
shining
with
excitement
and
greed
why
as
to
that
gentlemen
answered
trying
also
to
be
cool
but
feeling
as
excited
as
he
did
there
is
only
one
bargain
which
man
in
my
position
can
make
shall
want
yo
to
help
me
to
my
freedom
and
to
help
my
three
companions
to
theirs
we
shall
then
take
yo
into
partnership
and
give
you
fifth
share
to
divide
between
you
hum
said
he
fifth
share
that
is
not
very
tempting
it
would
come
to
fifty
thousand
apiece
said
but
how
can
we
gain
your
freedom
you
know
very
well
that
you
ask
an
impossibility
nothing
of
the
sort
answered
have
thought
it
all
out
to
the
last
detail
the
only
bar
to
our
escape
is
that
we
can
get
no
boat
fit
for
the
voyage
and
no
provisions
to
last
us
for
so
long
time
there
are
plenty
of
little
yachts
and
yawls
at
calcutta
or
madras
which
would
serve
our
turn
well
do
you
bring
one
over
we
shall
engage
to
get
aboard
her
by
night
and
if
you
will
drop
us
on
any
part
of
the
indian
coast
you
will
have
done
your
part
of
the
bargain
if
there
were
only
one
he
said
none
or
all
answered
we
have
sworn
it
the
four
of
us
must
always
act
together
you
see
morstan
said
he
small
is
man
of
his
word
he
does
not
flinch
from
his
friends
think
we
may
very
well
trust
him
it
dirty
business
the
other
answered
yet
as
you
say
the
money
will
save
our
commissions
handsomely
well
small
said
the
major
we
must
suppose
try
and
meet
you
we
must
first
of
course
test
the
truth
of
your
story
tell
me
where
the
box
is
hid
and
shall
get
leave
of
absence
and
go
back
to
india
in
the
monthly
relief
boat
to
inquire
into
the
affair
not
so
fast
said
growing
colder
as
he
got
hot
must
have
the
consent
of
my
three
comrades
tell
you
that
it
is
four
or
none
with
us
nonsense
he
broke
in
what
have
three
black
fellows
to
do
with
our
agreement
black
or
blue
said
they
are
in
with
me
and
we
all
go
together
well
the
matter
ended
by
second
meeting
at
which
mahomet
singh
abdullah
khan
and
dost
akbar
were
all
present
we
talked
the
matter
over
again
and
at
last
we
came
to
an
arrangement
we
were
to
provide
both
the
officers
with
charts
of
the
part
of
the
agra
fort
and
mark
the
place
in
the
wall
where
the
treasure
was
hid
major
sholto
was
to
go
to
india
to
test
our
story
if
he
found
the
box
he
was
to
leave
it
there
to
send
out
small
yacht
provisioned
for
voyage
which
was
to
lie
off
rutland
island
and
to
which
we
were
to
make
our
way
and
finally
to
return
to
his
duties
captain
morstan
was
then
to
apply
for
leave
of
absence
to
meet
us
at
agra
and
there
we
were
to
have
final
division
of
the
treasure
he
taking
the
major
share
as
well
as
his
own
all
this
we
sealed
by
the
most
solemn
oaths
that
the
mind
could
think
or
the
lips
utter
sat
up
all
night
with
paper
and
ink
and
by
the
morning
had
the
two
charts
all
ready
signed
with
the
sign
of
four
that
is
of
abdullah
akbar
mahomet
and
myself

well
gentlemen
weary
you
with
my
long
story
and
know
that
my
friend
mr
jones
is
impatient
to
get
me
safely
stowed
in
chokey
ll
make
it
as
short
as
can
the
villain
sholto
went
off
to
india
but
he
never
came
back
again
captain
morstan
showed
me
his
name
among
list
of
passengers
in
one
of
the
mail
boats
very
shortly
afterwards
his
uncle
had
died
leaving
him
fortune
and
he
had
left
the
army
yet
he
could
stoop
to
treat
five
men
as
he
had
treated
us
morstan
went
over
to
agra
shortly
afterwards
and
found
as
we
expected
that
the
treasure
was
indeed
gone
the
scoundrel
had
stolen
it
all
without
carrying
out
one
of
the
conditions
on
which
we
had
sold
him
the
secret
from
that
day
lived
only
for
vengeance
thought
of
it
by
day
and
nursed
it
by
night
it
became
an
overpowering
absorbing
passion
with
me
cared
nothing
for
the
law
nothing
for
the
gallows
to
escape
to
track
down
sholto
to
have
my
hand
upon
his
throat
that
was
my
one
thought
even
the
agra
treasure
had
come
to
be
smaller
thing
in
my
mind
than
the
slaying
of
sholto
well
have
set
my
mind
on
many
things
in
this
life
and
never
one
which
did
not
carry
out
but
it
was
weary
years
before
my
time
came
have
told
you
that
had
picked
up
something
of
medicine
one
day
when
dr
somerton
was
down
with
fever
little
andaman
islander
was
picked
up
by
convict
gang
in
the
woods
he
was
sick
to
death
and
had
gone
to
lonely
place
to
die
took
him
in
hand
though
he
was
as
venomous
as
young
snake
and
after
couple
of
months
got
him
all
right
and
able
to
walk
he
took
kind
of
fancy
to
me
then
and
would
hardly
go
back
to
his
woods
but
was
always
hanging
about
my
hut
learned
little
of
his
lingo
from
him
and
this
made
him
all
the
fonder
of
me
tonga
for
that
was
his
name
was
fine
boatman
and
owned
big
roomy
canoe
of
his
own
when
found
that
he
was
devoted
to
me
and
would
do
anything
to
serve
me
saw
my
chance
of
escape
talked
it
over
with
him
he
was
to
bring
his
boat
round
on
certain
night
to
an
old
wharf
which
was
never
guarded
and
there
he
was
to
pick
me
up
gave
him
directions
to
have
several
gourds
of
water
and
lot
of
yams
coconuts
and
sweet
potatoes
he
was
stanch
and
true
was
little
tonga
no
man
ever
had
more
faithful
mate
at
the
night
named
he
had
his
boat
at
the
wharf
as
it
chanced
however
there
was
one
of
the
convict
guard
down
there
vile
pathan
who
had
never
missed
chance
of
insulting
and
injuring
me
had
always
vowed
vengeance
and
now
had
my
chance
it
was
as
if
fate
had
placed
him
in
my
way
that
might
pay
my
debt
before
left
the
island
he
stood
on
the
bank
with
his
back
to
me
and
his
carbine
on
his
shoulder
looked
abut
for
stone
to
beat
out
his
brains
with
but
none
could
see
then
queer
thought
came
into
my
head
and
showed
me
where
could
lay
my
hand
on
weapon
sat
down
in
the
darkness
and
unstrapped
my
wooden
leg
with
three
long
hops
was
on
him
he
put
his
carbine
to
his
shoulder
but
struck
him
full
and
knocked
the
whole
front
of
his
skull
in
you
can
see
the
split
in
the
wood
now
where
hit
him
we
both
went
down
together
for
could
not
keep
my
balance
but
when
got
up
found
him
still
lying
quiet
enough
made
for
the
boat
and
in
an
hour
we
were
well
out
at
sea
tonga
had
brought
all
his
earthly
possessions
with
him
his
arms
and
his
gods
among
other
things
he
had
long
bamboo
spear
and
some
andaman
coconut
matting
with
which
make
sort
of
sail
for
ten
days
we
were
beating
about
trusting
to
luck
and
on
the
eleventh
we
were
picked
up
by
trader
which
was
going
from
singapore
to
jiddah
with
cargo
of
malay
pilgrims
they
were
rum
crowd
and
tonga
and
soon
managed
to
settle
down
among
them
they
had
one
very
good
quality
they
let
you
alone
and
asked
no
questions
well
if
were
to
tell
you
all
the
adventures
that
my
little
chum
and
went
through
you
would
not
thank
me
for
would
have
you
here
until
the
sun
was
shining
here
and
there
we
drifted
about
the
world
something
always
turning
up
to
keep
us
from
london
all
the
time
however
never
lost
sight
of
my
purpose
would
dream
of
sholto
at
night
hundred
times
have
killed
him
in
my
sleep
at
last
however
some
three
or
four
years
ago
we
found
ourselves
in
england
had
no
great
difficulty
in
finding
where
sholto
lived
and
set
to
work
to
discover
whether
he
had
realized
the
treasure
or
if
he
still
had
it
made
friends
with
someone
who
could
help
me
name
no
names
for
don
want
to
get
any
one
else
in
hole
and
soon
found
that
he
still
had
the
jewels
then
tried
to
get
at
him
in
many
ways
but
he
was
pretty
sly
and
had
always
two
prize
fighters
besides
his
sons
and
his
khitmutgar
on
guard
over
him
one
day
however
got
word
that
he
was
dying
hurried
at
once
to
the
garden
mad
that
he
should
slip
out
of
my
clutches
like
that
and
looking
through
the
window
saw
him
lying
in
his
bed
with
his
sons
on
each
side
of
him
have
come
through
and
taken
my
chance
with
the
three
of
them
only
even
as
looked
at
him
his
jaw
dropped
and
knew
that
he
was
gone
got
into
his
room
that
same
night
though
and
searched
his
papers
to
see
if
there
was
any
record
of
where
he
had
hidden
our
jewels
there
was
not
line
however
so
came
away
bitter
and
savage
as
man
could
be
before
left
bethought
me
that
if
ever
met
my
sikh
friends
again
it
would
be
satisfaction
to
know
that
had
left
some
mark
of
our
hatred
so
scrawled
down
the
sign
of
the
four
of
us
as
it
had
been
on
the
chart
and
pinned
it
on
his
bosom
it
was
too
much
that
he
should
be
taken
to
the
grave
without
some
token
from
the
men
whom
he
had
robbed
and
befooled
we
earned
living
at
this
time
by
my
exhibiting
poor
tonga
at
fairs
and
other
such
places
as
the
black
cannibal
he
would
eat
raw
meat
and
dance
his
war
dance
so
we
always
had
hatful
of
pennies
after
day
work
still
heard
all
the
news
from
pondicherry
lodge
and
for
some
years
there
was
no
news
to
hear
except
that
they
were
hunting
for
the
treasure
at
last
however
came
what
we
had
waited
for
so
long
the
treasure
had
been
found
it
was
up
at
the
top
of
the
house
in
mr
bartholomew
sholto
chemical
laboratory
came
at
once
and
had
look
at
the
place
but
could
not
see
how
with
my
wooden
leg
was
to
make
my
way
up
to
it
learned
however
about
trap
door
in
the
roof
and
also
about
mr
sholto
supper
hour
it
seemed
to
me
that
could
manage
the
thing
easily
through
tonga
brought
him
out
with
me
with
long
rope
wound
round
his
waist
he
could
climb
like
cat
and
he
soon
made
his
way
through
the
roof
but
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
bartholomew
sholto
was
still
in
the
room
to
his
cost
tonga
thought
he
had
done
something
very
clever
in
killing
him
for
when
came
up
by
the
rope
found
him
strutting
about
as
proud
as
peacock
very
much
surprised
was
he
when
made
at
him
with
the
rope
end
and
cursed
him
for
little
blood
thirsty
imp
took
the
treasurebox
and
let
it
down
and
then
slid
down
myself
having
first
left
the
sign
of
the
four
upon
the
table
to
show
that
the
jewels
had
come
back
at
last
to
those
who
had
most
right
to
them
tonga
then
pulled
up
the
rope
closed
the
window
and
made
off
the
way
that
he
had
come
don
know
that
have
anything
else
to
tell
you
had
heard
waterman
speak
of
the
speed
of
smith
launch
the
aurora
so
thought
she
would
be
handy
craft
for
our
escape
engaged
with
old
smith
and
was
to
give
him
big
sum
if
he
got
us
safe
to
our
ship
he
knew
no
doubt
that
there
was
some
screw
loose
but
he
was
not
in
our
secrets
all
this
is
the
truth
and
if
tell
it
to
you
gentlemen
it
is
not
to
amuse
you
for
you
have
not
done
me
very
good
turn
but
it
is
because
believe
the
best
defence
can
make
is
just
to
hold
back
nothing
but
let
all
the
wold
know
how
badly
have
myself
been
served
by
major
sholto
and
how
innocent
am
of
the
death
of
his
son
very
remarkable
account
said
sherlock
holmes
fitting
wind
up
to
an
extremely
interesting
case
there
is
nothing
at
all
new
to
me
in
the
latter
part
of
your
narrative
except
that
you
brought
your
own
rope
that
did
not
know
by
the
way
had
hoped
that
tonga
had
lost
all
his
darts
yet
he
managed
to
shoot
one
at
us
in
the
boat
he
had
lost
them
all
sir
except
the
one
which
was
in
his
blow
pipe
at
the
time
ah
of
course
said
holmes
had
not
thought
of
that
is
there
any
other
point
which
you
would
like
to
ask
about
asked
the
convict
affably
think
not
thank
you
my
companion
answered
well
holmes
said
athelney
jones
you
are
man
to
be
humoured
and
we
all
know
that
you
are
connoisseur
of
crime
but
duty
is
duty
and
have
gone
rather
far
in
doing
what
you
and
your
friend
asked
me
shall
feel
more
at
ease
when
we
have
our
story
teller
here
safe
under
lock
and
key
the
cab
still
waits
and
there
are
two
inspectors
downstairs
am
much
obliged
to
you
both
for
your
assistance
of
course
you
will
be
wanted
at
the
trial
good

good
night
gentlemen
both
said
jonathan
small
you
first
small
remarked
the
wary
jones
as
they
left
the
room
ll
take
particular
care
that
you
don
club
me
with
your
wooden
leg
whatever
you
may
have
done
to
the
gentleman
at
the
andaman
isles
well
and
there
is
the
end
of
our
little
drama
remarked
after
we
had
set
some
time
smoking
in
silence
fear
that
it
may
be
the
last
investigation
in
which
shall
have
the
chance
of
studying
your
methods
miss
morstan
has
done
me
the
honour
to
accept
me
as
husband
in
prospective
he
gave
most
dismal
groan
feared
as
much
said
he
really
cannot
congratulate
you
was
little
hurt
have
you
any
reason
to
be
dissatisfied
with
my
choice
asked
not
at
all
think
she
is
one
of
the
most
charming
young
ladies
ever
met
and
might
have
been
most
useful
in
such
work
as
we
have
been
doing
she
had
decided
genius
that
way
witness
the
way
in
which
she
preserved
that
agra
plan
from
all
the
other
papers
of
her
father
but
love
is
an
emotional
thing
and
whatever
is
emotional
is
opposed
to
that
true
cold
reason
which
place
above
all
things
should
never
marry
myself
lest
bias
my
judgment
trust
said
laughing
that
my
judgment
may
survive
the
ordeal
but
you
look
weary
yes
the
reaction
is
already
upon
me
shall
be
as
limp
as
rag
for
week
strange
said
how
terms
of
what
in
another
man
should
call
laziness
alternate
with
your
fits
of
splendid
energy
and
vigour
yes
he
answered
there
are
in
me
the
makings
of
very
fine
loafer
and
also
of
pretty
spry
sort
of
fellow
often
think
of
those
lines
of
old
goethe
schade
dass
die
natur
nureinen
mensch
aus
dir
schuf
denn
zum
würdigen
mann
war
und
zum
schelmen
der
stoff
by
the
way
apropos
of
this
norwood
business
you
see
that
they
had
as
surmised
confederate
in
the
house
who
could
be
none
other
than
lal
rao
the
butler
so
jones
actually
has
the
undivided
honour
of
having
caught
one
fish
in
his
great
haul
the
division
seems
rather
unfair
remarked
you
have
done
all
the
work
in
this
business
get
wife
out
of
it
jones
gets
the
credit
pray
what
remains
for
you
for
me
said
sherlock
holmes
there
still
remains
the
cocaine
bottle
and
he
stretched
his
long
white
hand
up
for
it

mr

who
was
usually
very
late
in
the
mornings
save
upon
those
not
infrequent
occasions
when
he
was
up
all
night
was
seated
at
the
breakfast
table
stood
upon
the
hearth
rug
and
picked
up
the
stick
which
our
visitor
had
left
behind
him
the
night
before
it
was
fine
thick
piece
of
wood
bulbous
headed
of
the
sort
which
is
known
as
penang
lawyer
just
under
the
head
was
broad
silver
band
nearly
an
inch
across
to
james
mortimer
from
his
friends
of
the
was
engraved
upon
it
with
the
date
1884
it
was
just
such
stick
as
the
old
fashioned
family
practitioner
used
to
carry
dignified
solid
and
reassuring
well
watson
what
do
you
make
of
it
holmes
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
me
and
had
given
him
no
sign
of
my
occupation
how
did
you
know
what
was
doing
believe
you
have
eyes
in
the
back
of
your
head
have
at
least
well
polished
silver
plated
coffee
pot
in
front
of
me
said
he
but
tell
me
watson
what
do
you
make
of
our
visitor
stick
since
we
have
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
miss
him
and
have
no
notion
of
his
errand
this
accidental
souvenir
becomes
of
importance
let
me
hear
you
reconstruct
the
man
by
an
examination
of
it
think
said
following
as
far
as
could
the
methods
of
my
companion
that
dr
mortimer
is
successful
elderly
medical
man
well
esteemed
since
those
who
know
him
give
him
this
mark
of
their
appreciation
good
said
holmes
excellent
think
also
that
the
probability
is
in
favour
of
his
being
country
practitioner
who
does
great
deal
of
his
visiting
on
foot
why
so
because
this
stick
though
originally
very
handsome
one
has
been
so
knocked
about
that
can
hardly
imagine
town
practitioner
carrying
it
the
thick
iron
ferrule
is
worn
down
so
it
is
evident
that
he
has
done
great
amount
of
walking
with
it
perfectly
sound
said
holmes
and
then
again
there
is
the
friends
of
the
should
guess
that
to
be
the
something
hunt
the
local
hunt
to
whose
members
he
has
possibly
given
some
surgical
assistance
and
which
has
made
him
small
presentation
in
return
really
watson
you
excel
yourself
said
holmes
pushing
back
his
chair
and
lighting
cigarette
am
bound
to
say
that
in
all
the
accounts
which
you
have
been
so
good
as
to
give
of
my
own
small
achievements
you
have
habitually
underrated
your
own
abilities
it
may
be
that
you
are
not
yourself
luminous
but
you
are
conductor
of
light
some
people
without
possessing
genius
have
remarkable
power
of
stimulating
it
confess
my
dear
fellow
that
am
very
much
in
your
debt
he
had
never
said
as
much
before
and
must
admit
that
his
words
gave
me
keen
pleasure
for
had
often
been
piqued
by
his
indifference
to
my
admiration
and
to
the
attempts
which
had
made
to
give
publicity
to
his
methods
was
proud
too
to
think
that
had
so
far
mastered
his
system
as
to
apply
it
in
way
which
earned
his
approval
he
now
took
the
stick
from
my
hands
and
examined
it
for
few
minutes
with
his
naked
eyes
then
with
an
expression
of
interest
he
laid
down
his
cigarette
and
carrying
the
cane
to
the
window
he
looked
over
it
again
with
convex
lens
interesting
though
elementary
said
he
as
he
returned
to
his
favourite
corner
of
the
settee
there
are
certainly
one
or
two
indications
upon
the
stick
it
gives
us
the
basis
for
several
deductions
has
anything
escaped
me
asked
with
some
self
importance
trust
that
there
is
nothing
of
consequence
which
have
overlooked
am
afraid
my
dear
watson
that
most
of
your
conclusions
were
erroneous
when
said
that
you
stimulated
me
meant
to
be
frank
that
in
noting
your
fallacies
was
occasionally
guided
towards
the
truth
not
that
you
are
entirely
wrong
in
this
instance
the
man
is
certainly
country
practitioner
and
he
walks
good
deal
then
was
right
to
that
extent
but
that
was
all
no
my
dear
watson
not
all
by
no
means
all
would
suggest
for
example
that
presentation
to
doctor
is
more
likely
to
come
from
hospital
than
from
hunt
and
that
when
the
initials
are
placed
before
that
hospital
the
words
charing
cross
very
naturally
suggest
themselves
you
may
be
right
the
probability
lies
in
that
direction
and
if
we
take
this
as
working
hypothesis
we
have
fresh
basis
from
which
to
start
our
construction
of
this
unknown
visitor
well
then
supposing
that
does
stand
for
charing
cross
hospital
what
further
inferences
may
we
draw
do
none
suggest
themselves
you
know
my
methods
apply
them
can
only
think
of
the
obvious
conclusion
that
the
man
has
practised
in
town
before
going
to
the
country
think
that
we
might
venture
little
farther
than
this
look
at
it
in
this
light
on
what
occasion
would
it
be
most
probable
that
such
presentation
would
be
made
when
would
his
friends
unite
to
give
him
pledge
of
their
good
will
obviously
at
the
moment
when
dr
mortimer
withdrew
from
the
service
of
the
hospital
in
order
to
start
in
practice
for
himself
we
know
there
has
been
presentation
we
believe
there
has
been
change
from
town
hospital
to
country
practice
is
it
then
stretching
our
inference
too
far
to
say
that
the
presentation
was
on
the
occasion
of
the
change
it
certainly
seems
probable
now
you
will
observe
that
he
could
not
have
been
on
the
staff
of
the
hospital
since
only
man
well
established
in
london
practice
could
hold
such
position
and
such
one
would
not
drift
into
the
country
what
was
he
then
if
he
was
in
the
hospital
and
yet
not
on
the
staff
he
could
only
have
been
house
surgeon
or
house
physician
little
more
than
senior
student
and
he
left
five
years
ago
the
date
is
on
the
stick
so
your
grave
middle
aged
family
practitioner
vanishes
into
thin
air
my
dear
watson
and
there
emerges
young
fellow
under
thirty
amiable
unambitious
absent
minded
and
the
possessor
of
favourite
dog
which
should
describe
roughly
as
being
larger
than
terrier
and
smaller
than
mastiff
laughed
incredulously
as
sherlock
holmes
leaned
back
in
his
settee
and
blew
little
wavering
rings
of
smoke
up
to
the
ceiling
as
to
the
latter
part
have
no
means
of
checking
you
said
but
at
least
it
is
not
difficult
to
find
out
few
particulars
about
the
man
age
and
professional
career
from
my
small
medical
shelf
took
down
the
medical
directory
and
turned
up
the
name
there
were
several
mortimers
but
only
one
who
could
be
our
visitor
read
his
record
aloud

watson

with

country

as
you
very
astutely
observed
think
that
am
fairly
justified
in
my
inferences
as
to
the
adjectives
said
if
remember
right
amiable
unambitious
and
absent

it
is
my
experience
that
it
is
only
an
amiable
man
in
this
world
who
receives
testimonials
only
an
unambitious
one
who
abandons
london
career
for
the
country
and
only
an
absent
minded
one
who
leaves
his
stick
and
not
his
visiting
card
after
waiting
an
hour
in
your
room
and
the
dog
has
been
in
the
habit
of
carrying
this
stick
behind
his
master
being
heavy
stick
the
dog
has
held
it
tightly
by
the
middle
and
the
marks
of
his
teeth
are
very
plainly
visible
the
dog
jaw
as
shown
in
the
space
between
these
marks
is
too
broad
in
my
opinion
for
terrier
and
not
broad
enough
for
mastiff
it
may
have
been
yes
by
jove
it
is
curly
haired
spaniel
he
had
risen
and
paced
the
room
as
he
spoke
now
he
halted
in
the
recess
of
the
window
there
was
such
ring
of
conviction
in
his
voice
that
glanced
up
in
surprise
my
dear
fellow
how
can
you
possibly
be
so
sure
of
that
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
see
the
dog
himself
on
our
very
doorstep
and
there
is
the
ring
of
its
owner
don
move
beg
you
watson
he
is
professional
brother
of
yours
and
your
presence
may
be
of
assistance
to
me
now
is
the
dramatic
moment
of
fate
watson
when
you
hear
step
upon
the
stair
which
is
walking
into
your
life
and
you
know
not
whether
for
good
or
ill
what
does
dr
james
mortimer
the
man
of
science
ask
of
sherlock
holmes
the
specialist
in
crime
come
in
the
appearance
of
our
visitor
was
surprise
to
me
since
had
expected
typical
country
practitioner
he
was
very
tall
thin
man
with
long
nose
like
beak
which
jutted
out
between
two
keen
grey
eyes
set
closely
together
and
sparkling
brightly
from
behind
pair
of
gold
rimmed
glasses
he
was
clad
in
professional
but
rather
slovenly
fashion
for
his
frock
coat
was
dingy
and
his
trousers
frayed
though
young
his
long
back
was
already
bowed
and
he
walked
with
forward
thrust
of
his
head
and
general
air
of
peering
benevolence
as
he
entered
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
stick
in
holmes
hand
and
he
ran
towards
it
with
an
exclamation
of
joy
am
so
very
glad
said
he
was
not
sure
whether
had
left
it
here
or
in
the
shipping
office
would
not
lose
that
stick
for
the
world
presentation
see
said
holmes
yes
sir
from
charing
cross
hospital
from
one
or
two
friends
there
on
the
occasion
of
my
marriage
dear
that
bad
said
holmes
shaking
his
head
dr
mortimer
blinked
through
his
glasses
in
mild
astonishment
why
was
it
bad
only
that
you
have
disarranged
our
little
deductions
your
marriage
you
say
yes
sir
married
and
so
left
the
hospital
and
with
it
all
hopes
of
consulting
practice
it
was
necessary
to
make
home
of
my
own
come
we
are
not
so
far
wrong
after
all
said
holmes
and
now
dr
james
mortimer—
mister
sir
mister
humble
and
man
of
precise
mind
evidently
dabbler
in
science
mr
holmes
picker
up
of
shells
on
the
shores
of
the
great
unknown
ocean
presume
that
it
is
mr
sherlock
holmes
whom
am
addressing
and
not—
no
this
is
my
friend
dr
watson
glad
to
meet
you
sir
have
heard
your
name
mentioned
in
connection
with
that
of
your
friend
you
interest
me
very
much
mr
holmes
had
hardly
expected
so
dolichocephalic
skull
or
such
well
marked
supra
orbital
development
would
you
have
any
objection
to
my
running
my
finger
along
your
parietal
fissure
cast
of
your
skull
sir
until
the
original
is
available
would
be
an
ornament
to
any
anthropological
museum
it
is
not
my
intention
to
be
fulsome
but
confess
that
covet
your
skull
sherlock
holmes
waved
our
strange
visitor
into
chair
you
are
an
enthusiast
in
your
line
of
thought
perceive
sir
as
am
in
mine
said
he
observe
from
your
forefinger
that
you
make
your
own
cigarettes
have
no
hesitation
in
lighting
one
the
man
drew
out
paper
and
tobacco
and
twirled
the
one
up
in
the
other
with
surprising
dexterity
he
had
long
quivering
fingers
as
agile
and
restless
as
the
antennae
of
an
insect
holmes
was
silent
but
his
little
darting
glances
showed
me
the
interest
which
he
took
in
our
curious
companion
presume
sir
said
he
at
last
that
it
was
not
merely
for
the
purpose
of
examining
my
skull
that
you
have
done
me
the
honour
to
call
here
last
night
and
again
to
day
no
sir
no
though
am
happy
to
have
had
the
opportunity
of
doing
that
as
well
came
to
you
mr
holmes
because
recognized
that
am
myself
an
unpractical
man
and
because
am
suddenly
confronted
with
most
serious
and
extraordinary
problem
recognizing
as
do
that
you
are
the
second
highest
expert
in
europe—
indeed
sir
may
inquire
who
has
the
honour
to
be
the
first
asked
holmes
with
some
asperity
to
the
man
of
precisely
scientific
mind
the
work
of
monsieur
bertillon
must
always
appeal
strongly
then
had
you
not
better
consult
him
said
sir
to
the
precisely
scientific
mind
but
as
practical
man
of
affairs
it
is
acknowledged
that
you
stand
alone
trust
sir
that
have
not
inadvertently—
just
little
said
holmes
think
dr
mortimer
you
would
do
wisely
if
without
more
ado
you
would
kindly
tell
me
plainly
what
the
exact
nature
of
the
problem
is
in
which
you
demand
my
assistance
ii
the
curse
of
the
baskervilles
have
in
my
pocket
manuscript
said
dr
james
mortimer
observed
it
as
you
entered
the
room
said
holmes
it
is
an
old
manuscript
early
eighteenth
century
unless
it
is
forgery
how
can
you
say
that
sir
you
have
presented
an
inch
or
two
of
it
to
my
examination
all
the
time
that
you
have
been
talking
it
would
be
poor
expert
who
could
not
give
the
date
of
document
within
decade
or
so
you
may
possibly
have
read
my
little
monograph
upon
the
subject
put
that
at
1730
the
exact
date
is
1742
dr
mortimer
drew
it
from
his
breast
pocket
this
family
paper
was
committed
to
my
care
by
sir
charles
baskerville
whose
sudden
and
tragic
death
some
three
months
ago
created
so
much
excitement
in
devonshire
may
say
that
was
his
personal
friend
as
well
as
his
medical
attendant
he
was
strong
minded
man
sir
shrewd
practical
and
as
unimaginative
as
am
myself
yet
he
took
this
document
very
seriously
and
his
mind
was
prepared
for
just
such
an
end
as
did
eventually
overtake
him
holmes
stretched
out
his
hand
for
the
manuscript
and
flattened
it
upon
his
knee
you
will
observe
watson
the
alternative
use
of
the
long
and
the
short
it
is
one
of
several
indications
which
enabled
me
to
fix
the
date
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
yellow
paper
and
the
faded
script
at
the
head
was
written
baskerville
hall
and
below
in
large
scrawling
figures
1742
it
appears
to
be
statement
of
some
sort
yes
it
is
statement
of
certain
legend
which
runs
in
the
baskerville
family
but
understand
that
it
is
something
more
modern
and
practical
upon
which
you
wish
to
consult
me
most
modern
most
practical
pressing
matter
which
must
be
decided
within
twenty
four
hours
but
the
manuscript
is
short
and
is
intimately
connected
with
the
affair
with
your
permission
will
read
it
to
you
holmes
leaned
back
in
his
chair
placed
his
finger
tips
together
and
closed
his
eyes
with
an
air
of
resignation
dr
mortimer
turned
the
manuscript
to
the
light
and
read
in
high
cracking
voice
the
following
curious
old
world
narrative
of
the
origin
of
the
hound
of
the
baskervilles
there
have
been
many
statements
yet
as
come
in
direct
line
from
hugo
baskerville
and
as
had
the
story
from
my
father
who
also
had
it
from
his
have
set
it
down
with
all
belief
that
it
occurred
even
as
is
here
set
forth
and
would
have
you
believe
my
sons
that
the
same
justice
which
punishes
sin
may
also
most
graciously
forgive
it
and
that
no
ban
is
so
heavy
but
that
by
prayer
and
repentance
it
may
be
removed
learn
then
from
this
story
not
to
fear
the
fruits
of
the
past
but
rather
to
be
circumspect
in
the
future
that
those
foul
passions
whereby
our
family
has
suffered
so
grievously
may
not
again
be
loosed
to
our
undoing

know
then
that
in
the
time
of
the
great
rebellion
the
history
of
which
by
the
learned
lord
clarendon
most
earnestly
commend
to
your
attention
this
manor
of
baskerville
was
held
by
hugo
of
that
name
nor
can
it
be
gainsaid
that
he
was
most
wild
profane
and
godless
man
this
in
truth
his
neighbours
might
have
pardoned
seeing
that
saints
have
never
flourished
in
those
parts
but
there
was
in
him
certain
wanton
and
cruel
humour
which
made
his
name
by
word
through
the
west
it
chanced
that
this
hugo
came
to
love
if
indeed
so
dark
passion
may
be
known
under
so
bright
name
the
daughter
of
yeoman
who
held
lands
near
the
baskerville
estate
but
the
young
maiden
being
discreet
and
of
good
repute
would
ever
avoid
him
for
she
feared
his
evil
name
so
it
came
to
pass
that
one
michaelmas
this
hugo
with
five
or
six
of
his
idle
and
wicked
companions
stole
down
upon
the
farm
and
carried
off
the
maiden
her
father
and
brothers
being
from
home
as
he
well
knew
when
they
had
brought
her
to
the
hall
the
maiden
was
placed
in
an
upper
chamber
while
hugo
and
his
friends
sat
down
to
long
carouse
as
was
their
nightly
custom
now
the
poor
lass
upstairs
was
like
to
have
her
wits
turned
at
the
singing
and
shouting
and
terrible
oaths
which
came
up
to
her
from
below
for
they
say
that
the
words
used
by
hugo
baskerville
when
he
was
in
wine
were
such
as
might
blast
the
man
who
said
them
at
last
in
the
stress
of
her
fear
she
did
that
which
might
have
daunted
the
bravest
or
most
active
man
for
by
the
aid
of
the
growth
of
ivy
which
covered
and
still
covers
the
south
wall
she
came
down
from
under
the
eaves
and
so
homeward
across
the
moor
there
being
three
leagues
betwixt
the
hall
and
her
father
farm
it
chanced
that
some
little
time
later
hugo
left
his
guests
to
carry
food
and
drink
with
other
worse
things
perchance
to
his
captive
and
so
found
the
cage
empty
and
the
bird
escaped
then
as
it
would
seem
he
became
as
one
that
hath
devil
for
rushing
down
the
stairs
into
the
dining
hall
he
sprang
upon
the
great
table
flagons
and
trenchers
flying
before
him
and
he
cried
aloud
before
all
the
company
that
he
would
that
very
night
render
his
body
and
soul
to
the
powers
of
evil
if
he
might
but
overtake
the
wench
and
while
the
revellers
stood
aghast
at
the
fury
of
the
man
one
more
wicked
or
it
may
be
more
drunken
than
the
rest
cried
out
that
they
should
put
the
hounds
upon
her
whereat
hugo
ran
from
the
house
crying
to
his
grooms
that
they
should
saddle
his
mare
and
unkennel
the
pack
and
giving
the
hounds
kerchief
of
the
maid
he
swung
them
to
the
line
and
so
off
full
cry
in
the
moonlight
over
the
moor
now
for
some
space
the
revellers
stood
agape
unable
to
understand
all
that
had
been
done
in
such
haste
but
anon
their
bemused
wits
awoke
to
the
nature
of
the
deed
which
was
like
to
be
done
upon
the
moorlands
everything
was
now
in
an
uproar
some
calling
for
their
pistols
some
for
their
horses
and
some
for
another
flask
of
wine
but
at
length
some
sense
came
back
to
their
crazed
minds
and
the
whole
of
them
thirteen
in
number
took
horse
and
started
in
pursuit
the
moon
shone
clear
above
them
and
they
rode
swiftly
abreast
taking
that
course
which
the
maid
must
needs
have
taken
if
she
were
to
reach
her
own
home
they
had
gone
mile
or
two
when
they
passed
one
of
the
night
shepherds
upon
the
moorlands
and
they
cried
to
him
to
know
if
he
had
seen
the
hunt
and
the
man
as
the
story
goes
was
so
crazed
with
fear
that
he
could
scarce
speak
but
at
last
he
said
that
he
had
indeed
seen
the
unhappy
maiden
with
the
hounds
upon
her
track
but
have
seen
more
than
that
said
he
for
hugo
baskerville
passed
me
upon
his
black
mare
and
there
ran
mute
behind
him
such
hound
of
hell
as
god
forbid
should
ever
be
at
my
heels
so
the
drunken
squires
cursed
the
shepherd
and
rode
onward
but
soon
their
skins
turned
cold
for
there
came
galloping
across
the
moor
and
the
black
mare
dabbled
with
white
froth
went
past
with
trailing
bridle
and
empty
saddle
then
the
revellers
rode
close
together
for
great
fear
was
on
them
but
they
still
followed
over
the
moor
though
each
had
he
been
alone
would
have
been
right
glad
to
have
turned
his
horse
head
riding
slowly
in
this
fashion
they
came
at
last
upon
the
hounds
these
though
known
for
their
valour
and
their
breed
were
whimpering
in
cluster
at
the
head
of
deep
dip
or
goyal
as
we
call
it
upon
the
moor
some
slinking
away
and
some
with
starting
hackles
and
staring
eyes
gazing
down
the
narrow
valley
before
them
the
company
had
come
to
halt
more
sober
men
as
you
may
guess
than
when
they
started
the
most
of
them
would
by
no
means
advance
but
three
of
them
the
boldest
or
it
may
be
the
most
drunken
rode
forward
down
the
goyal
now
it
opened
into
broad
space
in
which
stood
two
of
those
great
stones
still
to
be
seen
there
which
were
set
by
certain
forgotten
peoples
in
the
days
of
old
the
moon
was
shining
bright
upon
the
clearing
and
there
in
the
centre
lay
the
unhappy
maid
where
she
had
fallen
dead
of
fear
and
of
fatigue
but
it
was
not
the
sight
of
her
body
nor
yet
was
it
that
of
the
body
of
hugo
baskerville
lying
near
her
which
raised
the
hair
upon
the
heads
of
these
three
daredevil
roysterers
but
it
was
that
standing
over
hugo
and
plucking
at
his
throat
there
stood
foul
thing
great
black
beast
shaped
like
hound
yet
larger
than
any
hound
that
ever
mortal
eye
has
rested
upon
and
even
as
they
looked
the
thing
tore
the
throat
out
of
hugo
baskerville
on
which
as
it
turned
its
blazing
eyes
and
dripping
jaws
upon
them
the
three
shrieked
with
fear
and
rode
for
dear
life
still
screaming
across
the
moor
one
it
is
said
died
that
very
night
of
what
he
had
seen
and
the
other
twain
were
but
broken
men
for
the
rest
of
their
days
such
is
the
tale
my
sons
of
the
coming
of
the
hound
which
is
said
to
have
plagued
the
family
so
sorely
ever
since
if
have
set
it
down
it
is
because
that
which
is
clearly
known
hath
less
terror
than
that
which
is
but
hinted
at
and
guessed
nor
can
it
be
denied
that
many
of
the
family
have
been
unhappy
in
their
deaths
which
have
been
sudden
bloody
and
mysterious
yet
may
we
shelter
ourselves
in
the
infinite
goodness
of
providence
which
would
not
forever
punish
the
innocent
beyond
that
third
or
fourth
generation
which
is
threatened
in
holy
writ
to
that
providence
my
sons
hereby
commend
you
and
counsel
you
by
way
of
caution
to
forbear
from
crossing
the
moor
in
those
dark
hours
when
the
powers
of
evil
are
exalted
this
from
hugo
baskerville
to
his
sons
rodger
and
john
with
instructions
that
they
say
nothing
thereof
to
their
sister
elizabeth
when
dr
mortimer
had
finished
reading
this
singular
narrative
he
pushed
his
spectacles
up
on
his
forehead
and
stared
across
at
mr
sherlock
holmes
the
latter
yawned
and
tossed
the
end
of
his
cigarette
into
the
fire
well
said
he
do
you
not
find
it
interesting
to
collector
of
fairy
tales
dr
mortimer
drew
folded
newspaper
out
of
his
pocket
now
mr
holmes
we
will
give
you
something
little
more
recent
this
is
the
devon
county
chronicle
of
june
14th
of
this
year
it
is
short
account
of
the
facts
elicited
at
the
death
of
sir
charles
baskerville
which
occurred
few
days
before
that
date
my
friend
leaned
little
forward
and
his
expression
became
intent
our
visitor
readjusted
his
glasses
and
began
the
recent
sudden
death
of
sir
charles
baskerville
whose
name
has
been
mentioned
as
the
probable
liberal
candidate
for
mid
devon
at
the
next
election
has
cast
gloom
over
the
county
though
sir
charles
had
resided
at
baskerville
hall
for
comparatively
short
period
his
amiability
of
character
and
extreme
generosity
had
won
the
affection
and
respect
of
all
who
had
been
brought
into
contact
with
him
in
these
days
of
nouveaux
riches
it
is
refreshing
to
find
case
where
the
scion
of
an
old
county
family
which
has
fallen
upon
evil
days
is
able
to
make
his
own
fortune
and
to
bring
it
back
with
him
to
restore
the
fallen
grandeur
of
his
line
sir
charles
as
is
well
known
made
large
sums
of
money
in
south
african
speculation
more
wise
than
those
who
go
on
until
the
wheel
turns
against
them
he
realized
his
gains
and
returned
to
england
with
them
it
is
only
two
years
since
he
took
up
his
residence
at
baskerville
hall
and
it
is
common
talk
how
large
were
those
schemes
of
reconstruction
and
improvement
which
have
been
interrupted
by
his
death
being
himself
childless
it
was
his
openly
expressed
desire
that
the
whole
countryside
should
within
his
own
lifetime
profit
by
his
good
fortune
and
many
will
have
personal
reasons
for
bewailing
his
untimely
end
his
generous
donations
to
local
and
county
charities
have
been
frequently
chronicled
in
these
columns
the
circumstances
connected
with
the
death
of
sir
charles
cannot
be
said
to
have
been
entirely
cleared
up
by
the
inquest
but
at
least
enough
has
been
done
to
dispose
of
those
rumours
to
which
local
superstition
has
given
rise
there
is
no
reason
whatever
to
suspect
foul
play
or
to
imagine
that
death
could
be
from
any
but
natural
causes
sir
charles
was
widower
and
man
who
may
be
said
to
have
been
in
some
ways
of
an
eccentric
habit
of
mind
in
spite
of
his
considerable
wealth
he
was
simple
in
his
personal
tastes
and
his
indoor
servants
at
baskerville
hall
consisted
of
married
couple
named
barrymore
the
husband
acting
as
butler
and
the
wife
as
housekeeper
their
evidence
corroborated
by
that
of
several
friends
tends
to
show
that
sir
charles
health
has
for
some
time
been
impaired
and
points
especially
to
some
affection
of
the
heart
manifesting
itself
in
changes
of
colour
breathlessness
and
acute
attacks
of
nervous
depression
dr
james
mortimer
the
friend
and
medical
attendant
of
the
deceased
has
given
evidence
to
the
same
effect

the
facts
of
the
case
are
simple
sir
charles
baskerville
was
in
the
habit
every
night
before
going
to
bed
of
walking
down
the
famous
yew
alley
of
baskerville
hall
the
evidence
of
the
barrymores
shows
that
this
had
been
his
custom
on
the
4th
of
june
sir
charles
had
declared
his
intention
of
starting
next
day
for
london
and
had
ordered
barrymore
to
prepare
his
luggage
that
night
he
went
out
as
usual
for
his
nocturnal
walk
in
the
course
of
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
smoking
cigar
he
never
returned
at
twelve
clock
barrymore
finding
the
hall
door
still
open
became
alarmed
and
lighting
lantern
went
in
search
of
his
master
the
day
had
been
wet
and
sir
charles
footmarks
were
easily
traced
down
the
alley
half
way
down
this
walk
there
is
gate
which
leads
out
on
to
the
moor
there
were
indications
that
sir
charles
had
stood
for
some
little
time
here
he
then
proceeded
down
the
alley
and
it
was
at
the
far
end
of
it
that
his
body
was
discovered
one
fact
which
has
not
been
explained
is
the
statement
of
barrymore
that
his
master
footprints
altered
their
character
from
the
time
that
he
passed
the
moor
gate
and
that
he
appeared
from
thence
onward
to
have
been
walking
upon
his
toes
one
murphy
gipsy
horse
dealer
was
on
the
moor
at
no
great
distance
at
the
time
but
he
appears
by
his
own
confession
to
have
been
the
worse
for
drink
he
declares
that
he
heard
cries
but
is
unable
to
state
from
what
directionthey
came
no
signs
of
violence
were
to
be
discovered
upon
sir
charles
person
and
though
the
doctor
evidence
pointed
to
an
almost
incredible
facial
distortion
so
great
that
dr
mortimer
refused
at
first
to
believe
that
it
was
indeed
his
friend
and
patient
who
lay
before
him
it
was
explained
that
is
symptom
which
is
not
unusual
in
cases
of
dyspnoea
and
death
from
cardiac
exhaustion
this
explanation
was
borne
out
by
the
post
mortem
examination
which
showed
long
standing
organic
disease
and
the
coroner
jury
returned
verdict
in
accordance
with
the
medical
evidence
it
is
well
that
this
is
so
for
it
is
obviously
of
the
utmost
importance
that
sir
charles
heir
should
settle
at
the
hall
and
continue
the
good
work
which
has
been
so
sadly
interrupted
had
the
prosaic
finding
of
the
coroner
not
finally
put
an
end
to
the
romantic
stories
which
have
been
whispered
in
connection
with
the
affair
it
might
have
been
difficult
to
find
tenant
for
baskerville
hall
it
is
understood
that
the
next
of
kin
is
mr
henry
baskerville
if
he
be
still
alive
the
son
of
sir
charles
baskerville
younger
brother
the
young
man
when
last
heard
of
was
in
america
and
inquiries
are
being
instituted
with
view
to
informing
him
of
his
good
fortune
dr
mortimer
refolded
his
paper
and
replaced
it
in
his
pocket
those
are
the
public
facts
mr
holmes
in
connection
with
the
death
of
sir
charles
baskerville
must
thank
you
said
sherlock
holmes
for
calling
my
attention
to
case
which
certainly
presents
some
features
of
interest
had
observed
some
newspaper
comment
at
the
time
but
was
exceedingly
preoccupied
by
that
little
affair
of
the
vatican
cameos
and
in
my
anxiety
to
oblige
the
pope
lost
touch
with
several
interesting
english
cases
this
article
you
say
contains
all
the
public
facts
it
does
then
let
me
have
the
private
ones
he
leaned
back
put
his
finger
tips
together
and
assumed
his
most
impassive
and
judicial
expression
in
doing
so
said
dr
mortimer
who
had
begun
to
show
signs
of
some
strong
emotion
am
telling
that
which
have
not
confided
to
anyone
my
motive
for
withholding
it
from
the
coroner
inquiry
is
that
man
of
science
shrinks
from
placing
himself
in
the
public
position
of
seeming
to
indorse
popular
superstition
had
the
further
motive
that
baskerville
hall
as
the
paper
says
would
certainly
remain
untenanted
if
anything
were
done
to
increase
its
already
rather
grim
reputation
for
both
these
reasons
thought
that
was
justified
in
telling
rather
less
than
knew
since
no
practical
good
could
result
from
it
but
with
you
there
is
no
reason
why
should
not
be
perfectly
frank
the
moor
is
very
sparsely
inhabited
and
those
who
live
near
each
other
are
thrown
very
much
together
for
this
reason
saw
good
deal
of
sir
charles
baskerville
with
the
exception
of
mr
frankland
of
lafter
hall
and
mr
stapleton
the
naturalist
there
are
no
other
men
of
education
within
many
miles
sir
charles
was
retiring
man
but
the
chance
of
his
illness
brought
us
together
and
community
of
interests
in
science
kept
us
so
he
had
brought
back
much
scientific
information
from
south
africa
and
many
charming
evening
we
have
spent
together
discussing
the
comparative
anatomy
of
the
bushman
and
the
hottentot
within
the
last
few
months
it
became
increasingly
plain
to
me
that
sir
charles
nervous
system
was
strained
to
the
breaking
point
he
had
taken
this
legend
which
have
read
you
exceedingly
to
heart
so
much
so
that
although
he
would
walk
in
his
own
grounds
nothing
would
induce
him
to
go
out
upon
the
moor
at
night
incredible
as
it
may
appear
to
you
mr
holmes
he
was
honestly
convinced
that
dreadful
fate
over
hung
his
family
and
certainly
the
records
which
he
was
able
to
give
of
his
ancestors
were
not
encouraging
the
idea
of
some
ghastly
presence
constantly
haunted
him
and
on
more
than
one
occasion
he
has
asked
me
whether
had
on
my
medical
journeys
at
night
ever
seen
any
strange
creature
or
heard
the
baying
of
hound
the
latter
question
he
put
to
me
several
times
and
always
with
voice
which
vibrated
with
excitement
can
well
remember
driving
up
to
his
house
in
the
evening
some
three
weeks
before
the
fatal
event
he
chanced
to
be
at
his
hall
door
had
descended
from
my
gig
and
was
standing
in
front
of
him
when
saw
his
eyes
fix
themselves
over
my
shoulder
and
stare
past
me
with
an
expression
of
the
most
dreadful
horror
whisked
round
and
had
just
time
to
catch
glimpse
of
something
which
took
to
be
large
black
calf
passing
at
the
head
of
the
drive
so
excited
and
alarmed
was
he
that
was
compelled
to
go
down
to
the
spot
where
the
animal
had
been
and
look
around
for
it
was
gone
however
and
the
incident
appeared
to
make
the
worst
impression
upon
his
mind
stayed
with
him
all
the
evening
and
it
was
on
that
occasion
to
explain
the
emotion
which
he
had
shown
that
he
confided
to
my
keeping
that
narrative
which
read
to
you
when
first
came
mention
this
small
episode
because
it
assumes
some
importance
in
view
of
the
tragedy
which
followed
but
was
convinced
at
the
time
that
the
matter
was
entirely
trivial
and
that
his
excitement
had
no
justification
it
was
at
my
advice
that
sir
charles
was
about
to
go
to
london
his
heart
was
knew
affected
and
the
constant
anxiety
in
which
he
lived
however
chimerical
the
cause
of
it
might
be
was
evidently
having
serious
effect
upon
his
health
thought
that
few
months
among
the
distractions
of
town
would
send
him
back
new
man
mr
stapleton
mutual
friend
who
was
much
concerned
at
his
state
of
health
was
of
the
same
opinion
at
the
last
instant
came
this
terrible
catastrophe
on
the
night
of
sir
charles
death
barrymore
the
butler
who
made
the
discovery
sent
perkins
the
groom
on
horseback
to
me
and
as
was
sitting
up
late
was
able
to
reach
baskerville
hall
within
an
hour
of
the
event
checked
and
corroborated
all
the
facts
which
were
mentioned
at
the
inquest
followed
the
footsteps
down
the
yew
alley
saw
the
spot
at
the
moor
gate
where
he
seemed
to
have
waited
remarked
the
change
in
the
shape
of
the
prints
after
that
point
noted
that
there
were
no
other
footsteps
save
those
of
barrymore
on
the
soft
gravel
and
finally
carefully
examined
the
body
which
had
not
been
touched
until
my
arrival
sir
charles
lay
on
his
face
his
arms
out
his
fingers
dug
into
the
ground
and
his
features
convulsed
with
some
strong
emotion
to
such
an
extent
that
could
hardly
have
sworn
to
his
identity
there
was
certainly
no
physical
injury
of
any
kind
but
one
false
statement
was
made
by
barrymore
at
the
inquest
he
said
that
there
were
no
traces
upon
the
ground
round
the
body
he
did
not
observe
any
but
did
some
little
distance
off
but
fresh
and
clear
footprints
man
or
woman
dr
mortimer
looked
strangely
at
us
for
an
instant
and
his
voice
sank
almost
to
whisper
as
he
answered
mr
holmes
they
were
the
footprints
of
gigantic
hound
iii
the
problem
confess
at
these
words
shudder
passed
through
me
there
was
thrill
in
the
doctor
voice
which
showed
that
he
was
himself
deeply
moved
by
that
which
he
told
us
holmes
leaned
forward
in
his
excitement
and
his
eyes
had
the
hard
dry
glitter
which
shot
from
them
when
he
was
keenly
interested
you
saw
this
as
clearly
as
see
you
and
you
said
nothing
what
was
the
use
how
was
it
that
no
one
else
saw
it

the
marks
were
some
twenty
yards
from
the
body
and
no
one
gave
them
thought
don
suppose
should
have
done
so
had
not
known
this
legend
there
are
many
sheep
dogs
on
the
moor
no
doubt
but
this
was
no
sheep
dog
you
say
it
was
large
enormous
but
it
had
not
approached
the
body
no
what
sort
of
night
was
it
damp
and
raw
but
not
actually
raining
no
what
is
the
alley
like
there
are
two
lines
of
old
yew
hedge
twelve
feet
high
and
impenetrable
the
walk
in
the
centre
is
about
eight
feet
across
is
there
anything
between
the
hedges
and
the
walk
yes
there
is
strip
of
grass
about
six
feet
broad
on
either
side
understand
that
the
yew
hedge
is
penetrated
at
one
point
by
gate
yes
the
wicket
gate
which
leads
on
to
the
moor
is
there
any
other
opening
none
so
that
to
reach
the
yew
alley
one
either
has
to
come
down
it
from
the
house
or
else
to
enter
it
by
the
moor
gate
there
is
an
exit
through
summer
house
at
the
far
end
had
sir
charles
reached
this
no
he
lay
about
fifty
yards
from
it
now
tell
me
dr
mortimer
and
this
is
important
themarks
which
you
saw
were
on
the
path
and
not
on
the
grass
no
marks
could
show
on
the
grass
were
they
on
the
same
side
of
the
path
as
the
moor
gate
yes
they
were
on
the
edge
of
the
path
on
the
same
side
as
the
moor
gate
you
interest
me
exceedingly
another
point
was
the
wicket
gate
closed
and
padlocked
how
high
was
it
about
four
feet
high
then
anyone
could
have
got
over
it
yes
and
what
marks
did
you
see
by
the
wicket
gate
none
in
particular
good
heaven
did
no
one
examine
yes
examined
myself
and
found
nothing
it
was
all
very
confused
sir
charles
had
evidently
stood
there
for
five
or
ten
minutes
how
do
you
know
that
because
the
ash
had
twice
dropped
from
his
cigar
excellent
this
is
colleague
watson
after
our
own
heart
but
the
marks
he
had
left
his
own
marks
all
over
that
small
patch
of
gravel
could
discern
no
others
sherlock
holmes
struck
his
hand
against
his
knee
with
an
impatient
gesture
if
had
only
been
there
he
cried
it
is
evidently
case
of
extraordinary
interest
and
one
which
presented
immense
opportunities
to
the
scientific
expert
that
gravel
page
upon
which
might
have
read
so
much
has
been
long
ere
this
smudged
by
the
rain
and
defaced
by
the
clogs
of
curious
peasants
oh
dr
mortimer
dr
mortimer
to
think
that
you
should
not
have
called
me
in
you
have
indeed
much
to
answer
for
could
not
call
you
in
mr
holmes
without
disclosing
these
facts
to
the
world
and
have
already
given
my
reasons
for
not
wishing
to
do
so
besides
besides—
why
do
you
hesitate
there
is
realm
in
which
the
most
acute
and
most
experienced
of
detectives
is
helpless
you
mean
that
the
thing
is
supernatural
did
not
positively
say
so
no
but
you
evidently
think
it
since
the
tragedy
mr
holmes
there
have
come
to
my
ears
several
incidents
which
are
hard
to
reconcile
with
the
settled
order
of
nature
for
example
find
that
before
the
terrible
event
occurred
several
people
had
seen
creature
upon
the
moor
which
corresponds
with
this
baskerville
demon
and
which
could
not
possibly
be
any
animal
known
to
science
they
all
agreed
that
it
was
huge
creature
luminous
ghastly
and
spectral
have
cross
examined
these
men
one
of
them
hard
headed
countryman
one
farrier
and
one
moorland
farmer
who
all
tell
the
same
story
of
this
dreadful
apparition
exactly
corresponding
to
the
hell
hound
of
the
legend
assure
you
that
there
is
reign
of
terror
in
the
district
and
that
it
is
hardy
man
who
will
cross
the
moor
at
night
and
you
trained
man
of
science
believe
it
to
be
supernatural
do
not
know
what
to
believe
holmes
shrugged
his
shoulders
have
hitherto
confined
my
investigations
to
this
world
said
he
in
modest
way
have
combated
evil
but
to
take
on
the
father
of
evil
himself
would
perhaps
be
too
ambitious
task
yet
you
must
admit
that
the
footmark
is
material
the
original
hound
was
material
enough
to
tug
man
throat
out
and
yet
he
was
diabolical
as
well
see
that
you
have
quite
gone
over
to
the
supernaturalists
but
now
dr
mortimer
tell
me
this
if
you
hold
these
views
why
have
you
come
to
consult
me
at
all
you
tell
me
in
the
same
breath
that
it
is
useless
to
investigate
sir
charles
death
and
that
you
desire
me
to
do
it
did
not
say
that
desired
you
to
do
it
then
how
can
assist
you
by
advising
me
as
to
what
should
do
with
sir
henry
baskerville
who
arrives
at
waterloo
station
dr
mortimer
looked
at
his
watch—
in
exactly
one
hour
and
quarter
he
being
the
heir
yes
on
the
death
of
sir
charles
we
inquired
for
this
young
gentleman
and
found
that
he
had
been
farming
in
canada
from
the
accounts
which
have
reached
us
he
is
an
excellent
fellow
in
every
way
speak
not
as
medical
man
but
as
trustee
and
executor
of
sir
charles
will
there
is
no
other
claimant
presume
none
the
only
other
kinsman
whom
we
have
been
able
to
trace
was
rodger
baskerville
the
youngest
of
three
brothers
of
whom
poor
sir
charles
was
the
elder
the
second
brother
who
died
young
is
the
father
of
this
lad
henry
the
third
rodger
was
the
black
sheep
of
the
family
he
came
of
the
old
masterful
baskerville
strain
and
was
the
very
image
they
tell
me
of
the
family
picture
of
old
hugo
he
made
england
too
hot
to
hold
him
fled
to
central
america
and
died
there
in
1876
of
yellow
fever
henry
is
the
last
of
the
baskervilles
in
one
hour
and
five
minutes
meet
him
at
waterloo
station
have
had
wire
that
he
arrived
at
southampton
this
morning
now
mr
holmes
what
would
you
advise
me
to
do
with
him
why
should
he
not
go
to
the
home
of
his
fathers
it
seems
natural
does
it
not
and
yet
consider
that
every
baskerville
who
goes
there
meets
with
an
evil
fate
feel
sure
that
if
sir
charles
could
have
spoken
with
me
before
his
death
he
would
have
warned
me
against
bringing
this
the
last
of
the
old
race
and
the
heir
to
great
wealth
to
that
deadly
place
and
yet
it
cannot
be
denied
that
the
prosperity
of
the
whole
poor
bleak
countryside
depends
upon
his
presence
all
the
good
work
which
has
been
done
by
sir
charles
will
crash
to
the
ground
if
there
is
no
tenant
of
the
hall
fear
lest
should
be
swayed
too
much
by
my
own
obvious
interest
in
the
matter
and
that
is
why
bring
the
case
before
you
and
ask
for
your
advice
holmes
considered
for
little
time
put
into
plain
words
the
matter
is
this
said
he
in
your
opinion
there
is
diabolical
agency
which
makes
dartmoor
an
unsafe
abode
for
baskerville
that
is
your
opinion
at
least
might
go
the
length
of
saying
that
there
is
some
evidence
that
this
may
be
so
exactly
but
surely
if
your
supernatural
theory
be
correct
it
could
work
the
young
man
evil
in
london
as
easily
as
in
devonshire
devil
with
merely
local
powers
like
parish
vestry
would
be
too
inconceivable
thing
you
put
the
matter
more
flippantly
mr
holmes
than
you
would
probably
do
if
you
were
brought
into
personal
contact
with
these
things
your
advice
then
as
understand
it
is
that
the
young
man
will
be
as
safe
in
devonshire
as
in
london
he
comes
in
fifty
minutes
what
would
you
recommend
sir
that
you
take
cab
call
off
your
spaniel
who
is
scratching
at
my
front
door
and
proceed
to
waterloo
to
meet
sir
henry
baskerville
and
then
and
then
you
will
say
nothing
to
him
at
all
until
have
made
up
my
mind
about
the
matter
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
make
up
your
mind
twenty
four
hours
at
ten
clock
to
morrow
dr
mortimer
will
be
much
obliged
to
you
if
you
will
call
upon
me
here
and
it
will
be
of
help
to
me
in
my
plans
for
the
future
if
you
will
bring
sir
henry
baskerville
with
you
will
do
so
mr
holmes
he
scribbled
the
appointment
on
his
shirt
cuff
and
hurried
off
in
his
strange
peering
absent
minded
fashion
holmes
stopped
him
at
the
head
of
the
stair
only
one
more
question
dr
mortimer
you
say
that
before
sir
charles
baskerville
death
several
people
saw
this
apparition
upon
the
moor
three
people
did
any
see
it
after
have
not
heard
of
any
thank
you
good
morning
holmes
returned
to
his
seat
with
that
quiet
look
of
inward
satisfaction
which
meant
that
he
had
congenial
task
before
him

going
out
watson
unless
can
help
you
no
my
dear
fellow
it
is
at
the
hour
of
action
that
turn
to
you
for
aid
but
this
is
splendid
really
unique
from
some
points
of
view
when
you
pass
bradley
would
you
ask
him
to
send
up
pound
of
the
strongest
shag
tobacco
thank
you
it
would
be
as
well
if
you
could
make
it
convenient
not
to
return
before
evening
then
should
be
very
glad
to
compare
impressions
as
to
this
most
interesting
problem
which
has
been
submitted
to
us
this
morning
knew
that
seclusion
and
solitude
were
very
necessary
for
my
friend
in
those
hours
of
intense
mental
concentration
during
which
he
weighed
every
particle
of
evidence
constructed
alternative
theories
balanced
one
against
the
other
and
made
up
his
mind
as
to
which
points
were
essential
and
which
immaterial
therefore
spent
the
day
at
my
club
and
did
not
return
to
baker
street
until
evening
it
was
nearly
nine
clock
when
found
myself
in
the
sitting
room
once
more
my
first
impression
as
opened
the
door
was
that
fire
had
broken
out
for
the
room
was
so
filled
with
smoke
that
the
light
of
the
lamp
upon
the
table
was
blurred
by
it
as
entered
however
my
fears
were
set
at
rest
for
it
was
the
acrid
fumes
of
strong
coarse
tobacco
which
took
me
by
the
throat
and
set
me
coughing
through
the
haze
had
vague
vision
of
holmes
in
his
dressing
gown
coiled
up
in
an
armchair
with
his
black
clay
pipe
between
his
lips
several
rolls
of
paper
lay
around
him
caught
cold
watson
said
he
no
it
this
poisonous
atmosphere
suppose
it
is
pretty
thick
now
that
you
mention
it
thick
it
is
intolerable
open
the
window
then
you
have
been
at
your
club
all
day
perceive
my
dear
holmes
am
right
certainly
but
how—
he
laughed
at
my
bewildered
expression
there
is
delightful
freshness
about
you
watson
which
makes
it
pleasure
to
exercise
any
small
powers
which
possess
at
your
expense
gentleman
goes
forth
on
showery
and
miry
day
he
returns
immaculate
in
the
evening
with
the
gloss
still
on
his
hat
and
his
boots
he
has
been
fixture
therefore
all
day
he
is
not
man
with
intimate
friends
where
then
could
he
have
been
is
it
not
obvious
well
it
is
rather
obvious
the
world
is
full
of
obvious
things
which
nobody
by
any
chance
ever
observes
where
do
you
think
that
have
been
fixture
also
on
the
contrary
have
been
to
devonshire
in
spirit
exactly
my
body
has
remained
in
this
arm
chair
and
has
regret
to
observe
consumed
in
my
absence
two
large
pots
of
coffee
and
an
incredible
amount
of
tobacco
after
you
left
sent
down
to
stamford
for
the
ordnance
map
of
this
portion
of
the
moor
and
my
spirit
has
hovered
over
it
all
day
flatter
myself
that
could
find
my
way
about
large
scale
map
presume
very
large
he
unrolled
one
section
and
held
it
over
his
knee
here
you
have
the
particular
district
which
concerns
us
that
is
baskerville
hall
in
the
middle
with
wood
round
it
exactly
fancy
the
yew
alley
though
not
marked
under
that
name
must
stretch
along
this
line
with
the
moor
as
you
perceive
upon
the
right
of
it
this
small
clump
of
buildings
here
is
the
hamlet
of
grimpen
where
our
friend
dr
mortimer
has
his
headquarters
within
radius
of
five
miles
there
are
as
you
see
only
very
few
scattered
dwellings
here
is
lafter
hall
which
was
mentioned
in
the
narrative
there
is
house
indicated
here
which
may
be
the
residence
of
the
naturalist
stapleton
if
remember
right
was
his
name
here
are
two
moorland
farm
houses
high
tor
and
foulmire
then
fourteen
miles
away
the
great
convict
prison
of
princetown
between
and
around
these
scattered
points
extends
the
desolate
lifeless
moor
this
then
is
the
stage
upon
which
tragedy
has
been
played
and
upon
which
we
may
help
to
play
it
again
it
must
be
wild
place
yes
the
setting
is
worthy
one
if
the
devil
did
desire
to
have
hand
in
the
affairs
of
men—
then
you
are
yourself
inclining
to
the
supernatural
explanation
the
devil
agents
may
be
of
flesh
and
blood
may
they
not
there
are
two
questions
waiting
for
us
at
the
outset
the
one
is
whether
any
crime
has
been
committed
at
all
the
second
is
what
is
the
crime
and
how
was
it
committed
of
course
if
dr
mortimer
surmise
should
be
correct
and
we
are
dealing
with
forces
outside
the
ordinary
laws
of
nature
there
is
an
end
of
our
investigation
but
we
are
bound
to
exhaust
all
other
hypotheses
before
falling
back
upon
this
one
think
we
ll
shut
that
window
again
if
you
don
mind
it
is
singular
thing
but
find
that
concentrated
atmosphere
helps
concentration
of
thought
have
not
pushed
it
to
the
length
of
getting
into
box
to
think
but
that
is
the
logical
outcome
of
my
convictions
have
you
turned
the
case
over
in
your
mind
yes
have
thought
good
deal
of
it
in
the
course
of
the
day
what
do
you
make
of
it
is
very
bewildering
it
has
certainly
character
of
its
own
there
are
points
of
distinction
about
it
that
change
in
the
footprints
for
example
what
do
you
make
of
that
mortimer
said
that
the
man
had
walked
on
tiptoe
down
that
portion
of
the
alley
he
only
repeated
what
some
fool
had
said
at
the
inquest
why
should
man
walk
on
tiptoe
down
the
alley
what
then
he
was
running
watson
running
desperately
running
for
his
life
running
until
he
burst
his
heart
and
fell
dead
upon
his
face
running
from
what
there
lies
our
problem
there
are
indications
that
the
man
was
crazed
with
fear
before
ever
he
began
to
run
how
can
you
say
that
am
presuming
that
the
cause
of
his
fears
came
to
him
across
the
moor
if
that
were
so
and
it
seems
most
probable
only
man
who
had
lost
his
wits
would
have
run
from
the
house
instead
of
towards
it
if
the
gipsy
evidence
may
be
taken
as
true
he
ran
with
cries
for
help
in
the
direction
where
help
was
least
likely
to
be
then
again
whom
was
he
waiting
for
that
night
and
why
was
he
waiting
for
him
in
the
yew
alley
rather
than
in
his
own
house
you
think
that
he
was
waiting
for
someone
the
man
was
elderly
and
infirm
we
can
understand
his
taking
an
evening
stroll
but
the
ground
was
damp
and
the
night
inclement
is
it
natural
that
he
should
stand
for
five
or
ten
minutes
as
dr
mortimer
with
more
practical
sense
than
should
have
given
him
credit
for
deduced
from
the
cigar
ash
but
he
went
out
every
evening
think
it
unlikely
that
he
waited
at
the
moor
gate
every
evening
on
the
contrary
the
evidence
is
that
he
avoided
the
moor
that
night
he
waited
there
it
was
the
night
before
he
made
his
departure
for
london
the
thing
takes
shape
watson
it
becomes
coherent
might
ask
you
to
hand
me
my
violin
and
we
will
postpone
all
further
thought
upon
this
business
until
we
have
had
the
advantage
of
meeting
dr
mortimer
and
sir
henry
baskerville
in
the
morning
iv
sir
henry
baskerville
our
breakfast
table
was
cleared
early
and
holmes
waited
in
his
dressing
gown
for
the
promised
interview
our
clients
were
punctual
to
their
appointment
for
the
clock
had
just
struck
ten
when
dr
mortimer
was
shown
up
followed
by
the
young
baronet
the
latter
was
small
alert
dark
eyed
man
about
thirty
years
of
age
very
sturdily
built
with
thick
black
eyebrows
and
strong
pugnacious
face
he
wore
ruddy
tinted
tweed
suit
and
had
the
weather
beaten
appearance
of
one
who
has
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
open
air
and
yet
there
was
something
in
his
steady
eye
and
the
quiet
assurance
of
his
bearing
which
indicated
the
gentleman
this
is
sir
henry
baskerville
said
dr
mortimer
why
yes
said
he
and
the
strange
thing
is
mr
sherlock
holmes
that
if
my
friend
here
had
not
proposed
coming
round
to
you
this
morning
should
have
come
on
my
own
account
understand
that
you
think
out
little
puzzles
and
ve
had
one
this
morning
which
wants
more
thinking
out
than
am
able
to
give
it
pray
take
seat
sir
henry
do
understand
you
to
say
that
you
have
yourself
had
some
remarkable
experience
since
you
arrived
in
london
nothing
of
much
importance
mr
holmes
only
joke
as
like
as
not
it
was
this
letter
if
you
can
call
it
letter
which
reached
me
this
morning
he
laid
an
envelope
upon
the
table
and
we
all
bent
over
it
was
of
common
quality
greyish
in
colour
the
address
sir
henry
baskerville
northumberland
hotel
was
printed
in
rough
characters
the
postmark
charing
cross
and
the
date
of
posting
the
preceding
evening
who
knew
that
you
were
going
to
the
northumberland
hotel
asked
holmes
glancing
keenly
across
at
our
visitor
no
one
could
have
known
we
only
decided
after
met
dr
mortimer
страница

but
dr
mortimer
was
no
doubt
already
stopping
there
no
had
been
staying
with
friend
said
the
doctor
there
was
no
possible
indication
that
we
intended
to
go
to
this
hotel
hum
someone
seems
to
be
very
deeply
interested
in
your
movements
out
of
the
envelope
he
took
half
sheet
of
foolscap
paper
folded
into
four
this
he
opened
and
spread
flat
upon
the
table
across
the
middle
of
it
single
sentence
had
been
formed
by
the
expedient
of
pasting
printed
words
upon
it
ran
as
you
value
your
life
or
your
reason
keep
away
from
the
moor
the
word
moor
only
was
printed
in
ink
now
said
sir
henry
baskerville
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
mr
holmes
what
in
thunder
is
the
meaning
of
that
and
who
it
is
that
takes
so
much
interest
in
my
affairs
what
do
you
make
of
it
dr
mortimer
you
must
allow
that
there
is
nothing
supernatural
about
this
at
any
rate
no
sir
but
it
might
very
well
come
from
someone
who
was
convinced
that
the
business
is
supernatural
what
business
asked
sir
henry
sharply
it
seems
to
me
that
all
you
gentlemen
know
great
deal
more
than
do
about
my
own
affairs
you
shall
share
our
knowledge
before
you
leave
this
room
sir
henry
promise
you
that
said
sherlock
holmes
we
will
confine
ourselves
for
the
present
with
your
permission
to
this
very
interesting
document
which
must
have
been
put
together
and
posted
yesterday
evening
have
you
yesterday
times
watson
it
is
here
in
the
corner
might
trouble
you
for
it
the
inside
page
please
with
the
leading
articles
he
glanced
swiftly
over
it
running
his
eyes
up
and
down
the
columns
capital
article
this
on
free
trade
permit
me
to
give
you
an
extract
from
it
you
may
be
cajoled
into
imagining
that
your
own
special
trade
or
your
own
industry
will
be
encouraged
by
protective
tariff
but
it
stands
to
reason
that
such
legislation
must
in
the
long
run
keep
away
wealth
from
the
country
diminish
the
value
of
our
imports
and
lower
the
general
conditions
of
life
in
this
island
what
do
you
think
of
that
watson
cried
holmes
in
high
glee
rubbing
his
hands
together
with
satisfaction
don
you
think
that
is
an
admirable
sentiment
dr
mortimer
looked
at
holmes
with
an
air
of
professional
interest
and
sir
henry
baskerville
turned
pair
of
puzzled
dark
eyes
upon
me
don
know
much
about
the
tariff
and
things
of
that
kind
said
he
but
it
seems
to
me
we
ve
got
bit
off
the
trail
so
far
as
that
note
is
concerned
on
the
contrary
think
we
are
particularly
hot
upon
the
trail
sir
henry
watson
here
knows
more
about
my
methods
than
you
do
but
fear
that
even
he
has
not
quite
grasped
the
significance
of
this
sentence
no
confess
that
see
no
connection
and
yet
my
dear
watson
there
is
so
very
close
connection
that
the
one
is
extracted
out
of
the
other
you
your
life
reason
value
keep
away
from
the
don
you
see
now
whence
these
words
have
been
taken
by
thunder
you
re
right
well
if
that
isn
smart
cried
sir
henry
if
any
possible
doubt
remained
it
is
settled
by
the
fact
that
keep
away
and
from
the
are
cut
out
in
one
piece
well
now
so
it
is
really
mr
holmes
this
exceeds
anything
which
could
have
imagined
said
dr
mortimer
gazing
at
my
friend
in
amazement
could
understand
anyone
saying
that
the
words
were
from
newspaper
but
that
you
should
name
which
and
add
that
it
came
from
the
leading
article
is
really
one
of
the
most
remarkable
things
which
have
ever
known
how
did
you
do
it
presume
doctor
that
you
could
tell
the
skull
of
negro
from
that
of
an
esquimaux
most
certainly
but
how
because
that
is
my
special
hobby
the
differences
are
obvious
the
supra
orbital
crest
the
facial
angle
the
maxillary
curve
the—
but
this
is
my
special
hobby
and
the
differences
are
equally
obvious
there
is
as
much
difference
to
my
eyes
between
the
leaded
bourgeois
type
of
times
article
and
the
slovenly
print
of
an
evening
halfpenny
paper
as
there
could
be
between
your
negro
and
your
esquimaux
the
detection
of
types
is
one
of
the
most
elementary
branches
of
knowledge
to
the
special
expert
in
crime
though
confess
that
once
when
was
very
young
confused
the
leeds
mercury
with
the
western
morning
news
but
times
leader
is
entirely
distinctive
and
these
words
could
have
been
taken
from
nothing
else
as
it
was
done
yesterday
the
strong
probability
was
that
we
should
find
the
words
in
yesterday
issue
so
far
as
can
follow
you
then
mr
holmes
said
sir
henry
baskerville
someone
cut
out
this
message
with
scissors—
nail
scissors
said
holmes
you
can
see
that
it
was
very
short
bladed
scissors
since
the
cutter
had
to
take
two
snips
over
keep
away
that
is
so
someone
then
cut
out
the
message
with
pair
of
short
bladed
scissors
pasted
it
with
paste—
gum
said
holmes
with
gum
on
to
the
paper
but
want
to
know
why
the
word
moor
should
have
been
written
because
he
could
not
find
it
in
print
the
other
words
were
all
simple
and
might
be
found
in
any
issue
but
moor
would
be
less
common
why
of
course
that
would
explain
it
have
you
read
anything
else
in
this
message
mr
holmes
there
are
one
or
two
indications
and
yet
the
utmost
pains
have
been
taken
to
remove
all
clues
the
address
you
observe
is
printed
in
rough
characters
but
the
times
is
paper
which
is
seldom
found
in
any
hands
but
those
of
the
highly
educated
we
may
take
it
therefore
that
the
letter
was
composed
by
an
educated
man
who
wished
to
pose
as
an
uneducated
one
and
his
effort
to
conceal
his
own
writing
suggests
that
writing
might
be
known
or
come
to
be
known
by
you
again
you
will
observe
that
the
words
are
not
gummed
on
in
an
accurate
line
but
that
some
are
much
higher
than
others
life
for
example
is
quite
out
of
its
proper
place
that
may
point
to
carelessness
or
it
may
point
to
agitation
and
hurry
upon
the
part
of
the
cutter
on
the
whole
incline
to
the
latter
view
since
the
matter
was
evidently
important
and
it
is
unlikely
that
the
composer
of
such
letter
would
be
careless
if
he
were
in
hurry
it
opens
up
the
interesting
question
why
he
should
be
in
hurry
since
any
letter
posted
up
to
early
morning
would
reach
sir
henry
before
he
would
leave
his
hotel
did
the
composer
fear
an
interruption
and
from
whom
we
are
coming
now
rather
into
the
region
of
guesswork
said
dr
mortimer
say
rather
into
the
region
where
we
balance
probabilities
and
choose
the
most
likely
it
is
the
scientific
use
of
the
imagination
but
we
have
always
some
material
basis
on
which
to
start
our
speculation
now
you
would
call
it
guess
no
doubt
but
am
almost
certain
that
this
address
has
been
written
in
hotel
how
in
the
world
can
you
say
that
if
you
examine
it
carefully
you
will
see
that
both
the
pen
and
the
ink
have
given
the
writer
trouble
the
pen
has
spluttered
twice
in
single
word
and
has
run
dry
three
times
in
short
address
showing
that
there
was
very
little
ink
in
the
bottle
now
private
pen
or
ink
bottle
is
seldom
allowed
to
be
in
such
state
and
the
combination
of
the
two
must
be
quite
rare
but
you
know
the
hotel
ink
and
the
hotel
pen
where
it
is
rare
to
get
anything
else
yes
have
very
little
hesitation
in
saying
that
could
we
examine
the
wastepaper
baskets
of
the
hotels
around
charing
cross
until
we
found
the
remains
of
the
mutilated
times
leader
we
could
lay
our
hands
straight
upon
the
person
who
sent
this
singular
message
halloa
what
this
he
was
carefully
examining
the
foolscap
upon
which
the
words
were
pasted
holding
it
only
an
inch
or
two
from
his
eyes
well
nothing
said
he
throwing
it
down
it
is
blank
half
sheet
of
paper
without
even
water
mark
upon
it
think
we
have
drawn
as
much
as
we
can
from
this
curious
letter
and
now
sir
henry
has
anything
else
of
interest
happened
to
you
since
you
have
been
in
london
why
no
mr
holmes
think
not
you
have
not
observed
anyone
follow
or
watch
you
seem
to
have
walked
right
into
the
thick
of
dime
novel
said
our
visitor
why
in
thunder
should
anyone
follow
or
watch
me
we
are
coming
to
that
you
have
nothing
else
to
report
to
us
before
we
go
into
this
matter
well
it
depends
upon
what
you
think
worth
reporting
think
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
routine
of
life
well
worth
reporting
sir
henry
smiled
don
know
much
of
british
life
yet
for
have
spent
nearly
all
my
time
in
the
states
and
in
canada
but
hope
that
to
lose
one
of
your
boots
is
not
part
of
the
ordinary
routine
of
life
over
here
you
have
lost
one
of
your
boots
my
dear
sir
cried
dr
mortimer
it
is
only
mislaid
you
will
find
it
when
you
return
to
the
hotel
what
is
the
use
of
troubling
mr
holmes
with
trifles
of
this
kind

well
he
asked
me
for
anything
outside
the
ordinary
routine
exactly
said
holmes
however
foolish
the
incident
may
seem
you
have
lost
one
of
your
boots
you
say
well
mislaid
it
anyhow
put
them
both
outside
my
door
last
night
and
there
was
only
one
in
the
morning
could
get
no
sense
out
of
the
chap
who
cleans
them
the
worst
of
it
is
that
only
bought
the
pair
last
night
in
the
strand
and
have
never
had
them
on
if
you
have
never
worn
them
why
did
you
put
them
out
to
be
cleaned
they
were
tan
boots
and
had
never
been
varnished
that
was
why
put
them
out
then
understand
that
on
your
arrival
in
london
yesterday
you
went
out
at
once
and
bought
pair
of
boots
did
good
deal
of
shopping
dr
mortimer
here
went
round
with
me
you
see
if
am
to
be
squire
down
there
must
dress
the
part
and
it
may
be
that
have
got
little
careless
in
my
ways
out
west
among
other
things
bought
these
brown
boots
gave
six
dollars
for
them
and
had
one
stolen
before
ever
had
them
on
my
feet
it
seems
singularly
useless
thing
to
steal
said
sherlock
holmes
confess
that
share
dr
mortimer
belief
that
it
will
not
be
long
before
the
missing
boot
is
found
and
now
gentlemen
said
the
baronet
with
decision
it
seems
to
me
that
have
spoken
quite
enough
about
the
little
that
know
it
is
time
that
you
kept
your
promise
and
gave
me
full
account
of
what
we
are
all
driving
at
your
request
is
very
reasonable
one
holmes
answered
dr
mortimer
think
you
could
not
do
better
than
to
tell
your
story
as
you
told
it
to
us
thus
encouraged
our
scientific
friend
drew
his
papers
from
his
pocket
and
presented
the
whole
case
as
he
had
done
upon
the
morning
before
sir
henry
baskerville
listened
with
the
deepest
attention
and
with
an
occasional
exclamation
of
surprise
well
seem
to
have
come
into
an
inheritance
with
vengeance
said
he
when
the
long
narrative
was
finished
of
course
ve
heard
of
the
hound
ever
since
was
in
the
nursery
it
the
pet
story
of
the
family
though
never
thought
of
taking
it
seriously
before
but
as
to
my
uncle
death
well
it
all
seems
boiling
up
in
my
head
and
can
get
it
clear
yet
you
don
seem
quite
to
have
made
up
your
mind
whether
it
case
for
policeman
or
clergyman
precisely
and
now
there
this
affair
of
the
letter
to
me
at
the
hotel
suppose
that
fits
into
its
place
it
seems
to
show
that
someone
knows
more
than
we
do
about
what
goes
on
upon
the
moor
said
dr
mortimer
and
also
said
holmes
that
someone
is
not
ill
disposed
towards
you
since
they
warn
you
of
danger
or
it
may
be
that
they
wish
for
their
own
purposes
to
scare
me
away
well
of
course
that
is
possible
also
am
very
much
indebted
to
you
dr
mortimer
for
introducing
me
to
problem
which
presents
several
interesting
alternatives
but
the
practical
point
which
we
now
have
to
decide
sir
henry
is
whether
it
is
or
is
not
advisable
for
you
to
go
to
baskerville
hall
why
should
not
go
there
seems
to
be
danger
do
you
mean
danger
from
this
family
fiend
or
do
you
mean
danger
from
human
beings
well
that
is
what
we
have
to
find
out
whichever
it
is
my
answer
is
fixed
there
is
no
devil
in
hell
mr
holmes
and
there
is
no
man
upon
earth
who
can
prevent
me
from
going
to
the
home
of
my
own
people
and
you
may
take
that
to
be
my
final
answer
his
dark
brows
knitted
and
his
face
flushed
to
dusky
red
as
he
spoke
it
was
evident
that
the
fiery
temper
of
the
baskervilles
was
not
extinct
in
this
their
last
representative
meanwhile
said
he
have
hardly
had
time
to
think
over
all
that
you
have
told
me
it
big
thing
for
man
to
have
to
understand
and
to
decide
at
one
sitting
should
like
to
have
quiet
hour
by
myself
to
make
up
my
mind
now
look
here
mr
holmes
it
half
past
eleven
now
and
am
going
back
right
away
to
my
hotel
suppose
you
and
your
friend
dr
watson
come
round
and
lunch
with
us
at
two
ll
be
able
to
tell
you
more
clearly
then
how
this
thing
strikes
me
is
that
convenient
to
you
watson
perfectly
then
you
may
expect
us
shall
have
cab
called
prefer
to
walk
for
this
affair
has
flurried
me
rather
ll
join
you
in
walk
with
pleasure
said
his
companion
then
we
meet
again
at
two
clock
au
revoir
and
good
morning
we
heard
the
steps
of
our
visitors
descend
the
stair
and
the
bang
of
the
front
door
in
an
instant
holmes
had
changed
from
the
languid
dreamer
to
the
man
of
action
your
hat
and
boots
watson
quick
not
moment
to
lose
he
rushed
into
his
room
in
his
dressing
gown
and
was
back
again
in
few
seconds
in
frock
coat
we
hurried
together
down
the
stairs
and
into
the
street
dr
mortimer
and
baskerville
were
still
visible
about
two
hundred
yards
ahead
of
us
in
the
direction
of
oxford
street
shall
run
on
and
stop
them
not
for
the
world
my
dear
watson
am
perfectly
satisfied
with
your
company
if
you
will
tolerate
mine
our
friends
are
wise
for
it
is
certainly
very
fine
morning
for
walk
he
quickened
his
pace
until
we
had
decreased
the
distance
which
divided
us
by
about
half
then
still
keeping
hundred
yards
behind
we
followed
into
oxford
street
and
so
down
regent
street
once
our
friends
stopped
and
stared
into
shop
window
upon
which
holmes
did
the
same
an
instant
afterwards
he
gave
little
cry
of
satisfaction
and
following
the
direction
of
his
eager
eyes
saw
that
hansom
cab
with
man
inside
which
had
halted
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
was
now
proceeding
slowly
onward
again
there
our
man
watson
come
along
we
ll
have
good
look
at
him
if
we
can
do
no
more
at
that
instant
was
aware
of
bushy
black
beard
and
pair
of
piercing
eyes
turned
upon
us
through
the
side
window
of
the
cab
instantly
the
trap
door
at
the
top
flew
up
something
was
screamed
to
the
driver
and
the
cab
flew
madly
off
down
regent
street
holmes
looked
eagerly
round
for
another
but
no
empty
one
was
in
sight
then
he
dashed
in
wild
pursuit
amid
the
stream
of
the
traffic
but
the
start
was
too
great
and
already
the
cab
was
out
of
sight
there
now
said
holmes
bitterly
as
he
emerged
panting
and
white
with
vexation
from
the
tide
of
vehicles
was
ever
such
bad
luck
and
such
bad
management
too
watson
if
you
are
an
honest
man
you
will
record
this
also
and
set
it
against
my
successes
who
was
the
man
have
not
an
idea
spy
well
it
was
evident
from
what
we
have
heard
that
baskerville
has
been
very
closely
shadowed
by
someone
since
he
has
been
in
town
how
else
could
it
be
known
so
quickly
that
it
was
the
northumberland
hotel
which
he
had
chosen
if
they
had
followed
him
the
first
day
argued
that
they
would
follow
him
also
the
second
you
may
have
observed
that
twice
strolled
over
to
the
window
while
dr
mortimer
was
reading
his
legend
yes
remember
was
looking
out
for
loiterers
in
the
street
but
saw
none
we
are
dealing
with
clever
man
watson
this
matter
cuts
very
deep
and
though
have
not
finally
made
up
my
mind
whether
it
is
benevolent
or
malevolent
agency
which
is
in
touch
with
us
am
conscious
always
of
power
and
design
when
our
friends
left
at
once
followed
them
in
the
hopes
of
marking
down
their
invisible
attendant
so
wily
was
he
that
he
had
not
trusted
himself
upon
foot
but
he
had
availed
himself
of
cab
so
that
he
could
loiter
behind
or
dash
past
them
and
so
escape
their
notice
his
method
had
the
additional
advantage
that
if
they
were
to
take
cab
he
was
all
ready
to
follow
them
it
has
however
one
obvious
disadvantage
it
puts
him
in
the
power
of
the
cabman
exactly
what
pity
we
did
not
get
the
number
my
dear
watson
clumsy
as
have
been
you
surely
do
not
seriously
imagine
that
neglected
to
get
the
number
2704
is
our
man
but
that
is
no
use
to
us
for
the
moment
fail
to
see
how
you
could
have
done
more
on
observing
the
cab
should
have
instantly
turned
and
walked
in
the
other
direction
should
then
at
my
leisure
have
hired
second
cab
and
followed
the
first
at
respectful
distance
or
better
still
have
driven
to
the
northumberland
hotel
and
waited
there
when
our
unknown
had
followed
baskerville
home
we
should
have
had
the
opportunity
of
playing
his
own
game
upon
himself
and
seeing
where
he
made
for
as
it
is
by
an
indiscreet
eagerness
which
was
taken
advantage
of
with
extraordinary
quickness
and
energy
by
our
opponent
we
have
betrayed
ourselves
and
lost
our
man
we
had
been
sauntering
slowly
down
regent
street
during
this
conversation
and
dr
mortimer
with
his
companion
had
long
vanished
in
front
of
us
there
is
no
object
in
our
following
them
said
holmes
the
shadow
has
departed
and
will
not
return
we
must
see
what
further
cards
we
have
in
our
hands
and
play
them
with
decision
could
you
swear
to
that
man
face
within
the
cab
страница

could
swear
only
to
the
beard
and
so
could
from
which
gather
that
in
all
probability
it
was
false
one
clever
man
upon
so
delicate
an
errand
has
no
use
for
beard
save
to
conceal
his
features
come
in
here
watson
he
turned
into
one
of
the
district
messenger
offices
where
he
was
warmly
greeted
by
the
manager
ah
wilson
see
you
have
not
forgotten
the
little
case
in
which
had
the
good
fortune
to
help
you
no
sir
indeed
have
not
you
saved
my
good
name
and
perhaps
my
life
my
dear
fellow
you
exaggerate
have
some
recollection
wilson
that
you
had
among
your
boys
lad
named
cartwright
who
showed
some
ability
during
the
investigation
yes
sir
he
is
still
with
us
could
you
ring
him
up
thank
you
and
should
be
glad
to
have
change
of
this
five
pound
note
lad
of
fourteen
with
bright
keen
face
had
obeyed
the
summons
of
the
manager
he
stood
now
gazing
with
great
reverence
at
the
famous
detective
let
me
have
the
hotel
directory
said
holmes
thank
you
now
cartwright
there
are
the
names
of
twenty
three
hotels
here
all
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
charing
cross
do
you
see
yes
sir
you
will
visit
each
of
these
in
turn
yes
sir
you
will
begin
in
each
case
by
giving
the
outside
porter
one
shilling
here
are
twenty
three
shillings
yes
sir
you
will
tell
him
that
you
want
to
see
the
waste
paper
of
yesterday
you
will
say
that
an
important
telegram
has
miscarried
and
that
you
are
looking
for
it
you
understand
yes
sir
but
what
you
are
really
looking
for
is
the
centre
page
of
the
times
with
some
holes
cut
in
it
with
scissors
here
is
copy
of
the
times
it
is
this
page
you
could
easily
recognize
it
could
you
not
yes
sir
in
each
case
the
outside
porter
will
send
for
the
hall
porter
to
whom
also
you
will
give
shilling
here
are
twenty
three
shillings
you
will
then
learn
in
possibly
twenty
cases
out
of
the
twenty
three
that
the
waste
of
the
day
before
has
been
burned
or
removed
in
the
three
other
cases
you
will
be
shown
heap
of
paper
and
you
will
look
for
this
page
of
the
times
among
it
the
odds
are
enormously
against
your
finding
it
there
are
ten
shillings
over
in
case
of
emergencies
let
me
have
report
by
wire
at
baker
street
before
evening
and
now
watson
it
only
remains
for
us
to
find
out
by
wire
the
identity
of
the
cabman
no
2704
and
then
we
will
drop
into
one
of
the
bond
street
picture
galleries
and
fill
in
the
time
until
we
are
due
at
the
hotel
three
broken
threads
sherlock
holmes
had
in
very
remarkable
degree
the
power
of
detaching
his
mind
at
will
for
two
hours
the
strange
business
in
which
we
had
been
involved
appeared
to
be
forgotten
and
he
was
entirely
absorbed
in
the
pictures
of
the
modern
belgian
masters
he
would
talk
of
nothing
but
art
of
which
he
had
the
crudest
ideas
from
our
leaving
the
gallery
until
we
found
ourselves
at
the
northumberland
hotel
sir
henry
baskerville
is
upstairs
expecting
you
said
the
clerk
he
asked
me
to
show
you
up
at
once
when
you
came
have
you
any
objection
to
my
looking
at
your
register
said
holmes
not
in
the
least
the
book
showed
that
two
names
had
been
added
after
that
of
baskerville
one
was
theophilus
johnson
and
family
of
newcastle
the
other
mrs
oldmore
and
maid
of
high
lodge
alton
surely
that
must
be
the
same
johnson
whom
used
to
know
said
holmes
to
the
porter
lawyer
is
he
not
grey
headed
and
walks
with
limp
no
sir
this
is
mr
johnson
the
coal
owner
very
active
gentleman
not
older
than
yourself
surely
you
are
mistaken
about
his
trade
no
sir
he
has
used
this
hotel
for
many
years
and
he
is
very
well
known
to
us
ah
that
settles
it
mrs
oldmore
too
seem
to
remember
the
name
excuse
my
curiosity
but
often
in
calling
upon
one
friend
one
finds
another
she
is
an
invalid
lady
sir
her
husband
was
once
mayor
of
gloucester
she
always
comes
to
us
when
she
is
in
town
thank
you
am
afraid
cannot
claim
her
acquaintance
we
have
established
most
important
fact
by
these
questions
watson
he
continued
in
low
voice
as
we
went
upstairs
together
we
know
now
that
the
people
who
are
so
interested
in
our
friend
have
not
settled
down
in
his
own
hotel
that
means
that
while
they
are
as
we
have
seen
very
anxious
to
watch
him
they
are
equally
anxious
that
he
should
not
see
them
now
this
is
most
suggestive
fact
what
does
it
suggest
it
suggests
halloa
my
dear
fellow
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
as
we
came
round
the
top
of
the
stairs
we
had
run
up
against
sir
henry
baskerville
himself
his
face
was
flushed
with
anger
and
he
held
an
old
and
dusty
boot
in
one
of
his
hands
so
furious
was
he
that
he
was
hardly
articulate
and
when
he
did
speak
it
was
in
much
broader
and
more
western
dialect
than
any
which
we
had
heard
from
him
in
the
morning
seems
to
me
they
are
playing
me
for
sucker
in
this
hotel
he
cried
they
ll
find
they
ve
started
in
to
monkey
with
the
wrong
man
unless
they
are
careful
by
thunder
if
that
chap
can
find
my
missing
boot
there
will
be
trouble
can
take
joke
with
the
best
mr
holmes
but
they
ve
got
bit
over
the
mark
this
time
still
looking
for
your
boot
yes
sir
and
mean
to
find
it
but
surely
you
said
that
it
was
new
brown
boot
so
it
was
sir
and
now
it
an
old
black
one
what
you
don
mean
to
say—
that
just
what
do
mean
to
say
only
had
three
pairs
in
the
world
the
new
brown
the
old
black
and
the
patent
leathers
which
am
wearing
last
night
they
took
one
of
my
brown
ones
and
today
they
have
sneaked
one
of
the
black
well
have
you
got
it
speak
out
man
and
don
stand
staring
an
agitated
german
waiter
had
appeared
upon
the
scene
no
sir
have
made
inquiry
all
over
the
hotel
but
can
hear
no
word
of
it
well
either
that
boot
comes
back
before
sundown
or
ll
see
the
manager
and
tell
him
that
go
right
straight
out
of
this
hotel
it
shall
be
found
sir
promise
you
that
if
you
will
have
little
patience
it
will
be
found
mind
it
is
for
it
the
last
thing
of
mine
that
ll
lose
in
this
den
of
thieves
well
mr
holmes
you
ll
excuse
my
troubling
you
about
such
trifle—
think
it
well
worth
troubling
about
why
you
look
very
serious
over
it
how
do
you
explain
it
just
don
attempt
to
explain
it
seems
the
very
maddest
queerest
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
the
queerest
perhaps
said
holmes
thoughtfully
what
do
you
make
of
it
yourself
well
don
profess
to
understand
it
yet
this
case
of
yours
is
very
complex
sir
henry
when
taken
in
conjunction
with
your
uncle
death
am
not
sure
that
of
all
the
five
hundred
cases
of
capital
importance
which
have
handled
there
is
one
which
cuts
so
deep
but
we
hold
several
threads
in
our
hands
and
the
odds
are
that
one
or
other
of
them
guides
us
to
the
truth
we
may
waste
time
in
following
the
wrong
one
but
sooner
or
later
we
must
come
upon
the
right
we
had
pleasant
luncheon
in
which
little
was
said
of
the
business
which
had
brought
us
together
it
was
in
the
private
sitting
room
to
which
we
afterwards
repaired
that
holmes
asked
baskerville
what
were
his
intentions
to
go
to
baskerville
hall
and
when
at
the
end
of
the
week
on
the
whole
said
holmes
think
that
your
decision
is
wise
one
have
ample
evidence
that
you
are
being
dogged
in
london
and
amid
the
millions
of
this
great
city
it
is
difficult
to
discover
who
these
people
are
or
what
their
object
can
be
if
their
intentions
are
evil
they
might
do
you
mischief
and
we
should
be
powerless
to
prevent
it
you
did
not
know
dr
mortimer
that
you
were
followed
this
morning
from
my
house
dr
mortimer
started
violently
followed
by
whom
that
unfortunately
is
what
cannot
tell
you
have
you
among
your
neighbours
or
acquaintances
on
daftmoor
any
man
with
black
full
beard
no
or
let
me
see
why
yes
barrymore
sir
charles
butler
is
man
with
full
black
beard
ha
where
is
barrymore
he
is
in
charge
of
the
hall
we
had
best
ascertain
if
he
is
really
there
or
if
by
any
possibility
he
might
be
in
london
how
can
you
do
that
give
me
telegraph
form
is
all
ready
for
sir
henry
that
will
do
address
to
mr
barrymore
baskerville
hall
what
is
the
nearest
telegraph
office
grimpen
very
good
we
will
send
second

that
so
said
baskerville
by
the
way
dr
mortimer
who
is
this
barrymore
anyhow
he
is
the
son
of
the
old
caretaker
who
is
dead
they
have
looked
after
the
hall
for
four
generations
now
so
far
as
know
he
and
his
wife
are
as
respectable
couple
as
any
in
the
county
at
the
same
time
said
baskerville
it
clear
enough
that
so
long
as
there
are
none
of
the
family
at
the
hall
these
people
have
mighty
fine
home
and
nothing
to
do
that
is
true
did
barrymore
profit
at
all
by
sir
charles
will
asked
holmes
he
and
his
wife
had
five
hundred
pounds
each
ha
did
they
know
that
they
would
receive
this
yes
sir
charles
was
very
fond
of
talking
about
the
provisions
of
his
will
that
is
very
interesting
hope
said
dr
mortimer
that
you
do
not
look
with
suspicious
eyes
upon
everyone
who
received
legacy
from
sir
charles
for
also
had
thousand
pounds
left
to
me
indeed
and
anyone
else
there
were
many
insignificant
sums
to
individuals
and
large
number
of
public
charities
the
residue
all
went
to
sir
henry
and
how
much
was
the
residue
seven
hundred
and
forty
thousand
pounds
holmes
raised
his
eyebrows
in
surprise
had
no
idea
that
so
gigantic
sum
was
involved
said
he
sir
charles
had
the
reputation
of
being
rich
but
we
did
not
know
how
very
rich
he
was
until
we
came
to
examine
his
securities
the
total
value
of
the
estate
was
close
on
to
million
dear
me
it
is
stake
for
which
man
might
well
play
desperate
game
and
one
more
question
dr
mortimer
supposing
that
anything
happened
to
our
young
friend
here
you
will
forgive
the
unpleasant
hypothesis
who
would
inherit
the
estate
since
rodger
baskerville
sir
charles
younger
brother
died
unmarried
the
estate
would
descend
to
the
desmonds
who
are
distant
cousins
james
desmond
is
an
elderly
clergyman
in
westmorland
thank
you
these
details
are
all
of
great
interest
have
you
met
mr
james
desmond
yes
he
once
came
down
to
visit
sir
charles
he
is
man
of
venerable
appearance
and
of
saintly
life
remember
that
he
refused
to
accept
any
settlement
from
sir
charles
though
he
pressed
it
upon
him
and
this
man
of
simple
tastes
would
be
the
heir
to
sir
charles
thousands
he
would
be
the
heir
to
the
estate
because
that
is
entailed
he
would
also
be
the
heir
to
the
money
unless
it
were
willed
otherwise
by
the
present
owner
who
can
of
course
do
what
he
likes
with
it
and
have
you
made
your
will
sir
henry
no
mr
holmes
have
not
ve
had
no
time
for
it
was
only
yesterday
that
learned
how
matters
stood
but
in
any
case
feel
that
the
money
should
go
with
the
title
and
estate
that
was
my
poor
uncle
idea
how
is
the
owner
going
to
restore
the
glories
of
the
baskervilles
if
he
has
not
money
enough
to
keep
up
the
property
house
land
and
dollars
must
go
together
quite
so
well
sir
henry
am
of
one
mind
with
you
as
to
the
advisability
of
your
going
down
to
devonshire
without
delay
there
is
only
one
provision
which
must
make
you
certainly
must
not
go
alone
dr
mortimer
returns
with
me
but
dr
mortimer
has
his
practice
to
attend
to
and
his
house
is
miles
away
from
yours
with
all
the
good
will
in
the
world
he
may
be
unable
to
help
you
no
sir
henry
you
must
take
with
you
someone
trusty
man
who
will
be
always
by
your
side
it
is
possible
that
you
could
come
yourself
mr
holmes
if
matters
came
to
crisis
should
endeavour
to
be
present
in
person
but
you
can
understand
that
with
my
extensive
consulting
practice
and
with
the
constant
appeals
which
reach
me
from
many
quarters
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
be
absent
from
london
for
an
indefinite
time
at
the
present
instant
one
of
the
most
revered
names
in
england
is
being
besmirched
by
blackmailer
and
only
can
stop
disastrous
scandal
you
will
see
how
impossible
it
is
for
me
to
go
to
dartmoor
whom
would
you
recommend
then
holmes
laid
his
hand
upon
my
arm
if
my
friend
would
undertake
it
there
is
no
man
who
is
better
worth
having
at
your
side
when
you
are
in
tight
place
no
one
can
say
so
more
confidently
than
the
proposition
took
me
completely
by
surprise
but
before
had
time
to
answer
baskerville
seized
me
by
the
hand
and
wrung
it
heartily
well
now
that
is
real
kind
of
you
dr
watson
said
he
you
see
how
it
is
with
me
and
you
know
just
as
much
about
the
matter
as
do
if
you
will
come
down
to
baskerville
hall
and
see
me
through
ll
never
forget
it
the
promise
of
adventure
had
always
fascination
for
me
and
was
complimented
by
the
words
of
holmes
and
by
the
eagerness
with
which
the
baronet
hailed
me
as
companion
will
come
with
pleasure
said
do
not
know
how
could
employ
my
time
better
and
you
will
report
very
carefully
to
me
said
holmes
when
crisis
comes
as
it
will
do
will
direct
how
you
shall
act
suppose
that
by
saturday
all
might
be
ready
would
that
suit
dr
watson
perfectly
then
on
saturday
unless
you
hear
to
the
contrary
we
shall
meet
at
the
10
30
train
from
paddington
we
had
risen
to
depart
when
baskerville
gave
cry
of
triumph
and
diving
into
one
of
the
corners
of
the
room
he
drew
brown
boot
from
under
cabinet
my
missing
boot
he
cried
may
all
our
difficulties
vanish
as
easily
said
sherlock
holmes
but
it
is
very
singular
thing
dr
mortimer
remarked
searched
this
room
carefully
before
lunch
and
so
did
said
baskerville
every
inch
of
it
there
was
certainly
no
boot
in
it
then
in
that
case
the
waiter
must
have
placed
it
there
while
we
were
lunching
the
german
was
sent
for
but
professed
to
know
nothing
of
the
matter
nor
could
any
inquiry
clear
it
up
another
item
had
been
added
to
that
constant
and
apparently
purposeless
series
of
small
mysteries
which
had
succeeded
each
other
so
rapidly
setting
aside
the
whole
grim
story
of
sir
charles
death
we
had
line
of
inexplicable
incidents
all
within
the
limits
of
two
days
which
included
the
receipt
of
the
printed
letter
the
black
bearded
spy
in
the
hansom
the
loss
of
the
new
brown
boot
the
loss
of
the
old
black
boot
and
now
the
return
of
the
new
brown
boot
holmes
sat
in
silence
in
the
cab
as
we
drove
back
to
baker
street
and
knew
from
his
drawn
brows
and
keen
face
that
his
mind
like
my
own
was
busy
in
endeavouring
to
frame
some
scheme
into
which
all
these
strange
and
apparently
disconnected
episodes
could
be
fitted
all
afternoon
and
late
into
the
evening
he
sat
lost
in
tobacco
and
thought
just
before
dinner
two
telegrams
were
handed
in
the
first
ran
have
just
heard
that
barrymore
is
at
the
hall
baskerville
the
second
visited
twenty
three
hotels
as
directed
but
sorry
to
report
unable
to
trace
cut
sheet
of
times
cartwright
there
go
two
of
my
threads
watson
there
is
nothing
more
stimulating
than
case
where
everything
goes
against
you
we
must
cast
round
for
another
scent
we
have
still
the
cabman
who
drove
the
spy
exactly
have
wired
to
get
his
name
and
address
from
the
official
registry
should
not
be
surprised
if
this
were
an
answer
to
my
question
the
ring
at
the
bell
proved
to
be
something
even
more
satisfactory
than
an
answer
however
for
the
door
opened
and
rough
looking
fellow
entered
who
was
evidently
the
man
himself
got
message
from
the
head
office
that
gent
at
this
address
had
been
inquiring
for
2704
said
he
ve
driven
my
cab
this
seven
years
and
never
word
of
complaint
came
here
straight
from
the
yard
to
ask
you
to
your
face
what
you
had
against
me
have
nothing
in
the
world
against
you
my
good
man
said
holmes
on
the
contrary
have
half
sovereign
for
you
if
you
will
give
me
clear
answer
to
my
questions
well
ve
had
good
day
and
no
mistake
said
the
cabman
with
grin
what
was
it
you
wanted
to
ask
sir
first
of
all
your
name
and
address
in
case
want
you
again
john
clayton
turpey
street
the
borough
my
cab
is
out
of
shipley
yard
near
waterloo
station
sherlock
holmes
made
note
of
it
now
clayton
tell
me
all
about
the
fare
who
came
and
watched
this
house
at
ten
clock
this
morning
and
afterwards
followed
the
two
gentlemen
down
regent
street
the
man
looked
surprised
and
little
embarrassed
why
there
no
good
my
telling
you
things
for
you
seem
to
know
as
much
as
do
already
said
he
the
truth
is
that
the
gentleman
told
me
that
he
was
detective
and
that
was
to
say
nothing
about
him
to
anyone
my
good
fellow
this
is
very
serious
business
and
you
may
find
yourself
in
pretty
bad
position
if
you
try
to
hide
anything
from
me
you
say
that
your
fare
told
you
that
he
was
detective
страница

yes
he
did
when
did
he
say
this
when
he
left
me
did
he
say
anything
more
he
mentioned
his
name
holmes
cast
swift
glance
of
triumph
at
me
oh
he
mentioned
his
name
did
he
that
was
imprudent
what
was
the
name
that
he
mentioned
his
name
said
the
cabman
was
mr
sherlock
holmes
never
have
seen
my
friend
more
completely
taken
aback
than
by
the
cabman
reply
for
an
instant
he
sat
in
silent
amazement
then
he
burst
into
hearty
laugh
touch
watson
an
undeniable
touch
said
he
feel
foil
as
quick
and
supple
as
my
own
he
got
home
upon
me
very
prettily
that
time
so
his
name
was
sherlock
holmes
was
it
yes
sir
that
was
the
gentleman
name
excellent
tell
me
where
you
picked
him
up
and
all
that
occurred
he
hailed
me
at
half
past
nine
in
trafalgar
square
he
said
that
he
was
detective
and
he
offered
me
two
guineas
if
would
do
exactly
what
he
wanted
all
day
and
ask
no
questions
was
glad
enough
to
agree
first
we
drove
down
to
the
northumberland
hotel
and
waited
there
until
two
gentlemen
came
out
and
took
cab
from
the
rank
we
followed
their
cab
until
it
pulled
up
somewhere
near
here
this
very
door
said
holmes
well
couldn
be
sure
of
that
but
dare
say
my
fare
knew
all
about
it
we
pulled
up
half
way
down
the
street
and
waited
an
hour
and
half
then
the
two
gentlemen
passed
us
walking
and
we
followed
down
baker
street
and
along—
know
said
holmes
until
we
got
three
quarters
down
regent
street
then
my
gentleman
threw
up
the
trap
and
he
cried
that
should
drive
right
away
to
waterloo
station
as
hard
as
could
go
whipped
up
the
mare
and
we
were
there
under
the
ten
minutes
then
he
paid
up
his
two
guineas
like
good
one
and
away
he
went
into
the
station
only
just
as
he
was
leaving
he
turned
round
and
he
said
it
might
interest
you
to
know
that
you
have
been
driving
mr
sherlock
holmes
that
how
come
to
know
the
name
see
and
you
saw
no
more
of
him
not
after
he
went
into
the
station
and
how
would
you
describe
mr
sherlock
holmes
the
cabman
scratched
his
head
well
he
wasn
altogether
such
an
easy
gentleman
to
describe
put
him
at
forty
years
of
age
and
he
was
of
middle
height
two
or
three
inches
shorter
than
you
sir
he
was
dressed
like
toff
and
he
had
black
beard
cut
square
at
the
end
and
pale
face
don
know
as
could
say
more
than
that
colour
of
his
eyes
no
can
say
that
nothing
more
that
you
can
remember
no
sir
nothing
well
then
here
is
your
half
sovereign
there
another
one
waiting
for
you
if
you
can
bring
any
more
information
good
night
good
night
sir
and
thank
you
john
clayton
departed
chuckling
and
holmes
turned
to
me
with
shrug
of
his
shoulders
and
rueful
smile
snap
goes
our
third
thread
and
we
end
where
we
began
said
he
the
cunning
rascal
he
knew
our
number
knew
that
sir
henry
baskerville
had
consulted
me
spotted
who
was
in
regent
street
conjectured
that
had
got
the
number
of
the
cab
and
would
lay
my
hands
on
the
driver
and
so
sent
back
this
audacious
message
tell
you
watson
this
time
we
have
got
foeman
who
is
worthy
of
our
steel
ve
been
checkmated
in
london
can
only
wish
you
better
luck
in
devonshire
but
not
easy
in
my
mind
about
it
about
what
about
sending
you
it
an
ugly
business
watson
an
ugly
dangerous
business
and
the
more
see
of
it
the
less
like
it
yes
my
dear
fellow
you
may
laugh
but
give
you
my
word
that
shall
be
very
glad
to
have
you
back
safe
and
sound
in
baker
street
once
more
vi
baskerville
hall
sir
henry
baskerville
and
dr
mortimer
were
ready
upon
the
appointed
day
and
we
started
as
arranged
for
devonshire
mr
sherlock
holmes
drove
with
me
to
the
station
and
gave
me
his
last
parting
injunction
and
advice
will
not
bias
your
mind
by
suggesting
theories
or
suspicions
watson
said
he
wish
you
simply
to
report
facts
in
the
fullest
possible
manner
to
me
and
you
can
leave
me
to
do
the
theorizing
what
sort
of
facts
asked
anything
which
may
seem
to
have
bearing
however
indirect
upon
the
case
and
especially
the
relations
between
young
baskerville
and
his
neighbours
or
any
fresh
particulars
concerning
the
death
of
sir
charles
have
made
some
inquiries
myself
in
the
last
few
days
but
the
results
have
fear
been
negative
one
thing
only
appears
to
be
certain
and
that
is
that
mr
james
desmond
who
is
the
next
heir
is
an
elderly
gentleman
of
very
amiable
disposition
so
that
this
persecution
does
not
arise
from
him
really
think
that
we
may
eliminate
him
entirely
from
our
calculations
there
remain
the
people
who
will
actually
surround
sir
henry
baskerville
upon
the
moor
would
it
not
be
well
in
the
first
place
to
get
rid
of
this
barrymore
couple
by
no
means
you
could
not
make
greater
mistake
if
they
are
innocent
it
would
be
cruel
injustice
and
if
they
are
guilty
we
should
be
giving
up
all
chance
of
bringing
it
home
to
them
no
we
will
preserve
them
upon
our
list
of
suspects
then
there
is
groom
at
the
hall
if
remember
right
there
are
two
moorland
farmers
there
is
our
friend
dr
mortimer
whom
believe
to
be
entirely
honest
and
there
is
his
wife
of
whom
we
know
nothing
there
is
this
naturalist
stapleton
and
there
is
his
sister
who
is
said
to
be
young
lady
of
attractions
there
is
mr
frankland
of
lafter
hall
who
is
also
an
unknown
factor
and
there
are
one
or
two
other
neighbours
these
are
the
folk
who
must
be
your
very
special
study
will
do
my
best
you
have
arms
suppose
yes
thought
it
as
well
to
take
them
most
certainly
keep
your
revolver
near
you
night
and
day
and
never
relax
your
precautions
our
friends
had
already
secured
first
class
carriage
and
were
waiting
for
us
upon
the
platform
no
we
have
no
news
of
any
kind
said
dr
mortimer
in
answer
to
my
friend
questions
can
swear
to
one
thing
and
that
is
that
we
have
not
been
shadowed
during
the
last
two
days
we
have
never
gone
out
without
keeping
sharp
watch
and
no
one
could
have
escaped
our
notice
you
have
always
kept
together
presume
except
yesterday
afternoon
usually
give
up
one
day
to
pure
amusement
when
come
to
town
so
spent
it
at
the
museum
of
the
college
of
surgeons
and
went
to
look
at
the
folk
in
the
park
said
baskerville
but
we
had
no
trouble
of
any
kind
it
was
imprudent
all
the
same
said
holmes
shaking
his
head
and
looking
very
grave
beg
sir
henry
that
you
will
not
go
about
alone
some
great
misfortune
will
befall
you
if
you
do
did
you
get
your
other
boot
no
sir
it
is
gone
forever
indeed
that
is
very
interesting
well
good
bye
he
added
as
the
train
began
to
glide
down
the
platform
bear
in
mind
sir
henry
one
of
the
phrases
in
that
queer
old
legend
which
dr
mortimer
has
read
to
us
and
avoid
the
moor
in
those
hours
of
darkness
when
the
powers
of
evil
are
exalted
looked
back
at
the
platform
when
we
had
left
it
far
behind
and
saw
the
tall
austere
figure
of
holmes
standing
motionless
and
gazing
after
us
the
journey
was
swift
and
pleasant
one
and
spent
it
in
making
the
more
intimate
acquaintance
of
my
two
companions
and
in
playing
with
dr
mortimer
spaniel
in
very
few
hours
the
brown
earth
had
become
ruddy
the
brick
had
changed
to
granite
and
red
cows
grazed
in
well
hedged
fields
where
the
lush
grasses
and
more
luxuriant
vegetation
spoke
of
richer
if
damper
climate
young
baskerville
stared
eagerly
out
of
the
window
and
cried
aloud
with
delight
as
he
recognized
the
familiar
features
of
the
devon
scenery
ve
been
over
good
part
of
the
world
since
left
it
dr
watson
said
he
but
have
never
seen
place
to
compare
with
it
never
saw
devonshire
man
who
did
not
swear
by
his
county
remarked
it
depends
upon
the
breed
of
men
quite
as
much
as
on
the
county
said
dr
mortimer
glance
at
our
friend
here
reveals
the
rounded
head
of
the
celt
which
carries
inside
it
the
celtic
enthusiasm
and
power
of
attachment
poor
sir
charles
head
was
of
very
rare
type
half
gaelic
half
ivernian
in
its
characteristics
but
you
were
very
young
when
you
last
saw
baskerville
hall
were
you
not
was
boy
in
my
teens
at
the
time
of
my
father
death
and
had
never
seen
the
hall
for
he
lived
in
little
cottage
on
the
south
coast
thence
went
straight
to
friend
in
america
tell
you
it
is
all
as
new
to
me
as
it
is
to
dr
watson
and
as
keen
as
possible
to
see
the
moor
are
you
then
your
wish
is
easily
granted
for
there
is
your
first
sight
of
the
moor

dr
mortimer
pointing
out
of
the

window

over
the
green
squares
of
the
fields
and
the
low
curve
of
wood
there
rose
in
the
distance
grey
melancholy
hill
with
strange
jagged
summit
dim
and
vague
in
the
distance
like
some
fantastic
landscape
in
dream
baskerville
sat
for
long
time
his
eyes
fixed
upon
it
and
read
upon
his
eager
face
how
much
it
meant
to
him
this
first
sight
of
that
strange
spot
where
the
men
of
his
blood
had
held
sway
so
long
and
left
their
mark
so
deep
there
he
sat
with
his
tweed
suit
and
his
american
accent
in
the
corner
of
prosaic
railway
carriage
and
yet
as
looked
at
his
dark
and
expressive
face
felt
more
than
ever
how
true
descendant
he
was
of
that
long
line
of
high
blooded
fiery
and
masterful
men
there
were
pride
valour
and
strength
in
his
thick
brows
his
sensitive
nostrils
and
his
large
hazel
eyes
if
on
that
forbidding
moor
difficult
and
dangerous
quest
should
lie
before
us
this
was
at
least
comrade
for
whom
one
might
venture
to
take
risk
with
the
certainty
that
he
would
bravely
share
it
the
train
pulled
up
at
small
wayside
station
and
we
all
descended
outside
beyond
the
low
white
fence
wagonette
with
pair
of
cobs
was
waiting
our
coming
was
evidently
great
event
for
station
master
and
porters
clustered
round
us
to
carry
out
our
luggage
it
was
sweet
simple
country
spot
but
was
surprised
to
observe
that
by
the
gate
there
stood
two
soldierly
men
in
dark
uniforms
who
leaned
upon
their
short
rifles
and
glanced
keenly
at
us
as
we
passed
the
coachman
hard
faced
gnarled
little
fellow
saluted
sir
henry
baskerville
and
in
few
minutes
we
were
flying
swiftly
down
the
broad
white
road
rolling
pasture
lands
curved
upward
on
either
side
of
us
and
old
gabled
houses
peeped
out
from
amid
the
thick
green
foliage
but
behind
the
peaceful
and
sunlit
country
side
there
rose
ever
dark
against
the
evening
sky
the
long
gloomy
curve
of
the
moor
broken
by
the
jagged
and
sinister
hills
the
wagonette
swung
round
into
side
road
and
we
curved
upward
through
deep
lanes
worn
by
centuries
of
wheels
high
banks
on
either
side
heavy
with
dripping
moss
and
fleshy
hart
tongue
ferns
bronzing
bracken
and
mottled
bramble
gleamed
in
the
light
of
the
sinking
sun
still
steadily
rising
we
passed
over
narrow
granite
bridge
and
skirted
noisy
stream
which
gushed
swiftly
down
foaming
and
roaring
amid
the
grey
boulders
both
road
and
stream
wound
up
through
valley
dense
with
scrub
oak
and
fir
at
every
turn
baskerville
gave
an
exclamation
of
delight
looking
eagerly
about
him
and
asking
countless
questions
to
his
eyes
all
seemed
beautiful
but
to
me
tinge
of
melancholy
lay
upon
the
countryside
which
bore
so
clearly
the
mark
of
the
waning
year
yellow
leaves
carpeted
the
lanes
and
fluttered
down
upon
us
as
we
passed
the
rattle
of
our
wheels
died
away
as
we
drove
through
drifts
of
rotting
vegetation
sad
gifts
as
it
seemed
to
me
for
nature
to
throw
before
the
carriage
of
the
returning
heir
of
the
baskervilles
halloa
cried
dr
mortimer
what
is
this
steep
curve
of
heath
clad
land
an
outlying
spur
of
the
moor
lay
in
front
of
us
on
the
summit
hard
and
clear
like
an
equestrian
statue
upon
its
pedestal
was
mounted
soldier
dark
and
stern
his
rifle
poised
ready
over
his
forearm
he
was
watching
the
road
along
which
we
travelled
what
is
this
perkins
asked
dr
mortimer
our
driver
half
turned
in
his
seat
there
convict
escaped
from
princetown
sir
he
been
out
three
days
now
and
the
warders
watch
every
road
and
every
station
but
they
ve
had
no
sight
of
him
yet
the
farmers
about
here
don
like
it
sir
and
that
fact
well
understand
that
they
get
five
pounds
if
they
can
give
information
yes
sir
but
the
chance
of
five
pounds
is
but
poor
thing
compared
to
the
chance
of
having
your
throat
cut
you
see
it
isn
like
any
ordinary
convict
this
is
man
that
would
stick
at
nothing
who
is
he
then
it
is
selden
the
notting
hill
murderer
remembered
the
case
well
for
it
was
one
in
which
holmes
had
taken
an
interest
on
account
of
the
peculiar
ferocity
of
the
crime
and
the
wanton
brutality
which
had
marked
all
the
actions
of
the
assassin
the
commutation
of
his
death
sentence
had
been
due
to
some
doubts
as
to
his
complete
sanity
so
atrocious
was
his
conduct
our
wagonette
had
topped
rise
and
in
front
of
us
rose
the
huge
expanse
of
the
moor
mottled
with
gnarled
and
craggy
cairns
and
tors
cold
wind
swept
down
from
it
and
set
us
shivering
somewhere
there
on
that
desolate
plain
was
lurking
this
fiendish
man
hiding
in
burrow
like
wild
beast
his
heart
full
of
malignancy
against
the
whole
race
which
had
cast
him
out
it
needed
but
this
to
complete
the
grim
suggestiveness
of
the
barren
waste
the
chilling
wind
and
the
darkling
sky
even
baskerville
fell
silent
and
pulled
his
overcoat
more
closely
around
him
we
had
left
the
fertile
country
behind
and
beneath
us
we
looked
back
on
it
now
the
slanting
rays
of
low
sun
turning
the
streams
to
threads
of
gold
and
glowing
on
the
red
earth
new
turned
by
the
plough
and
the
broad
tangle
of
the
woodlands
the
road
in
front
of
us
grew
bleaker
and
wilder
over
huge
russet
and
olive
slopes
sprinkled
with
giant
boulders
now
and
then
we
passed
moorland
cottage
walled
and
roofed
with
stone
with
no
creeper
to
break
its
harsh
outline
suddenly
we
looked
down
into
cup
like
depression
patched
with
stunted
oaks
and
firs
which
had
been
twisted
and
bent
by
the
fury
of
years
of
storm
two
high
narrow
towers
rose
over
the
trees
the
driver
pointed
with
his
whip
baskerville
hall
said
he
its
master
had
risen
and
was
staring
with
flushed
cheeks
and
shining
eyes
few
minutes
later
we
had
reached
the
lodge
gates
maze
of
fantastic
tracery
in
wrought
iron
with
weather
bitten
pillars
on
either
side
blotched
with
lichens
and
surmounted
by
the
boars
heads
of
the
baskervilles
the
lodge
was
ruin
of
black
granite
and
bared
ribs
of
rafters
but
facing
it
was
new
building
half
constructed
the
first
fruit
of
sir
charles
south
african
gold
through
the
gateway
we
passed
into
the
avenue
where
the
wheels
were
again
hushed
amid
the
leaves
and
the
old
trees
shot
their
branches
in
sombre
tunnel
over
our
heads
baskerville
shuddered
as
he
looked
up
the
long
dark
drive
to
where
the
house
glimmered
like
ghost
at
the
farther
end
was
it
here
he
asked
in
low
voice
no
the
yew
alley
is
on
the
other
side
the
young
heir
glanced
round
with
gloomy
face
it
no
wonder
my
uncle
felt
as
if
trouble
were
coming
on
him
in
such
place
as
this
said
he
it
enough
to
scare
any
man
ll
have
row
of
electric
lamps
up
here
inside
of
six
months
and
you
won
know
it
again
with
thousand
candle
power
swan
and
edison
right
here
in
front
of
the
hall
door
the
avenue
opened
into
broad
expanse
of
turf
and
the
house
lay
before
us
in
the
fading
light
could
see
that
the
centre
was
heavy
block
of
building
from
which
porch
projected
the
whole
front
was
draped
in
ivy
with
patch
clipped
bare
here
and
there
where
window
or
coat
of
arms
broke
through
the
dark
veil
from
this
central
block
rose
the
twin
towers
ancient
crenelated
and
pierced
with
many
loopholes
to
right
and
left
of
the
turrets
were
more
modern
wings
of
black
granite
dull
light
shone
through
heavy
mullioned
windows
and
from
the
high
chimneys
which
rose
from
the
steep
high
angled
roof
there
sprang
single
black
column
of
smoke
welcome
sir
henry
welcome
to
baskerville
hall
tall
man
had
stepped
from
the
shadow
of
the
porch
to
open
the
door
of
the
wagonette
the
figure
of
woman
was
silhouetted
against
the
yellow
light
of
the
hall
she
came
out
and
helped
the
man
to
hand
down
our
bags
you
don
mind
my
driving
straight
home
sir
henry
said
dr
mortimer
my
wife
is
expecting
me
surely
you
will
stay
and
have
some
dinner
no
must
go
shall
probably
find
some
work
awaiting
me
would
stay
to
show
you
over
the
house
but
barrymore
will
be
better
guide
than
good
bye
and
never
hesitate
night
or
day
to
send
for
me
if
can
be
of
service
the
wheels
died
away
down
the
drive
while
sir
henry
and
turned
into
the
hall
and
the
door
clanged
heavily
behind
us
it
was
fine
apartment
in
which
we
found
ourselves
large
lofty
and
heavily
raftered
with
huge
balks
of
age
blackened
oak
in
the
great
old
fashioned
fireplace
behind
the
high
iron
dogs
log
fire
crackled
and
snapped
sir
henry
and
held
out
our
hands
to
it
for
we
were
numb
from
our
long
drive
then
we
gazed
round
us
at
the
high
thin
window
of
old
stained
glass
the
oak
panelling
the
stags
heads
the
coats
of
arms
upon
the
walls
all
dim
and
sombre
in
the
subdued
light
of
the
central
lamp
it
just
as
imagined
it
said
sir
henry
is
it
not
the
very
picture
of
an
old
family
home
to
think
that
this
should
be
the
same
hall
in
which
for
five
hundred
years
my
people
have
lived
it
strikes
me
solemn
to
think
of

saw
his
dark
face
lit
up
with
boyish
enthusiasm
as
he
gazed
about
him
the
light
beat
upon
him
where
he
stood
but
long
shadows
trailed
down
the
walls
and
hung
like
black
canopy
above
him
barrymore
had
returned
from
taking
our
luggage
to
our
rooms
he
stood
in
front
of
us
now
with
the
subdued
manner
of
well
trained
servant
he
was
remarkable
looking
man
tall
handsome
with
square
black
beard
and
pale
distinguished
features
would
you
wish
dinner
to
be
served
at
once
sir
is
it
ready
in
very
few
minutes
sir
you
will
find
hot
water
in
your
rooms
my
wife
and
will
be
happy
sir
henry
to
stay
with
you
until
you
have
made
your
fresh
arrangements
but
you
will
understand
that
under
the
new
conditions
this
house
will
require
considerable
staff
what
new
conditions
only
meant
sir
that
sir
charles
led
very
retired
life
and
we
were
able
to
look
after
his
wants
you
would
naturally
wish
to
have
more
company
and
so
you
will
need
changes
in
your
household
do
you
mean
that
your
wife
and
you
wish
to
leave
only
when
it
is
quite
convenient
to
you
sir
but
your
family
have
been
with
us
for
several
generations
have
they
not
should
be
sorry
to
begin
my
life
here
by
breaking
an
old
family
connection
seemed
to
discern
some
signs
of
emotion
upon
the
butler
white
face
feel
that
also
sir
and
so
does
my
wife
but
to
tell
the
truth
sir
we
were
both
very
much
attached
to
sir
charles
and
his
death
gave
us
shock
and
made
these
surroundings
very
painful
to
us
fear
that
we
shall
never
again
be
easy
in
our
minds
at
baskerville
hall
but
what
do
you
intend
to
do
have
no
doubt
sir
that
we
shall
succeed
in
establishing
ourselves
in
some
business
sir
charles
generosity
has
given
us
the
means
to
do
so
and
now
sir
perhaps
had
best
show
you
to
your
rooms
square
balustraded
gallery
ran
round
the
top
of
the
old
hall
approached
by
double
stair
from
this
central
point
two
long
corridors
extended
the
whole
length
of
the
building
from
which
all
the
bedrooms
opened
my
own
was
in
the
same
wing
as
baskerville
and
almost
next
door
to
it
these
rooms
appeared
to
be
much
more
modern
than
the
central
part
of
the
house
and
the
bright
paper
and
numerous
candles
did
something
to
remove
the
sombre
impression
which
our
arrival
had
left
upon
my
mind
but
the
dining
room
which
opened
out
of
the
hall
was
place
of
shadow
and
gloom
it
was
long
chamber
with
step
separating
the
dais
where
the
family
sat
from
the
lower
portion
reserved
for
their
dependents
at
one
end
minstrel
gallery
overlooked
it
black
beams
shot
across
above
our
heads
with
smoke
darkened
ceiling
beyond
them
with
rows
of
flaring
torches
to
light
it
up
and
the
colour
and
rude
hilarity
of
an
old
time
banquet
it
might
have
softened
but
now
when
two
black
clothed
gentlemen
sat
in
the
little
circle
of
light
thrown
by
shaded
lamp
one
voice
became
hushed
and
one
spirit
subdued
dim
line
of
ancestors
in
every
variety
of
dress
from
the
elizabethan
knight
to
the
buck
of
the
regency
stared
down
upon
us
and
daunted
us
by
their
silent
company
we
talked
little
and
for
one
was
glad
when
the
meal
was
over
and
we
were
able
to
retire
into
the
modern
billiard
room
and
smoke
cigarette
my
word
it
isn
very
cheerful
place
said
sir
henry
suppose
one
can
tone
down
to
it
but
feel
bit
out
of
the
picture
at
present
don
wonder
that
my
uncle
got
little
jumpy
if
he
lived
all
alone
in
such
house
as
this
however
if
it
suits
you
we
will
retire
early
to
night
and
perhaps
things
may
seem
more
cheerful
in
the
morning
drew
aside
my
curtains
before
went
to
bed
and
looked
out
from
my
window
it
opened
upon
the
grassy
space
which
lay
in
front
of
the
hall
door
beyond
two
copses
of
trees
moaned
and
swung
in
rising
wind
half
moon
broke
through
the
rifts
of
racing
clouds
in
its
cold
light
saw
beyond
the
trees
broken
fringe
of
rocks
and
the
long
low
curve
of
the
melancholy
moor
closed
the
curtain
feeling
that
my
last
impression
was
in
keeping
with
the
rest
and
yet
it
was
not
quite
the
last
found
myself
weary
and
yet
wakeful
tossing
restlessly
from
side
to
side
seeking
for
the
sleep
which
would
not
come
far
away
chiming
clock
struck
out
the
quarters
of
the
hours
but
otherwise
deathly
silence
lay
upon
the
old
house
and
then
suddenly
in
the
very
dead
of
the
night
there
came
sound
to
my
ears
clear
resonant
and
unmistakable
it
was
the
sob
of
woman
the
muffled
strangling
gasp
of
one
who
is
torn
by
an
uncontrollable
sorrow
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
intently
the
noise
could
not
have
been
far
away
and
was
certainly
in
the
house
for
half
an
hour
waited
with
every
nerve
on
the
alert
but
there
came
no
other
sound
save
the
chiming
clock
and
the
rustle
of
the
ivy
on
the
wall
vii
the
stapletons
of
merripit
house
the
fresh
beauty
of
the
following
morning
did
something
to
efface
from
our
minds
the
grim
and
grey
impression
which
had
been
left
upon
both
of
us
by
our
first
experience
of
baskerville
hall
as
sir
henry
and
sat
at
breakfast
the
sunlight
flooded
in
through
the
high
mullioned
windows
throwing
watery
patches
of
colour
from
the
coats
of
arms
which
covered
them
the
dark
panelling
glowed
like
bronze
in
the
golden
rays
and
it
was
hard
to
realize
that
this
was
indeed
the
chamber
which
had
struck
such
gloom
into
our
souls
upon
the
evening
before
guess
it
is
ourselves
and
not
the
house
that
we
have
to
blame
said
the
baronet
we
were
tired
with
our
journey
and
chilled
by
our
drive
so
we
took
grey
view
of
the
place
now
we
are
fresh
and
well
so
it
is
all
cheerful
once
more
and
yet
it
was
not
entirely
question
of
imagination
answered
did
you
for
example
happen
to
hear
someone
woman
think
sobbing
in
the
night
that
is
curious
for
did
when
was
half
asleep
fancy
that
heard
something
of
the
sort
waited
quite
time
but
there
was
no
more
of
it
so
concluded
that
it
was
all
dream
heard
it
distinctly
and
am
sure
that
it
was
really
the
sob
of
woman
we
must
ask
about
this
right
away
he
rang
the
bell
and
asked
barrymore
whether
he
could
account
for
our
experience
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
pallid
features
of
the
butler
turned
shade
paler
still
as
he
listened
to
his
master
question
there
are
only
two
women
in
the
house
sir
henry
he
answered
one
is
the
scullery
maid
who
sleeps
in
the
other
wing
the
other
is
my
wife
and
can
answer
for
it
that
the
sound
could
not
have
come
from
her
and
yet
he
lied
as
he
said
it
for
it
chanced
that
after
breakfast
met
mrs
barrymore
in
the
long
corridor
with
the
sun
full
upon
her
face
she
was
large
impassive
heavy
featured
woman
with
stern
set
expression
of
mouth
but
her
tell
tale
eyes
were
red
and
glanced
at
me
from
between
swollen
lids
it
was
she
then
who
wept
in
the
night
and
if
she
did
so
her
husband
must
know
it
yet
he
had
taken
the
obvious
risk
of
discovery
in
declaring
that
it
was
not
so
why
had
he
done
this
and
why
did
she
weep
so
bitterly
already
round
this
pale
faced
handsome
black
bearded
man
there
was
gathering
an
atmosphere
of
mystery
and
of
gloom
it
was
he
who
had
been
the
first
to
discover
the
body
of
sir
charles
and
we
had
only
his
word
for
all
the
circumstances
which
led
up
to
the
old
man
death
was
it
possible
that
it
was
barrymore
after
all
whom
we
had
seen
in
the
cab
in
regent
street
the
beard
might
well
have
been
the
same
the
cabman
had
described
somewhat
shorter
man
but
such
an
impression
might
easily
have
been
erroneous
how
could
settle
the
point
forever
obviously
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
see
the
grimpen
postmaster
and
find
whether
the
test
telegram
had
really
been
placed
in
barrymore
own
hands
be
the
answer
what
it
might
should
at
least
have
something
to
report
to
sherlock
holmes
sir
henry
had
numerous
papers
to
examine
after
breakfast
so
that
the
time
was
propitious
for
my
excursion
it
was
pleasant
walk
of
four
miles
along
the
edge
of
the
moor
leading
me
at
last
to
small
grey
hamlet
in
which
two
larger
buildings
which
proved
to
be
the
inn
and
the
house
of
dr
mortimer
stood
high
above
the
rest
the
postmaster
who
was
also
the
village
grocer
had
clear
recollection
of
the
telegram
certainly
sir
said
he
had
the
telegram
delivered
to
mr
barrymore
exactly
as
directed
who
delivered
it
my
boy
here
james
you
delivered
that
telegram
to
mr
barrymore
at
the
hall
last
week
did
you
not
yes
father
delivered
it
into
his
own
hands
asked
well
he
was
up
in
the
loft
at
the
time
so
that
could
not
put
it
into
his
own
hands
but
gave
it
into
mrs
barrymore
hands
and
she
promised
to
deliver
it
at
once
did
you
see
mr
barrymore
no
sir
tell
you
he
was
in
the
loft
if
you
didn
see
him
how
do
you
know
he
was
in
the
loft

well
surely
his
own
wife
ought
to
know
where
he
is
said
the
postmaster
testily
didn
he
get
the
telegram
if
there
is
any
mistake
it
is
for
mr
barrymore
himself
to
complain
it
seemed
hopeless
to
pursue
the
inquiry
any
farther
but
it
was
clear
that
in
spite
of
holmes
ruse
we
had
no
proof
that
barrymore
had
not
been
in
london
all
the
time
suppose
that
it
were
so
suppose
that
the
same
man
had
been
the
last
who
had
seen
sir
charles
alive
and
the
first
to
dog
the
new
heir
when
he
returned
to
england
what
then
was
he
the
agent
of
others
or
had
he
some
sinister
design
of
his
own
what
interest
could
he
have
in
persecuting
the
baskerville
family
thought
of
the
strange
warning
clipped
out
of
the
leading
article
of
the
times
was
that
his
work
or
was
it
possibly
the
doing
of
someone
who
was
bent
upon
counteracting
his
schemes
the
only
conceivable
motive
was
that
which
had
been
suggested
by
sir
henry
that
if
the
family
could
be
scared
away
comfortable
and
permanent
home
would
be
secured
for
the
barrymores
but
surely
such
an
explanation
as
that
would
be
quite
inadequate
to
account
for
the
deep
and
subtle
scheming
which
seemed
to
be
weaving
an
invisible
net
round
the
young
baronet
holmes
himself
had
said
that
no
more
complex
case
had
come
to
him
in
all
the
long
series
of
his
sensational
investigations
prayed
as
walked
back
along
the
grey
lonely
road
that
my
friend
might
soon
be
freed
from
his
preoccupations
and
able
to
come
down
to
take
this
heavy
burden
of
responsibility
from
my
shoulders
suddenly
my
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
running
feet
behind
me
and
by
voice
which
called
me
by
name
turned
expecting
to
see
dr
mortimer
but
to
my
surprise
it
was
stranger
who
was
pursuing
me
he
was
small
slim
clean
shaven
prim
faced
man
flaxen
haired
and
lean
jawed
between
thirty
and
forty
years
of
age
dressed
in
grey
suit
and
wearing
straw
hat
tin
box
for
botanical
specimens
hung
over
his
shoulder
and
he
carried
green
butterfly
net
in
one
of
his
hands
you
will
am
sure
excuse
my
presumption
dr
watson
said
he
as
he
came
panting
up
to
where
stood
here
on
the
moor
we
are
homely
folk
and
do
not
wait
for
formal
introductions
you
may
possibly
have
heard
my
name
from
our
mutual
friend
mortimer
am
stapleton
of
merripit
house
your
net
and
box
would
have
told
me
as
much
said
for
knew
that
mr
stapleton
was
naturalist
but
how
did
you
know
me
have
been
calling
on
mortimer
and
he
pointed
you
out
to
me
from
the
window
of
his
surgery
as
you
passed
as
our
road
lay
the
same
way
thought
that
would
overtake
you
and
introduce
myself
trust
that
sir
henry
is
none
the
worse
for
his
journey
he
is
very
well
thank
you
we
were
all
rather
afraid
that
after
the
sad
death
of
sir
charles
the
new
baronet
might
refuse
to
live
here
it
is
asking
much
of
wealthy
man
to
come
down
and
bury
himself
in
place
of
this
kind
but
need
not
tell
you
that
it
means
very
great
deal
to
the
countryside
sir
henry
has
suppose
no
superstitious
fears
in
the
matter
do
not
think
that
it
is
likely
of
course
you
know
the
legend
of
the
fiend
dog
which
haunts
the
family
have
heard
it
is
extraordinary
how
credulous
the
peasants
are
about
here
any
number
of
them
are
ready
to
swear
that
they
have
seen
such
creature
upon
the
moor
he
spoke
with
smile
but
seemed
to
read
in
his
eyes
that
he
took
the
matter
more
seriously
the
story
took
great
hold
upon
the
imagination
of
sir
charles
and
have
no
doubt
that
it
led
to
his
tragic
end
but
how
his
nerves
were
so
worked
up
that
the
appearance
of
any
dog
might
have
had
fatal
effect
upon
his
diseased
heart
fancy
that
he
really
did
see
something
of
the
kind
upon
that
last
night
in
the
yew
alley
feared
that
some
disaster
might
occur
for
was
very
fond
of
the
old
man
and
knew
that
his
heart
was
weak
how
did
you
know
that
my
friend
mortimer
told
me
you
think
then
that
some
dog
pursued
sir
charles
and
that
he
died
of
fright
in
consequence
have
you
any
better
explanation
have
not
come
to
any
conclusion
has
mr
sherlock
holmes
the
words
took
away
my
breath
for
an
instant
but
glance
at
the
placid
face
and
steadfast
eyes
of
my
companion
showed
that
no
surprise
was
intended
it
is
useless
for
us
to
pretend
that
we
do
not
know
you
dr
watson
said
he
the
records
of
your
detective
have
reached
us
here
and
you
could
not
celebrate
him
without
being
known
yourself
when
mortimer
told
me
your
name
he
could
not
deny
your
identity
if
you
are
here
then
it
follows
that
mr
sherlock
holmes
is
interesting
himself
in
the
matter
and
am
naturally
curious
to
know
what
view
he
may
take
am
afraid
that
cannot
answer
that
question
may
ask
if
he
is
going
to
honour
us
with
visit
himself
he
cannot
leave
town
at
present
he
has
other
cases
which
engage
his
attention
what
pity
he
might
throw
some
light
on
that
which
is
so
dark
to
us
but
as
to
your
own
researches
if
there
is
any
possible
way
in
which
can
be
of
service
to
you
trust
that
you
will
command
me
if
had
any
indication
of
the
nature
of
your
suspicions
or
how
you
propose
to
investigate
the
case
might
perhaps
even
now
give
you
some
aid
or
advice
assure
you
that
am
simply
here
upon
visit
to
my
friend
sir
henry
and
that
need
no
help
of
any
kind
excellent
said
stapleton
you
are
perfectly
right
to
be
wary
and
discreet
am
justly
reproved
for
what
feel
was
an
unjustifiable
intrusion
and
promise
you
that
will
not
mention
the
matter
again
we
had
come
to
point
where
narrow
grassy
path
struck
off
from
the
road
and
wound
away
across
the
moor
steep
boulder
sprinkled
hill
lay
upon
the
right
which
had
in
bygone
days
been
cut
into
granite
quarry
the
face
which
was
turned
towards
us
formed
dark
cliff
with
ferns
and
brambles
growing
in
its
niches
from
over
distant
rise
there
floated
grey
plume
of
smoke
moderate
walk
along
this
moor
path
brings
us
to
merripit
house
said
he
perhaps
you
will
spare
an
hour
that
may
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
you
to
my
sister
my
first
thought
was
that
should
be
by
sir
henry
side
but
then
remembered
the
pile
of
papers
and
bills
with
which
his
study
table
was
littered
it
was
certain
that
could
not
help
with
those
and
holmes
had
expressly
said
that
should
study
the
neighbours
upon
the
moor
accepted
stapleton
invitation
and
we
turned
together
down
the
path
it
is
wonderful
place
the
moor
said
he
looking
round
over
the
undulating
downs
long
green
rollers
with
crests
of
jagged
granite
foaming
up
into
fantastic
surges
you
never
tire
of
the
moor
you
cannot
think
the
wonderful
secrets
which
it
contains
it
is
so
vast
and
so
barren
and
so
mysterious
you
know
it
well
then
have
only
been
here
two
years
the
residents
would
call
me
new
comer
we
came
shortly
after
sir
charles
settled
but
my
tastes
led
me
to
explore
every
part
of
the
country
round
and
should
think
that
there
are
few
men
who
know
it
better
than
do
is
it
hard
to
know
very
hard
you
see
for
example
this
great
plain
to
the
north
here
with
the
queer
hills
breaking
out
of
it
do
you
observe
anything
remarkable
about
that
it
would
be
rare
place
for
gallop
you
would
naturally
think
so
and
the
thought
has
cost
folk
their
lives
before
now
you
notice
those
bright
green
spots
scattered
thickly
over
it
yes
they
seem
more
fertile
than
the
rest
stapleton
laughed
that
is
the
great
grimpen
mire
said
he
false
step
yonder
means
death
to
man
or
beast
only
yesterday
saw
one
of
the
moor
ponies
wander
into
it
he
never
came
out
saw
his
head
for
quite
long
time
craning
out
of
the
bog
hole
but
it
sucked
him
down
at
last
even
in
dry
seasons
it
is
danger
to
cross
it
but
after
these
autumn
rains
it
is
an
awful
place
and
yet
can
find
my
way
to
the
very
heart
of
it
and
return
alive
by
george
there
is
another
of
those
miserable
ponies
something
brown
was
rolling
and
tossing
among
the
green
sedges
then
long
agonized
writhing
neck
shot
upward
and
dreadful
cry
echoed
over
the
moor
it
turned
me
cold
with
horror
but
my
companion
nerves
seemed
to
be
stronger
than
mine
it
gone
said
he
the
mire
has
him
two
in
two
days
and
many
more
perhaps
for
they
get
in
the
way
of
going
there
in
the
dry
weather
and
never
know
the
difference
until
the
mire
has
them
in
its
clutches
it
bad
place
the
great
grimpen
mire
and
you
say
you
can
penetrate
it
yes
there
are
one
or
two
paths
which
very
active
man
can
take
have
found
them
out
but
why
should
you
wish
to
go
into
so
horrible
place
well
you
see
the
hills
beyond
they
are
really
islands
cut
off
on
all
sides
by
the
impassable
mire
which
has
crawled
round
them
in
the
course
of
years
that
is
where
the
rare
plants
and
the
butterflies
are
if
you
have
the
wit
to
reach
them

he
looked
at
me
with

face
for

sake
put
such
an
idea
out
of
your

your
blood

cried
what
is
that
long
low
moan
indescribably
sad
swept
over
the
moor
it
filled
the
whole
air
and
yet
it
was
impossible
to
say
whence
it
came
from
dull
murmur
it
swelled
into
deep
roar
and
then
sank
back
into
melancholy
throbbing
murmur
once
again
stapleton
looked
at
me
with
curious
expression
in
his
face
queer
place
the
moor
said
he
but
what
is
it
the
peasants
say
it
is
the
hound
of
the
baskervilles
calling
for
its
prey
ve
heard
it
once
or
twice
before
but
never
quite
so
loud
looked
round
with
chill
of
fear
in
my
heart
at
the
huge
swelling
plain
mottled
with
the
green
patches
of
rushes
nothing
stirred
over
the
vast
expanse
save
pair
of
ravens
which
croaked
loudly
from
tor
behind
us
you
are
an
educated
man
you
don
believe
such
nonsense
as
that
said
what
do
you
think
is
the
cause
of
so
strange
sound
bogs
make
queer
noises
sometimes
it
the
mud
settling
or
the
water
rising
or
something
no
that
was
living
voice
well
perhaps
it
was
did
you
ever
hear
bittern
booming
no
never
did
it
very
rare
bird
practically
extinct
in
england
now
but
all
things
are
possible
upon
the
moor
yes
should
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
what
we
have
heard
is
the
cry
of
the
last
of
the
bitterns
it
the
weirdest
strangest
thing
that
ever
heard
in
my
life
yes
it
rather
an
uncanny
place
altogether
look
at
the
hillside
yonder
what
do
you
make
of
those
the
whole
steep
slope
was
covered
with
grey
circular
rings
of
stone
score
of
them
at
least
what
are
they
sheep
pens
no
they
are
the
homes
of
our
worthy
ancestors
prehistoric
man
lived
thickly
on
the
moor
and
as
no
one
in
particular
has
lived
there
since
we
find
all
his
little
arrangements
exactly
as
he
left
them
these
are
his
wigwams
with
the
roofs
off
you
can
even
see
his
hearth
and
his
couch
if
you
have
the
curiosity
to
go
inside
but
it
is
quite
town
when
was
it
inhabited
neolithic
man
no
date
what
did
he
do
he
grazed
his
cattle
on
these
slopes
and
he
learned
to
dig
for
tin
when
the
bronze
sword
began
to
supersede
the
stone
axe
look
at
the
great
trench
in
the
opposite
hill
that
is
his
mark
yes
you
will
find
some
very
singular
points
about
the
moor
dr
watson
oh
excuse
me
an
instant
it
is
surely
cyclopides
small
fly
or
moth
had
fluttered
across
our
path
and
in
an
instant
stapleton
was
rushing
with
extraordinary
energy
and
speed
in
pursuit
of
it
to
my
dismay
the
creature
flew
straight
for
the
great
mire
and
my
acquaintance
never
paused
for
an
instant
bounding
from
tuft
to
tuft
behind
it
his
green
net
waving
in
the
air
his
grey
clothes
and
jerky
zigzag
irregular
progress
made
him
not
unlike
some
huge
moth
himself
was
standing
watching
his
pursuit
with
mixture
of
admiration
for
his
extraordinary
activity
and
fear
lest
he
should
lose
his
footing
in
the
treacherous
mire
when
heard
the
sound
of
steps
and
turning
round
found
woman
near
me
upon
the
path
she
had
come
from
the
direction
in
which
the
plume
of
smoke
indicated
the
position
of
merripit
house
but
the
dip
of
the
moor
had
hid
her
until
she
was
quite
close
could
not
doubt
that
this
was
the
miss
stapleton
of
whom
had
been
told
since
ladies
of
any
sort
must
be
few
upon
the
moor
and
remembered
that
had
heard
someone
describe
her
as
being
beauty
the
woman
who
approached
me
was
certainly
that
and
of
most
uncommon
type
there
could
not
have
been
greater
contrast
between
brother
and
sister
for
stapleton
was
neutral
tinted
with
light
hair
and
grey
eyes
while
she
was
darker
than
any
brunette
whom
have
seen
in
england
slim
elegant
and
tall
she
had
proud
finely
cut
face
so
regular
that
it
might
have
seemed
impassive
were
it
not
for
the
sensitive
mouth
and
the
beautiful
dark
eager
eyes
with
her
perfect
figure
and
elegant
dress
she
was
indeed
strange
apparition
upon
lonely
moorland
path
her
eyes
were
on
her
brother
as
turned
and
then
she
quickened
her
pace
towards
me
had
raised
my
hat
and
was
about
to
make
some
explanatory
remark
when
her
own
words
turned
all
my
thoughts
into
new
channel
go
back
she
said
go
straight
back
to
london
instantly
could
only
stare
at
her
in
stupid
surprise
her
eyes
blazed
at
me
and
she
tapped
the
ground
impatiently
with
her
foot
why
should
go
back
asked
cannot
explain
she
spoke
in
low
eager
voice
with
curious
lisp
in
her
utterance
but
for
god
sake
do
what
ask
you
go
back
and
never
set
foot
upon
the
moor
again
but
have
only
just
come
man
she
cried
can
you
not
tell
when
warning
is
for
your
own
good
go
back
to
london
start
to
night
get
away
from
this
place
at
all
costs
hush
my
brother
is
coming
not
word
of
what
have
said
would
you
mind
getting
that
orchid
for
me
among
the
mares
tails
yonder
we
are
very
rich
in
orchids
on
the
moor
though
of
course
you
are
rather
late
to
see
the
beauties
of
the
place
stapleton
had
abandoned
the
chase
and
came
back
to
us
breathing
hard
and
flushed
with
his
exertions
halloa
beryl
said
he
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
tone
of
his
greeting
was
not
altogether
cordial
one
well
jack
you
are
very
hot
yes
was
chasing
cyclopides
he
is
very
rare
and
seldom
found
in
the
late
autumn
what
pity
that
should
have
missed
him
he
spoke
unconcernedly
but
his
small
light
eyes
glanced
incessantly
from
the
girl
to
me
you
have
introduced
yourselves
can
see
yes
was
telling
sir
henry
that
it
was
rather
late
for
him
to
see
the
true
beauties
of
the
moor
why
who
do
you
think
this
is
imagine
that
it
must
be
sir
henry
baskerville
no
said
only
humble
commoner
but
his
friend
my
name
is
dr
watson
flush
of
vexation
passed
over
her
expressive
face
we
have
been
talking
at
cross
purposes
said
she
why
you
had
not
very
much
time
for
talk
her
brother
remarked
with
the
same
questioning
eyes
talked
as
if
dr
watson
were
resident
instead
of
being
merely
visitor
said
she
it
cannot
much
matter
to
him
whether
it
is
early
or
late
for
the
orchids
but
you
will
come
on
will
you
not
and
see
merripit
house
short
walk
brought
us
to
it
bleak
moorland
house
once
the
farm
of
some
grazier
in
the
old
prosperous
days
but
now
put
into
repair
and
turned
into
modern
dwelling
an
orchard
surrounded
it
but
the
trees
as
is
usual
upon
the
moor
were
stunted
and
nipped
and
the
effect
of
the
whole
place
was
mean
and
melancholy
we
were
admitted
by
strange
wizened
rusty
coated
old
man
servant
who
seemed
in
keeping
with
the
house
inside
however
there
were
large
rooms
furnished
with
an
elegance
in
which
seemed
to
recognise
the
taste
of
the
lady
as
looked
from
their
windows
at
the
interminable
granite
flecked
moor
rolling
unbroken
to
the
farthest
horizon
could
not
but
marvel
at
what
could
have
brought
this
highly
educated
man
and
this
beautiful
woman
to
live
in
such
place
queer
spot
to
choose
is
it
not
said
he
as
if
in
answer
to
my
thought
and
yet
we
manage
to
make
ourselves
fairly
happy
do
we
not
beryl
quite
happy
said
she
but
there
was
no
ring
of
conviction
in
her
words
had
school
said
stapleton
it
was
in
the
north
country
the
work
to
man
of
my
temperament
was
mechanical
and
uninteresting
but
the
privilege
of
living
with
youth
of
helping
to
mould
those
young
minds
and
of
impressing
them
with
one
own
character
and
ideals
was
very
dear
to
me
however
the
fates
were
against
us
serious
epidemic
broke
out
in
the
school
and
three
of
the
boys
died
it
never
recovered
from
the
blow
and
much
of
my
capital
was
irretrievably
swallowed
up
and
yet
if
it
were
not
for
the
loss
of
the
charming
companionship
of
the
boys
could
rejoice
over
my
own
misfortune
for
with
my
strong
tastes
for
botany
and
zoology
find
an
unlimited
field
of
work
here
and
my
sister
is
as
devoted
to
nature
as
am
all
this
dr
watson
has
been
brought
upon
your
head
by
your
expression
as
you
surveyed
the
moor
out
of
our
window
it
certainly
did
cross
my
mind
that
it
might
be
little
dull
less
for
you
perhaps
than
for
your
sister
no
am
never
dull
said
she
quickly
we
have
books
we
have
our
studies
and
we
have
interesting
neighbours
dr
mortimer
is
most
learned
man
in
his
own
line
poor
sir
charles
was
also
an
admirable
companion
we
knew
him
well
and
miss
him
more
than
can
tell
do
you
think
that
should
intrude
if
were
to
call
this
afternoon
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
sir
henry
страница

am
sure
that
he
would
be
delighted
then
perhaps
you
would
mention
that
propose
to
do
so
we
may
in
our
humble
way
do
something
to
make
things
more
easy
for
him
until
he
becomes
accustomed
to
his
new
surroundings
will
you
come
upstairs
dr
watson
and
inspect
my
collection
of
lepidoptera
think
it
is
the
most
complete
one
in
the
south
west
of
england
by
the
time
that
you
have
looked
through
them
lunch
will
be
almost
ready
but
was
eager
to
get
back
to
my
charge
the
melancholy
of
the
moor
the
death
of
the
unfortunate
pony
the
weird
sound
which
had
been
associated
with
the
grim
legend
of
the
baskervilles
all
these
things
tinged
my
thoughts
with
sadness
then
on
the
top
of
these
more
or
less
vague
impressions
there
had
come
the
definite
and
distinct
warning
of
miss
stapleton
delivered
with
such
intense
earnestness
that
could
not
doubt
that
some
grave
and
deep
reason
lay
behind
it
resisted
all
pressure
to
stay
for
lunch
and
set
off
at
once
upon
my
return
journey
taking
the
grass
grown
path
by
which
we
had
come
it
seems
however
that
there
must
have
been
some
short
cut
for
those
who
knew
it
for
before
had
reached
the
road
was
astounded
to
see
miss
stapleton
sitting
upon
rock
by
the
side
of
the
track
her
face
was
beautifully
flushed
with
her
exertions
and
she
held
her
hand
to
her
side
have
run
all
the
way
in
order
to
cut
you
off
dr
watson
said
she
had
not
even
time
to
put
on
my
hat
must
not
stop
or
my
brother
may
miss
me
wanted
to
say
to
you
how
sorry
am
about
the
stupid
mistake
made
in
thinking
that
you
were
sir
henry
please
forget
the
words
said
which
have
no
application
whatever
to
you
but
can
forget
them
miss
stapleton
said
am
sir
henry
friend
and
his
welfare
is
very
close
concern
of
mine
tell
me
why
it
was
that
you
were
so
eager
that
sir
henry
should
return
to
london
woman
whim
dr
watson
when
you
know
me
better
you
will
understand
that
cannot
always
give
reasons
for
what
say
or
do
no
remember
the
thrill
in
your
voice
remember
the
look
in
your
eyes
please
be
frank
with
me
miss
stapleton
for
ever
since
have
been
here
have
been
conscious
of
shadows
all
round
me
life
has
become
like
that
great
grimpen
mire
with
little
green
patches
everywhere
into
which
one
may
sink
and
with
no
guide
to
point
the
track
tell
me
then
what
it
was
that
you
meant
and
will
promise
to
convey
your
warning
to
sir
henry
an
expression
of
irresolution
passed
for
an
instant
over
her
face
but
her
eyes
had
hardened
again
when
she
answered
me
you
make
too
much
of
it
dr
watson
said
she
my
brother
and
were
very
much
shocked
by
the
death
of
sir
charles
we
knew
him
very
intimately
for
his
favourite
walk
was
over
the
moor
to
our
house
he
was
deeply
impressed
with
the
curse
which
hung
over
the
family
and
when
this
tragedy
came
naturally
felt
that
there
must
be
some
grounds
for
the
fears
which
he
had
expressed
was
distressed
therefore
when
another
member
of
the
family
came
down
to
live
here
and
felt
that
he
should
be
warned
of
the
danger
which
he
will
run
that
was
all
which
intended
to
convey
but
what
is
the
danger
you
know
the
story
of
the
hound
do
not
believe
in
such
nonsense
but
do
if
you
have
any
influence
with
sir
henry
take
him
away
from
place
which
has
always
been
fatal
to
his
family
the
world
is
wide
why
should
he
wish
to
live
at
the
place
of
danger
because
it
is
the
place
of
danger
that
is
sir
henry
nature
fear
that
unless
you
can
give
me
some
more
definite
information
than
this
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
him
to
move
cannot
say
anything
definite
for
do
not
know
anything
definite
would
ask
you
one
more
question
miss
stapleton
if
you
meant
no
more
than
this
when
you
first
spoke
to
me
why
should
you
not
wish
your
brother
to
overhear
what
you
said
there
is
nothing
to
which
he
or
anyone
else
could
object
my
brother
is
very
anxious
to
have
the
hall
inhabited
for
he
thinks
it
is
for
the
good
of
the
poor
folk
upon
the
moor
he
would
be
very
angry
if
he
knew
that
have
said
anything
which
might
induce
sir
henry
to
go
away
but
have
done
my
duty
now
and
will
say
no
more
must
get
back
or
he
will
miss
me
and
suspect
that
have
seen
you
good
bye
she
turned
and
had
disappeared
in
few
minutes
among
the
scattered
boulders
while
with
my
soul
full
of
vague
fears
pursued
my
way
to
baskerville
hall
viii
first
report
of
dr
watson
from
this
point
onward
will
follow
the
course
of
events
by
transcribing
my
own
letters
to
mr
sherlock
holmes
which
lie
before
me
on
the
table
one
page
is
missing
but
otherwise
they
are
exactly
as
written
and
show
my
feelings
and
suspicions
of
the
moment
more
accurately
than
my
memory
clear
as
it
is
upon
these
tragic
events
can
possibly
do
baskerville
hall
oct
13th
my
dear
holmes
my
previous
letters
and
telegrams
have
kept
you
pretty
well
up
to
date
as
to
all
that
has
occurred
in
this
most
god
forsaken
corner
of
the
world
the
longer
one
stays
here
the
more
does
the
spirit
of
the
moor
sink
into
one
soul
its
vastness
and
also
its
grim
charm
when
you
are
once
out
upon
its
bosom
you
have
left
all
traces
of
modern
england
behind
you
but
on
the
other
hand
you
are
conscious
everywhere
of
the
homes
and
the
work
of
the
prehistoric
people
on
all
sides
of
you
as
you
walk
are
the
houses
of
these
forgotten
folk
with
their
graves
and
the
huge
monoliths
which
are
supposed
to
have
marked
their
temples
as
you
look
at
their
grey
stone
huts
against
the
scarred
hill
sides
you
leave
your
own
age
behind
you
and
if
you
were
to
see
skin
clad
hairy
man
crawl
out
from
the
low
door
fitting
flint
tipped
arrow
on
to
the
string
of
his
bow
you
would
feel
that
his
presence
there
was
more
natural
than
your
own
the
strange
thing
is
that
they
should
have
lived
so
thickly
on
what
must
always
have
been
most
unfruitful
soil
am
no
antiquarian
but
could
imagine
that
they
were
some
unwarlike
and
harried
race
who
were
forced
to
accept
that
which
none
other
would
occupy
all
this
however
is
foreign
to
the
mission
on
which
you
sent
me
and
will
probably
be
very
uninteresting
to
your
severely
practical
mind
can
still
remember
your
complete
indifference
as
to
whether
the
sun
moved
round
the
earth
or
the
earth
round
the
sun
let
me
therefore
return
to
the
facts
concerning
sir
henry
baskerville
if
you
have
not
had
any
report
within
the
last
few
days
it
is
because
up
to
day
there
was
nothing
of
importance
to
relate
then
very
surprising
circumstance
occurred
which
shall
tell
you
in
due
course
but
first
of
all
must
keep
you
in
touch
with
some
of
the
other
factors
in
the
situation
one
of
these
concerning
which
have
said
little
is
the
escaped
convict
upon
the
moor
there
is
strong
reason
now
to
believe
that
he
has
got
right
away
which
is
considerable
relief
to
the
lonely
householders
of
this
district
fortnight
has
passed
since
his
flight
during
which
he
has
not
been
seen
and
nothing
has
been
heard
of
him
it
is
surely
inconceivable
that
he
could
have
held
out
upon
the
moor
during
all
that
time
of
course
so
far
as
his
concealment
goes
there
is
no
difficulty
at
all
any
one
of
these
stone
huts
would
give
him
hiding
place
but
there
is
nothing
to
eat
unless
he
were
to
catch
and
slaughter
one
of
the
moor
sheep
we
think
therefore
that
he
has
gone
and
the
outlying
farmers
sleep
the
better
in
consequence
we
are
four
able
bodied
men
in
this
household
so
that
we
could
take
good
care
of
ourselves
but
confess
that
have
had
uneasy
moments
when
have
thought
of
the
stapletons
they
live
miles
from
any
help
there
are
one
maid
an
old
manservant
the
sister
and
the
brother
the
latter
not
very
strong
man
they
would
be
helpless
in
the
hands
of
desperate
fellow
like
this
notting
hill
criminal
if
he
could
once
effect
an
entrance
both
sir
henry
and
were
concerned
at
their
situation
and
it
was
suggested
that
perkins
the
groom
should
go
over
to
sleep
there
but
stapleton
would
not
hear
of
it
the
fact
is
that
our
friend
the
baronet
begins
to
display
considerable
interest
in
our
fair
neighbour
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
for
time
hangs
heavily
in
this
lonely
spot
to
an
active
man
like
him
and
she
is
very
fascinating
and
beautiful
woman
there
is
something
tropical
and
exotic
about
her
which
forms
singular
contrast
to
her
cool
and
unemotional
brother
yet
he
also
gives
the
idea
of
hidden
fires
he
has
certainly
very
marked
influence
over
her
for
have
seen
her
continually
glance
at
him
as
she
talked
as
if
seeking
approbation
for
what
she
said
trust
that
he
is
kind
to
her
there
is
dry
glitter
in
his
eyes
and
firm
set
of
his
thin
lips
which
goes
with
positive
and
possibly
harsh
nature
you
would
find
him
an
interesting
study
he
came
over
to
call
upon
baskerville
on
that
first
day
and
the
very
next
morning
he
took
us
both
to
show
us
the
spot
where
the
legend
of
the
wicked
hugo
is
supposed
to
have
had
its
origin
it
was
an
excursion
of
some
miles
across
the
moor
to
place
which
is
so
dismal
that
it
might
have
suggested
the
story
we
found
short
valley
between
rugged
tors
which
led
to
an
open
grassy
space
flecked
over
with
the
white
cotton
grass
in
the
middle
of
it
rose
two
great
stones
worn
and
sharpened
at
the
upper
end
until
they
looked
like
the
huge
corroding
fangs
of
some
monstrous
beast
in
every
way
it
corresponded
with
the
scene
of
the
old
tragedy
sir
henry
was
much
interested
and
asked
stapleton
more
than
once
whether
he
did
really
believe
in
the
possibility
of
the
interference
of
the
supernatural
in
the
affairs
of
men
he
spoke
lightly
but
it
was
evident
that
he
was
very
much
in
earnest
stapleton
was
guarded
in
his
replies
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
said
less
than
he
might
and
that
he
would
not
express
his
whole
opinion
out
of
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
the
baronet
he
told
us
of
similar
cases
where
families
had
suffered
from
some
evil
influence
and
he
left
us
with
the
impression
that
he
shared
the
popular
view
upon
the
matter

on
our
way
back
we
stayed
for
lunch
at
merripit
house
and
it
was
there
that
sir
henry
made
the
acquaintance
of
miss
stapleton
from
the
first
moment
that
he
saw
her
he
appeared
to
be
strongly
attracted
by
her
and
am
much
mistaken
if
the
feeling
was
not
mutual
he
referred
to
her
again
and
again
on
our
walk
home
and
since
then
hardly
day
has
passed
that
we
have
not
seen
something
of
the
brother
and
sister
they
dine
here
to
night
and
there
is
some
talk
of
our
going
to
them
next
week
one
would
imagine
that
such
match
would
be
very
welcome
to
stapleton
and
yet
have
more
than
once
caught
look
of
the
strongest
disapprobation
in
his
face
when
sir
henry
has
been
paying
some
attention
to
his
sister
he
is
much
attached
to
her
no
doubt
and
would
lead
lonely
life
without
her
but
it
would
seem
the
height
of
selfishness
if
he
were
to
stand
in
the
way
of
her
making
so
brilliant
marriage
yet
am
certain
that
he
does
not
wish
their
intimacy
to
ripen
into
love
and
have
several
times
observed
that
he
has
taken
pains
to
prevent
them
from
being
tête
by
the
way
your
instructions
to
me
never
to
allow
sir
henry
to
go
out
alone
will
become
very
much
more
onerous
if
love
affair
were
to
be
added
to
our
other
difficulties
my
popularity
would
soon
suffer
if
were
to
carry
out
your
orders
to
the
letter
the
other
day
thursday
to
be
more
exact
dr
mortimer
lunched
with
us
he
has
been
excavating
barrow
at
long
down
and
has
got
prehistoric
skull
which
fills
him
with
great
joy
never
was
there
such
single
minded
enthusiast
as
he
the
stapletons
came
in
afterwards
and
the
good
doctor
took
us
all
to
the
yew
alley
at
sir
henry
request
to
show
us
exactly
how
everything
occurred
upon
that
fatal
night
it
is
long
dismal
walk
the
yew
alley
between
two
high
walls
of
clipped
hedge
with
narrow
band
of
grass
upon
either
side
at
the
far
end
is
an
old
tumble
down
summer
house
half
way
down
is
the
moor
gate
where
the
old
gentleman
left
his
cigar
ash
it
is
white
wooden
gate
with
latch
beyond
it
lies
the
wide
moor
remembered
your
theory
of
the
affair
and
tried
to
picture
all
that
had
occurred
as
the
old
man
stood
there
he
saw
something
coming
across
the
moor
something
which
terrified
him
so
that
he
lost
his
wits
and
ran
and
ran
until
he
died
of
sheer
horror
and
exhaustion
there
was
the
long
gloomy
tunnel
down
which
he
fled
and
from
what
sheep
dog
of
the
moor
or
spectral
hound
black
silent
and
monstrous
was
there
human
agency
in
the
matter
did
the
pale
watchful
barrymore
know
more
than
he
cared
to
say
it
was
all
dim
and
vague
but
always
there
is
the
dark
shadow
of
crime
behind
it
one
other
neighbour
have
met
since
wrote
last
this
is
mr
frankland
of
lafter
hall
who
lives
some
four
miles
to
the
south
of
us
he
is
an
elderly
man
red
faced
white
haired
and
choleric
his
passion
is
for
the
british
law
and
he
has
spent
large
fortune
in
litigation
he
fights
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
fighting
and
is
equally
ready
to
take
up
either
side
of
question
so
that
it
is
no
wonder
that
he
has
found
it
costly
amusement
sometimes
he
will
shut
up
right
of
way
and
defy
the
parish
to
make
him
open
it
at
others
he
will
with
his
own
hands
tear
down
some
other
man
gate
and
declare
that
path
has
existed
there
from
time
immemorial
defying
the
owner
to
prosecute
him
for
trespass
he
is
learned
in
old
manorial
and
communal
rights
and
he
applies
his
knowledge
sometimes
in
favour
of
the
villagers
of
fernworthy
and
sometimes
against
them
so
that
he
is
periodically
either
carried
in
triumph
down
the
village
street
or
else
burned
in
effigy
according
to
his
latest
exploit
he
is
said
to
have
about
seven
lawsuits
upon
his
hands
at
present
which
will
probably
swallow
up
the
remainder
of
his
fortune
and
so
draw
his
sting
and
leave
him
harmless
for
the
future
apart
from
the
law
he
seems
kindly
good
natured
person
and
only
mention
him
because
you
were
particular
that
should
send
some
description
of
the
people
who
surround
us
he
is
curiously
employed
at
present
for
being
an
amateur
astronomer
he
has
an
excellent
telescope
with
which
he
lies
upon
the
roof
of
his
own
house
and
sweeps
the
moor
all
day
in
the
hope
of
catching
glimpse
of
the
escaped
convict
if
he
would
confine
his
energies
to
this
all
would
be
well
but
there
are
rumours
that
he
intends
to
prosecute
dr
mortimer
for
opening
grave
without
the
consent
of
the
next
of
kin
because
he
dug
up
the
neolithic
skull
in
the
barrow
on
long
down
he
helps
to
keep
our
lives
from
being
monotonous
and
gives
little
comic
relief
where
it
is
badly
needed
and
now
having
brought
you
up
to
date
in
the
escaped
convict
the
stapletons
dr
mortimer
and
frankland
of
lafter
hall
let
me
end
on
that
which
is
most
important
and
tell
you
more
about
the
barrymores
and
especially
about
the
surprising
development
of
last
night
first
of
all
about
the
test
telegram
which
you
sent
from
london
in
order
to
make
sure
that
barrymore
was
really
here
have
already
explained
that
the
testimony
of
the
postmaster
shows
that
the
test
was
worthless
and
that
we
have
no
proof
one
way
or
the
other
told
sir
henry
how
the
matter
stood
and
he
at
once
in
his
downright
fashion
had
barrymore
up
and
asked
him
whether
he
had
received
the
telegram
himself
barrymore
said
that
he
had
did
the
boy
deliver
it
into
your
own
hands
asked
sir
henry
barrymore
looked
surprised
and
considered
for
little
time
no
said
he
was
in
the
box
room
at
the
time
and
my
wife
brought
it
up
to
me
did
you
answer
it
yourself
no
told
my
wife
what
to
answer
and
she
went
down
to
write
it
in
the
evening
he
recurred
to
the
subject
of
his
own
accord
could
not
quite
understand
the
object
of
your
questions
this
morning
sir
henry
said
he
trust
that
they
do
not
mean
that
have
done
anything
to
forfeit
your
confidence
sir
henry
had
to
assure
him
that
it
was
not
so
and
pacify
him
by
giving
him
considerable
part
of
his
old
wardrobe
the
london
outfit
having
now
all
arrived
mrs
barrymore
is
of
interest
to
me
she
is
heavy
solid
person
very
limited
intensely
respectable
and
inclined
to
be
puritanical
you
could
hardly
conceive
less
emotional
subject
yet
have
told
you
how
on
the
first
night
here
heard
her
sobbing
bitterly
and
since
then
have
more
than
once
observed
traces
of
tears
upon
her
face
some
deep
sorrow
gnaws
ever
at
her
heart
sometimes
wonder
if
she
has
guilty
memory
which
haunts
her
and
sometimes
suspect
barrymore
of
being
domestic
tyrant
have
always
felt
that
there
was
something
singular
and
questionable
in
this
man
character
but
the
adventure
of
last
night
brings
all
my
suspicions
to
head
and
yet
it
may
seem
small
matter
in
itself
you
are
aware
that
am
not
very
sound
sleeper
and
since
have
been
on
guard
in
this
house
my
slumbers
have
been
lighter
than
ever
last
night
about
two
in
the
morning
was
aroused
by
stealthy
step
passing
my
room
rose
opened
my
door
and
peeped
out
long
black
shadow
was
trailing
down
the
corridor
it
was
thrown
by
man
who
walked
softly
down
the
passage
with
candle
held
in
his
hand
he
was
in
shirt
and
trousers
with
no
covering
to
his
feet
could
merely
see
the
outline
but
his
height
told
me
that
it
was
barrymore
he
walked
very
slowly
and
circumspectly
and
there
was
something
indescribably
guilty
and
furtive
in
his
whole
appearance
have
told
you
that
the
corridor
is
broken
by
the
balcony
which
runs
round
the
hall
but
that
it
is
resumed
upon
the
farther
side
waited
until
he
had
passed
out
of
sight
and
then
followed
him
when
came
round
the
balcony
he
had
reached
the
end
of
the
farther
corridor
and
could
see
from
the
glimmer
of
light
through
an
open
door
that
he
had
entered
one
of
the
rooms
now
all
these
rooms
are
unfurnished
and
unoccupied
so
that
his
expedition
became
more
mysterious
than
ever
the
light
shone
steadily
as
if
he
were
standing
motionless
crept
down
the
passage
as
noiselessly
as
could
and
peeped
round
the
corner
of
the
door
barrymore
was
crouching
at
the
window
with
the
candle
held
against
the
glass
his
profile
was
half
turned
towards
me
and
his
face
seemed
to
be
rigid
with
expectation
as
he
stared
out
into
the
blackness
of
the
moor
for
some
minutes
he
stood
watching
intently
then
he
gave
deep
groan
and
with
an
impatient
gesture
he
put
out
the
light
instantly
made
my
way
back
to
my
room
and
very
shortly
came
the
stealthy
steps
passing
once
more
upon
their
return
journey
long
afterwards
when
had
fallen
into
light
sleep
heard
key
turn
somewhere
in
lock
but
could
not
tell
whence
the
sound
came
what
it
all
means
cannot
guess
but
there
is
some
secret
business
going
on
in
this
house
of
gloom
which
sooner
or
later
we
shall
get
to
the
bottom
of
do
not
trouble
you
with
my
theories
for
you
asked
me
to
furnish
you
only
with
facts
have
had
long
talk
with
sir
henry
this
morning
and
we
have
made
plan
of
campaign
founded
upon
my
observations
of
last
night
will
not
speak
about
it
just
now
but
it
should
make
my
next
report
interesting

ix
second
report
of
dr
watson
the
light
upon
the
moor
baskerville
hall
oct
15th
my
dear
holmes
if
was
compelled
to
leave
you
without
much
news
during
the
early
days
of
my
mission
you
must
acknowledge
that
am
making
up
for
lost
time
and
that
events
are
now
crowding
thick
and
fast
upon
us
in
my
last
report
ended
upon
my
top
note
with
barrymore
at
the
window
and
now
have
quite
budget
already
which
will
unless
am
much
mistaken
considerably
surprise
you
things
have
taken
turn
which
could
not
have
anticipated
in
some
ways
they
have
within
the
last
forty
eight
hours
become
much
clearer
and
in
some
ways
they
have
become
more
complicated
but
will
tell
you
all
and
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
before
breakfast
on
the
morning
following
my
adventure
went
down
the
corridor
and
examined
the
room
in
which
barrymore
had
been
on
the
night
before
the
western
window
through
which
he
had
stared
so
intently
has
noticed
one
peculiarity
above
all
other
windows
in
the
house
it
commands
the
nearest
outlook
on
the
moor
there
is
an
opening
between
two
trees
which
enables
one
from
this
point
of
view
to
look
right
down
upon
it
while
from
all
the
other
windows
it
is
only
distant
glimpse
which
can
be
obtained
it
follows
therefore
that
barrymore
since
only
this
window
would
serve
the
purpose
must
have
been
looking
out
for
something
or
somebody
upon
the
moor
the
night
was
very
dark
so
that
can
hardly
imagine
how
he
could
have
hoped
to
see
anyone
it
had
struck
me
that
it
was
possible
that
some
love
intrigue
was
on
foot
that
would
have
accounted
for
his
stealthy
movements
and
also
for
the
uneasiness
of
his
wife
the
man
is
striking
looking
fellow
very
well
equipped
to
steal
the
heart
of
country
girl
so
that
this
theory
seemed
to
have
something
to
support
it
that
opening
of
the
door
which
had
heard
after
had
returned
to
my
room
might
mean
that
he
had
gone
out
to
keep
some
clandestine
appointment
so
reasoned
with
myself
in
the
morning
and
tell
you
the
direction
of
my
suspicions
however
much
the
result
may
have
shown
that
they
were
unfounded
but
whatever
the
true
explanation
of
barrymore
movements
might
be
felt
that
the
responsibility
of
keeping
them
to
myself
until
could
explain
them
was
more
than
could
bear
had
an
interview
with
the
baronet
in
his
study
after
breakfast
and
told
him
all
that
had
seen
he
was
less
surprised
than
had
expected
knew
that
barrymore
walked
about
nights
and
had
mind
to
speak
to
him
about
it
said
he
two
or
three
times
have
heard
his
steps
in
the
passage
coming
and
going
just
about
the
hour
you
name
perhaps
then
he
pays
visit
every
night
to
that
particular
window
suggested
perhaps
he
does
if
so
we
should
be
able
to
shadow
him
and
see
what
it
is
that
he
is
after
wonder
what
your
friend
holmes
would
do
if
he
were
here
believe
that
he
would
do
exactly
what
you
now
suggest
said
he
would
follow
barrymore
and
see
what
he
did
then
we
shall
do
it
together
but
surely
he
would
hear
us
the
man
is
rather
deaf
and
in
any
case
we
must
take
our
chance
of
that
we
ll
sit
up
in
my
room
to
night
and
wait
until
he
passes
sir
henry
rubbed
his
hands
with
pleasure
and
it
was
evident
that
he
hailed
the
adventure
as
relief
to
his
somewhat
quiet
life
upon
the
moor
the
baronet
has
been
in
communication
with
the
architect
who
prepared
the
plans
for
sir
charles
and
with
contractor
from
london
so
that
we
may
expect
great
changes
to
begin
here
soon
there
have
been
decorators
and
furnishers
up
from
plymouth
and
it
is
evident
that
our
friend
has
large
ideas
and
means
to
spare
no
pains
or
expense
to
restore
the
grandeur
of
his
family
when
the
house
is
renovated
and
refurnished
all
that
he
will
need
will
be
wife
to
make
it
complete
between
ourselves
there
are
pretty
clear
signs
that
this
will
not
be
wanting
if
the
lady
is
willing
for
have
seldom
seen
man
more
infatuated
with
woman
than
he
is
with
our
beautiful
neighbour
miss
stapleton
and
yet
the
course
of
true
love
does
not
run
quite
as
smoothly
as
one
would
under
the
circumstances
expect
to
day
for
example
its
surface
was
broken
by
very
unexpected
ripple
which
has
caused
our
friend
considerable
perplexity
and
annoyance
after
the
conversation
which
have
quoted
about
barrymore
sir
henry
put
on
his
hat
and
prepared
to
go
out
as
matter
of
course
did
the
same
what
are
you
coming
watson
he
asked
looking
at
me
in
curious
way
that
depends
on
whether
you
are
going
on
the
moor
said
yes
am
well
you
know
what
my
instructions
are
am
sorry
to
intrude
but
you
heard
how
earnestly
holmes
insisted
that
should
not
leave
you
and
especially
that
you
should
not
go
alone
upon
the
moor
sir
henry
put
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
with
pleasant
smile
my
dear
fellow
said
he
holmes
with
all
his
wisdom
did
not
foresee
some
things
which
have
happened
since
have
been
on
the
moor
you
understand
me
am
sure
that
you
are
the
last
man
in
the
world
who
would
wish
to
be
spoil
sport
must
go
out
alone
it
put
me
in
most
awkward
position
was
at
loss
what
to
say
or
what
to
do
and
before
had
made
up
my
mind
he
picked
up
his
cane
and
was
gone
but
when
came
to
think
the
matter
over
my
conscience
reproached
me
bitterly
for
having
on
any
pretext
allowed
him
to
go
out
of
my
sight
imagined
what
my
feelings
would
be
if
had
to
return
to
you
and
to
confess
that
some
misfortune
had
occurred
through
my
disregard
for
your
instructions
assure
you
my
cheeks
flushed
at
the
very
thought
it
might
not
even
now
be
too
late
to
overtake
him
so
set
off
at
once
in
the
direction
of
merripit
house
hurried
along
the
road
at
the
top
of
my
speed
without
seeing
anything
of
sir
henry
until
came
to
the
point
where
the
moor
path
branches
off
there
fearing
that
perhaps
had
come
in
the
wrong
direction
after
all
mounted
hill
from
which
could
command
view
the
same
hill
which
is
cut
into
the
dark
quarry
thence
saw
him
at
once
he
was
on
the
moor
path
about
quarter
of
mile
off
and
lady
was
by
his
side
who
could
only
be
miss
stapleton
it
was
clear
that
there
was
already
an
understanding
between
them
and
that
they
had
met
by
appointment
they
were
walking
slowly
along
in
deep
conversation
and
saw
her
making
quick
little
movements
of
her
hands
as
if
she
were
very
earnest
in
what
she
was
saying
while
he
listened
intently
and
once
or
twice
shook
his
head
in
strong
dissent
stood
among
the
rocks
watching
them
very
much
puzzled
as
to
what
should
do
next
to
follow
them
and
break
into
their
intimate
conversation
seemed
to
be
an
outrage
and
yet
my
clear
duty
was
never
for
an
instant
to
let
him
out
of
my
sight
to
act
the
spy
upon
friend
was
hateful
task
still
could
see
no
better
course
than
to
observe
him
from
the
hill
and
to
clear
my
conscience
by
confessing
to
him
afterwards
what
had
done
it
is
true
that
if
any
sudden
danger
had
threatened
him
was
too
far
away
to
be
of
use
and
yet
am
sure
that
you
will
agree
with
me
that
the
position
was
very
difficult
and
that
there
was
nothing
more
which
could
do
our
friend
sir
henry
and
the
lady
had
halted
on
the
path
and
were
standing
deeply
absorbed
in
their
conversation
when
was
suddenly
aware
that
was
not
the
only
witness
of
their
interview
wisp
of
green
floating
in
the
air
caught
my
eye
and
another
glance
showed
me
that
it
was
carried
on
stick
by
man
who
was
moving
among
the
broken
ground
it
was
stapleton
with
his
butterfly
net
he
was
very
much
closer
to
the
pair
than
was
and
he
appeared
to
be
moving
in
their
direction
at
this
instant
sir
henry
suddenly
drew
miss
stapleton
to
his
side
his
arm
was
round
her
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
was
straining
away
from
him
with
her
face
averted
he
stooped
his
head
to
hers
and
she
raised
one
hand
as
if
in
protest
next
moment
saw
them
spring
apart
and
turn
hurriedly
round
stapleton
was
the
cause
of
the
interruption
he
was
running
wildly
towards
them
his
absurd
net
dangling
behind
him
he
gesticulated
and
almost
danced
with
excitement
in
front
of
the
lovers
what
the
scene
meant
could
not
imagine
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
stapleton
was
abusing
sir
henry
who
offered
explanations
which
became
more
angry
as
the
other
refused
to
accept
them
the
lady
stood
by
in
haughty
silence
finally
stapleton
turned
upon
his
heel
and
beckoned
in
peremptory
way
to
his
sister
who
after
an
irresolute
glance
at
sir
henry
walked
off
by
the
side
of
her
brother
the
naturalist
angry
gestures
showed
that
the
lady
was
included
in
his
displeasure
the
baronet
stood
for
minute
looking
after
them
and
then
he
walked
slowly
back
the
way
that
he
had
come
his
head
hanging
the
very
picture
of
dejection
what
all
this
meant
could
not
imagine
but
was
deeply
ashamed
to
have
witnessed
so
intimate
scene
without
my
friend
knowledge
ran
down
the
hill
therefore
and
met
the
baronet
at
the
bottom
his
face
was
flushed
with
anger
and
his
brows
were
wrinkled
like
one
who
is
at
his
wit
ends
what
to
do

where
have
you
dropped
from
said
he
you
don
mean
to
say
that
you
came
after
me
in
spite
of
all
explained
everything
to
him
how
had
found
it
impossible
to
remain
behind
how
had
followed
him
and
how
had
witnessed
all
that
had
occurred
for
an
instant
his
eyes
blazed
at
me
but
my
frankness
disarmed
his
anger
and
he
broke
at
last
into
rather
rueful
laugh
you
would
have
thought
the
middle
of
that
prairie
fairly
safe
place
for
man
to
be
private
said
he
but
by
thunder
the
whole
countryside
seems
to
have
been
out
to
see
me
do
my
wooing
and
mighty
poor
wooing
at
that
where
had
you
engaged
seat
was
on
that
hill
quite
in
the
back
row
eh
but
her
brother
was
well
up
to
the
front
did
you
see
him
come
out
on
us
yes
did
he
ever
strike
you
as
being
crazy
this
brother
of
hers
can
say
that
he
ever
did
dare
say
not
always
thought
him
sane
enough
until
to
day
but
you
can
take
it
from
me
that
either
he
or
ought
to
be
in
strait
jacket
what
the
matter
with
me
anyhow
you
ve
lived
near
me
for
some
weeks
watson
tell
me
straight
now
is
there
anything
that
would
prevent
me
from
making
good
husband
to
woman
that
loved
should
say
not
he
can
object
to
my
worldly
position
so
it
must
be
myself
that
he
has
this
down
on
what
has
he
against
me
never
hurt
man
or
woman
in
my
life
that
know
of
and
yet
he
would
not
so
much
as
let
me
touch
the
tips
of
her
fingers
did
he
say
so
that
and
deal
more
tell
you
watson
ve
only
known
her
these
few
weeks
but
from
the
first
just
felt
that
she
was
made
for
me
and
she
too
she
was
happy
when
she
was
with
me
and
that
ll
swear
there
light
in
woman
eyes
that
speaks
louder
than
words
but
he
has
never
let
us
get
together
and
it
was
only
to
day
for
the
first
time
that
saw
chance
of
having
few
words
with
her
alone
she
was
glad
to
meet
me
but
when
she
did
it
was
not
love
that
she
would
talk
about
and
she
wouldn
have
let
me
talk
about
it
either
if
she
could
have
stopped
it
she
kept
coming
back
to
it
that
this
was
place
of
danger
and
that
she
would
never
be
happy
until
had
left
it
told
her
that
since
had
seen
her
was
in
no
hurry
to
leave
it
and
that
if
she
really
wanted
me
to
go
the
only
way
to
work
it
was
for
her
to
arrange
to
go
with
me
with
that
offered
in
as
many
words
to
marry
her
but
before
she
could
answer
down
came
this
brother
of
hers
running
at
us
with
face
on
him
like
madman
he
was
just
white
with
rage
and
those
light
eyes
of
his
were
blazing
with
fury
what
was
doing
with
the
lady
how
dared
offer
her
attentions
which
were
distasteful
to
her
did
think
that
because
was
baronet
could
do
what
liked
if
he
had
not
been
her
brother
should
have
known
better
how
to
answer
him
as
it
was
told
him
that
my
feelings
towards
his
sister
were
such
as
was
not
ashamed
of
and
that
hoped
that
she
might
honour
me
by
becoming
my
wife
that
seemed
to
make
the
matter
no
better
so
then
lost
my
temper
too
and
answered
him
rather
more
hotly
than
should
perhaps
considering
that
she
was
standing
by
so
it
ended
by
his
going
off
with
her
as
you
saw
and
here
am
as
badly
puzzled
man
as
any
in
this
county
just
tell
me
what
it
all
means
watson
and
ll
owe
you
more
than
ever
can
hope
to
pay
tried
one
or
two
explanations
but
indeed
was
completely
puzzled
myself
our
friend
title
his
fortune
his
age
his
character
and
his
appearance
are
all
in
his
favour
and
know
nothing
against
him
unless
it
be
this
dark
fate
which
runs
in
his
family
that
his
advances
should
be
rejected
so
brusquely
without
any
reference
to
the
lady
own
wishes
and
that
the
lady
should
accept
the
situation
without
protest
is
very
amazing
however
our
conjectures
were
set
at
rest
by
visit
from
stapleton
himself
that
very
afternoon
he
had
come
to
offer
apologies
for
his
rudeness
of
the
morning
and
after
long
private
interview
with
sir
henry
in
his
study
the
upshot
of
their
conversation
was
that
the
breach
is
quite
healed
and
that
we
are
to
dine
at
merripit
house
next
friday
as
sign
of
it
don
say
now
that
he
isn
crazy
man
said
sir
henry
can
forget
the
look
in
his
eyes
when
he
ran
at
me
this
morning
but
must
allow
that
no
man
could
make
more
handsome
apology
than
he
has
done
did
he
give
any
explanation
of
his
conduct
his
sister
is
everything
in
his
life
he
says
that
is
natural
enough
and
am
glad
that
he
should
understand
her
value
they
have
always
been
together
and
according
to
his
account
he
has
been
very
lonely
man
with
only
her
as
companion
so
that
the
thought
of
losing
her
was
really
terrible
to
him
he
had
not
understood
he
said
that
was
becoming
attached
to
her
but
when
he
saw
with
his
own
eyes
that
it
was
really
so
and
that
she
might
be
taken
away
from
him
it
gave
him
such
shock
that
for
time
he
was
not
responsible
for
what
he
said
or
did
he
was
very
sorry
for
all
that
had
passed
and
he
recognized
how
foolish
and
how
selfish
it
was
that
he
should
imagine
that
he
could
hold
beautiful
woman
like
his
sister
to
himself
for
her
whole
life
if
she
had
to
leave
him
he
had
rather
it
was
to
neighbour
like
myself
than
to
anyone
else
but
in
any
case
it
was
blow
to
him
and
it
would
take
him
some
time
before
he
could
prepare
himself
to
meet
it
he
would
withdraw
all
opposition
upon
his
part
if
would
promise
for
three
months
to
let
the
matter
rest
and
to
be
content
with
cultivating
the
lady
friendship
during
that
time
without
claiming
her
love
this
promised
and
so
the
matter
rests
so
there
is
one
of
our
small
mysteries
cleared
up
it
is
something
to
have
touched
bottom
anywhere
in
this
bog
in
which
we
are
floundering
we
know
now
why
stapleton
looked
with
disfavour
upon
his
sister
suitor
even
when
that
suitor
was
so
eligible
one
as
sir
henry
and
now
pass
on
to
another
thread
which
have
extricated
out
of
the
tangled
skein
the
mystery
of
the
sobs
in
the
night
of
the
tear
stained
face
of
mrs
barrymore
of
the
secret
journey
of
the
butler
to
the
western
lattice
window
congratulate
me
my
dear
holmes
and
tell
me
that
have
not
disappointed
you
as
an
agent
that
you
do
not
regret
the
confidence
which
you
showed
in
me
when
you
sent
me
down
all
these
things
have
by
one
night
work
been
thoroughly
cleared
have
said
by
one
night
work
but
in
truth
it
was
by
two
nights
work
for
on
the
first
we
drew
entirely
blank
sat
up
with
sir
henry
in
his
rooms
until
nearly
three
clock
in
the
morning
but
no
sound
of
any
sort
did
we
hear
except
the
chiming
clock
upon
the
stairs
it
was
most
melancholy
vigil
and
ended
by
each
of
us
falling
asleep
in
our
chairs
fortunately
we
were
not
discouraged
and
we
determined
to
try
again
the
next
night
we
lowered
the
lamp
and
sat
smoking
cigarettes
without
making
the
least
sound
it
was
incredible
how
slowly
the
hours
crawled
by
and
yet
we
were
helped
through
it
by
the
same
sort
of
patient
interest
which
the
hunter
must
feel
as
he
watches
the
trap
into
which
he
hopes
the
game
may
wander
one
struck
and
two
and
we
had
almost
for
the
second
time
given
it
up
in
despair
when
in
an
instant
we
both
sat
bolt
upright
in
our
chairs
with
all
our
weary
senses
keenly
on
the
alert
once
more
we
had
heard
the
creak
of
step
in
the
passage
very
stealthily
we
heard
it
pass
along
until
it
died
away
in
the
distance
then
the
baronet
gently
opened
his
door
and
we
set
out
in
pursuit
already
our
man
had
gone
round
the
gallery
and
the
corridor
was
all
in
darkness
softly
we
stole
along
until
we
had
come
into
the
other
wing
we
were
just
in
time
to
catch
glimpse
of
the
tall
black
bearded
figure
his
shoulders
rounded
as
he
tip
toed
down
the
passage
then
he
passed
through
the
same
door
as
before
and
the
light
of
the
candle
framed
it
in
the
darkness
and
shot
one
single
yellow
beam
across
the
gloom
of
the
corridor
we
shuffled
cautiously
towards
it
trying
every
plank
before
we
dared
to
put
our
whole
weight
upon
it
we
had
taken
the
precaution
of
leaving
our
boots
behind
us
but
even
so
the
old
boards
snapped
and
creaked
beneath
our
tread
sometimes
it
seemed
impossible
that
he
should
fail
to
hear
our
approach
however
the
man
is
fortunately
rather
deaf
and
he
was
entirely
preoccupied
in
that
which
he
was
doing
when
at
last
we
reached
the
door
and
peeped
through
we
found
him
crouching
at
the
window
candle
in
hand
his
white
intent
face
pressed
against
the
pane
exactly
as
had
seen
him
two
nights
before
we
had
arranged
no
plan
of
campaign
but
the
baronet
is
man
to
whom
the
most
direct
way
is
always
the
most
natural
he
walked
into
the
room
and
as
he
did
so
barrymore
sprang
up
from
the
window
with
sharp
hiss
of
his
breath
and
stood
livid
and
trembling
before
us
his
dark
eyes
glaring
out
of
the
white
mask
of
his
face
were
full
of
horror
and
astonishment
as
he
gazed
from
sir
henry
to
me
what
are
you
doing
here

nothing
sir
his
agitation
was
so
great
that
he
could
hardly
speak
and
the
shadows
sprang
up
and
down
from
the
shaking
of
his
candle
it
was
the
window
sir
go
round
at
night
to
see
that
they
are
fastened
on
the
second
floor
yes
sir
all
the
windows
look
here
barrymore
said
sir
henry
sternly
we
have
made
up
our
minds
to
have
the
truth
out
of
you
so
it
will
save
you
trouble
to
tell
it
sooner
rather
than
later
come
now
no
lies
what
were
you
doing
at
that
window
the
fellow
looked
at
us
in
helpless
way
and
he
wrung
his
hands
together
like
one
who
is
in
the
last
extremity
of
doubt
and
misery
was
doing
no
harm
sir
was
holding
candle
to
the
window
and
why
were
you
holding
candle
to
the
window
don
ask
me
sir
henry
don
ask
me
give
you
my
word
sir
that
it
is
not
my
secret
and
that
cannot
tell
it
if
it
concerned
no
one
but
myself
would
not
try
to
keep
it
from
you
sudden
idea
occurred
to
me
and
took
the
candle
from
the
trembling
hand
of
the
butler
he
must
have
been
holding
it
as
signal
said
let
us
see
if
there
is
any
answer
held
it
as
he
had
done
and
stared
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
vaguely
could
discern
the
black
bank
of
the
trees
and
the
lighter
expanse
of
the
moor
for
the
moon
was
behind
the
clouds
and
then
gave
cry
of
exultation
for
tiny
pin
point
of
yellow
light
had
suddenly
transfixed
the
dark
veil
and
glowed
steadily
in
the
centre
of
the
black
square
framed
by
the
window
there
it
is
cried
no
sir
it
is
nothing
at
all
the
butler
broke
in
assure
you
sir
move
your
light
across
the
window
watson
cried
the
baronet
see
the
other
moves
also
now
you
rascal
do
you
deny
that
it
is
signal
come
speak
up
who
is
your
confederate
out
yonder
and
what
is
this
conspiracy
that
is
going
on
the
man
face
became
openly
defiant
it
is
my
business
and
not
yours
will
not
tell
then
you
leave
my
employment
right
away
very
good
sir
if
must
and
you
go
in
disgrace
by
thunder
you
may
well
be
ashamed
of
yourself
your
family
has
lived
with
mine
for
over
hundred
years
under
this
roof
and
here
find
you
deep
in
some
dark
plot
against
me
no
sir
no
not
against
you
it
was
woman
voice
and
mrs
barrymore
paler
and
more
horror
struck
than
her
husband
was
standing
at
the
door
her
bulky
figure
in
shawl
and
skirt
might
have
been
comic
were
it
not
for
the
intensity
of
feeling
upon
her
face
we
have
to
go
eliza
this
is
the
end
of
it
you
can
pack
our
things
said
the
butler
oh
john
have
brought
you
to
this
it
is
my
doing
sir
henry
all
mine
he
has
done
nothing
except
for
my
sake
and
because
asked
him
speak
out
then
what
does
it
mean
my
unhappy
brother
is
starving
on
the
moor
we
cannot
let
him
perish
at
our
very
gates
the
light
is
signal
to
him
that
food
is
ready
for
him
and
his
light
out
yonder
is
to
show
the
spot
to
which
to
bring
it
then
your
brother
is
the
escaped
convict
sir
selden
the
criminal
that
the
truth
sir
said
barrymore
said
that
it
was
not
my
secret
and
that
could
not
tell
it
to
you
but
now
you
have
heard
it
and
you
will
see
that
if
there
was
plot
it
was
not
against
you
this
then
was
the
explanation
of
the
stealthy
expeditions
at
night
and
the
light
at
the
window
sir
henry
and
both
stared
at
the
woman
in
amazement
was
it
possible
that
this
stolidly
respectable
person
was
of
the
same
blood
as
one
of
the
most
notorious
criminals
in
the
country
yes
sir
my
name
was
selden
and
he
is
my
younger
brother
we
humoured
him
too
much
when
he
was
lad
and
gave
him
his
own
way
in
everything
until
he
came
to
think
that
the
world
was
made
for
his
pleasure
and
that
he
could
do
what
he
liked
in
it
then
as
he
grew
older
he
met
wicked
companions
and
the
devil
entered
into
him
until
he
broke
my
mother
heart
and
dragged
our
name
in
the
dirt
from
crime
to
crime
he
sank
lower
and
lower
until
it
is
only
the
mercy
of
god
which
has
snatched
him
from
the
scaffold
but
to
me
sir
he
was
always
the
little
curly
headed
boy
that
had
nursed
and
played
with
as
an
elder
sister
would
that
was
why
he
broke
prison
sir
he
knew
that
was
here
and
that
we
could
not
refuse
to
help
him
when
he
dragged
himself
here
one
night
weary
and
starving
with
the
warders
hard
at
his
heels
what
could
we
do
we
took
him
in
and
fed
him
and
cared
for
him
then
you
returned
sir
and
my
brother
thought
he
would
be
safer
on
the
moor
than
anywhere
else
until
the
hue
and
cry
was
over
so
he
lay
in
hiding
there
but
every
second
night
we
made
sure
if
he
was
still
there
by
putting
light
in
the
window
and
if
there
was
an
answer
my
husband
took
out
some
bread
and
meat
to
him
every
day
we
hoped
that
he
was
gone
but
as
long
as
he
was
there
we
could
not
desert
him
that
is
the
whole
truth
as
am
an
honest
christian
woman
and
you
will
see
that
if
there
is
blame
in
the
matter
it
does
not
lie
with
my
husband
but
with
me
for
whose
sake
he
has
done
all
that
he
has
the
woman
words
came
with
an
intense
earnestness
which
carried
conviction
with
them
is
this
true
barrymore
yes
sir
henry
every
word
of
it
well
cannot
blame
you
for
standing
by
your
own
wife
forget
what
have
said
go
to
your
room
you
two
and
we
shall
talk
further
about
this
matter
in
the
morning
when
they
were
gone
we
looked
out
of
the
window
again
sir
henry
had
flung
it
open
and
the
cold
night
wind
beat
in
upon
our
faces
far
away
in
the
black
distance
there
still
glowed
that
one
tiny
point
of
yellow
light
wonder
he
dares
said
sir
henry
it
may
be
so
placed
as
to
be
only
visible
from
here
very
likely
how
far
do
you
think
it
is
out
by
the
cleft
tor
think
not
more
than
mile
or
two
off
hardly
that
well
it
cannot
be
far
if
barrymore
had
to
carry
out
the
food
to
it
and
he
is
waiting
this
villain
beside
that
candle
by
thunder
watson
am
going
out
to
take
that
man
the
same
thought
had
crossed
my
own
mind
it
was
not
as
if
the
barrymores
had
taken
us
into
their
confidence
their
secret
had
been
forced
from
them
the
man
was
danger
to
the
community
an
unmitigated
scoundrel
for
whom
there
was
neither
pity
nor
excuse
we
were
only
doing
our
duty
in
taking
this
chance
of
putting
him
back
where
he
could
do
no
harm
with
his
brutal
and
violent
nature
others
would
have
to
pay
the
price
if
we
held
our
hands
any
night
for
example
our
neighbours
the
stapletons
might
be
attacked
by
him
and
it
may
have
been
the
thought
of
this
which
made
sir
henry
so
keen
upon
the
adventure
will
come
said
then
get
your
revolver
and
put
on
your
boots
the
sooner
we
start
the
better
as
the
fellow
may
put
out
his
light
and
be
off
in
five
minutes
we
were
outside
the
door
starting
upon
our
expedition
we
hurried
through
the
dark
shrubbery
amid
the
dull
moaning
of
the
autumn
wind
and
the
rustle
of
the
falling
leaves
the
night
air
was
heavy
with
the
smell
of
damp
and
decay
now
and
again
the
moon
peeped
out
for
an
instant
but
clouds
were
driving
over
the
face
of
the
sky
and
just
as
we
came
out
on
the
moor
thin
rain
began
to
fall
the
light
still
burned
steadily
in
front
are
you
armed
asked
have
hunting
crop
we
must
close
in
on
him
rapidly
for
he
is
said
to
be
desperate
fellow
we
shall
take
him
by
surprise
and
have
him
at
our
mercy
before
he
can
resist
say
watson
said
the
baronet
what
would
holmes
say
to
this
how
about
that
hour
of
darkness
in
which
the
power
of
evil
is
exalted
as
if
in
answer
to
his
words
there
rose
suddenly
out
of
the
vast
gloom
of
the
moor
that
strange
cry
which
had
already
heard
upon
the
borders
of
the
great
grimpen
mire
it
came
with
the
wind
through
the
silence
of
the
night
long
deep
mutter
then
rising
howl
and
then
the
sad
moan
in
which
it
died
away
again
and
again
it
sounded
the
whole
air
throbbing
with
it
strident
wild
and
menacing
the
baronet
caught
my
sleeve
and
his
face
glimmered
white
through
the
darkness
my
god
what
that
watson
don
know
it
sound
they
have
on
the
moor
heard
it
once
before
it
died
away
and
an
absolute
silence
closed
in
upon
us
we
stood
straining
our
ears
but
nothing
came
watson
said
the
baronet
it
was
the
cry
of
hound
my
blood
ran
cold
in
my
veins
for
there
was
break
in
his
voice
which
told
of
the
sudden
horror
which
had
seized
him
what
do
they
call
this
sound
he
asked
who
the
folk
on
the
country
side
oh
they
are
ignorant
people
why
should
you
mind
what
they
call
it
tell
me
watson
what
do
they
say
of
it
hesitated
but
could
not
escape
the
question
страница

they
say
it
is
the
cry
of
the
hound
of
the
baskervilles
he
groaned
and
was
silent
for
few
moments
hound
it
was
he
said
at
last
but
it
seemed
to
come
from
miles
away
over
yonder
think
it
was
hard
to
say
whence
it
came
it
rose
and
fell
with
the
wind
isn
that
the
direction
of
the
great
grimpen
mire
yes
it
is
well
it
was
up
there
come
now
watson
didn
you
think
yourself
that
it
was
the
cry
of
hound
am
not
child
you
need
not
fear
to
speak
the
truth
stapleton
was
with
me
when
heard
it
last
he
said
that
it
might
be
the
calling
of
strange
bird
no
it
was
hound
my
god
can
there
be
some
truth
in
all
these
stories
is
it
possible
that
am
really
in
danger
from
so
dark
cause
you
don
believe
it
do
you
watson
no
and
yet
it
was
one
thing
to
laugh
about
it
in
london
and
it
is
another
to
stand
out
here
in
the
darkness
of
the
moor
and
to
hear
such
cry
as
that
and
my
uncle
there
was
the
footprint
of
the
hound
beside
him
as
he
lay
it
all
fits
together
don
think
that
am
coward
watson
but
that
sound
seemed
to
freeze
my
very
blood
feel
my
hand
it
was
as
cold
as
block
of
marble
you
ll
be
all
right
to
morrow
don
think
ll
get
that
cry
out
of
my
head
what
do
you
advise
that
we
do
now
shall
we
turn
back
no
by
thunder
we
have
come
out
to
get
our
man
and
we
will
do
it
we
after
the
convict
and
hell
hound
as
likely
as
not
after
us
come
on
we
ll
see
it
through
if
all
the
fiends
of
the
pit
were
loose
upon
the
moor
we
stumbled
slowly
along
in
the
darkness
with
the
black
loom
of
the
craggy
hills
around
us
and
the
yellow
speck
of
light
burning
steadily
in
front
there
is
nothing
so
deceptive
as
the
distance
of
light
upon
pitch
dark
night
and
sometimes
the
glimmer
seemed
to
be
far
away
upon
the
horizon
and
sometimes
it
might
have
been
within
few
yards
of
us
but
at
last
we
could
see
whence
it
came
and
then
we
knew
that
we
were
indeed
very
close
guttering
candle
was
stuck
in
crevice
of
the
rocks
which
flanked
it
on
each
side
so
as
to
keep
the
wind
from
it
and
also
to
prevent
it
from
being
visible
save
in
the
direction
of
baskerville
hall
boulder
of
granite
concealed
our
approach
and
crouching
behind
it
we
gazed
over
it
at
the
signal
light
it
was
strange
to
see
this
single
candle
burning
there
in
the
middle
of
the
moor
with
no
sign
of
life
near
it
just
the
one
straight
yellow
flame
and
the
gleam
of
the
rock
on
each
side
of
it
what
shall
we
do
now
whispered
sir
henry
wait
here
he
must
be
near
his
light
let
us
see
if
we
can
get
glimpse
of
him
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
my
mouth
when
we
both
saw
him
over
the
rocks
in
the
crevice
of
which
the
candle
burned
there
was
thrust
out
an
evil
yellow
face
terrible
animal
face
all
seamed
and
scored
with
vile
passions
foul
with
mire
with
bristling
beard
and
hung
with
matted
hair
it
might
well
have
belonged
to
one
of
those
old
savages
who
dwelt
in
the
burrows
on
the
hillsides
the
light
beneath
him
was
reflected
in
his
small
cunning
eyes
which
peered
fiercely
to
right
and
left
through
the
darkness
like
crafty
and
savage
animal
who
has
heard
the
steps
of
the
hunters
something
had
evidently
aroused
his
suspicions
it
may
have
been
that
barrymore
had
some
private
signal
which
we
had
neglected
to
give
or
the
fellow
may
have
had
some
other
reason
for
thinking
that
all
was
not
well
but
could
read
his
fears
upon
his
wicked
face
any
instant
he
might
dash
out
the
light
and
vanish
in
the
darkness
sprang
forward
therefore
and
sir
henry
did
the
same
at
the
same
moment
the
convict
screamed
out
curse
at
us
and
hurled
rock
which
splintered
up
against
the
boulder
which
had
sheltered
us
caught
one
glimpse
of
his
short
squat
strongly
built
figure
as
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
turned
to
run
at
the
same
moment
by
lucky
chance
the
moon
broke
through
the
clouds
we
rushed
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
there
was
our
man
running
with
great
speed
down
the
other
side
springing
over
the
stones
in
his
way
with
the
activity
of
mountain
goat
lucky
long
shot
of
my
revolver
might
have
crippled
him
but
had
brought
it
only
to
defend
myself
if
attacked
and
not
to
shoot
an
unarmed
man
who
was
running
away
we
were
both
swift
runners
and
in
fairly
good
training
but
we
soon
found
that
we
had
no
chance
of
overtaking
him
we
saw
him
for
long
time
in
the
moonlight
until
he
was
only
small
speck
moving
swiftly
among
the
boulders
upon
the
side
of
distant
hill
we
ran
and
ran
until
we
were
completely
blown
but
the
space
between
us
grew
ever
wider
finally
we
stopped
and
sat
panting
on
two
rocks
while
we
watched
him
disappearing
in
the
distance
and
it
was
at
this
moment
that
there
occurred
most
strange
and
unexpected
thing
we
had
risen
from
our
rocks
and
were
turning
to
go
home
having
abandoned
the
hopeless
chase
the
moon
was
low
upon
the
right
and
the
jagged
pinnacle
of
granite
tor
stood
up
against
the
lower
curve
of
its
silver
disc
there
outlined
as
black
as
an
ebony
statue
on
that
shining
background
saw
the
figure
of
man
upon
the
tor
do
not
think
that
it
was
delusion
holmes
assure
you
that
have
never
in
my
life
seen
anything
more
clearly
as
far
as
could
judge
the
figure
was
that
of
tall
thin
man
he
stood
with
his
legs
little
separated
his
arms
folded
his
head
bowed
as
if
he
were
brooding
over
that
enormous
wilderness
of
peat
and
granite
which
lay
before
him
he
might
have
been
the
very
spirit
of
that
terrible
place
it
was
not
the
convict
this
man
was
far
from
the
place
where
the
latter
had
disappeared
besides
he
was
much
taller
man
with
cry
of
surprise
pointed
him
out
to
the
baronet
but
in
the
instant
during
which
had
turned
to
grasp
his
arm
the
man
was
gone
there
was
the
sharp
pinnacle
of
granite
still
cutting
the
lower
edge
of
the
moon
but
its
peak
bore
no
trace
of
that
silent
and
motionless
figure
wished
to
go
in
that
direction
and
to
search
the
tor
but
it
was
some
distance
away
the
baronet
nerves
were
still
quivering
from
that
cry
which
recalled
the
dark
story
of
his
family
and
he
was
not
in
the
mood
for
fresh
adventures
he
had
not
seen
this
lonely
man
upon
the
tor
and
could
not
feel
the
thrill
which
his
strange
presence
and
his
commanding
attitude
had
given
to
me
warder
no
doubt
said
he
the
moor
has
been
thick
with
them
since
this
fellow
escaped
well
perhaps
his
explanation
may
be
the
right
one
but
should
like
to
have
some
further
proof
of
it
to
day
we
mean
to
communicate
to
the
princetown
people
where
they
should
look
for
their
missing
man
but
it
is
hard
lines
that
we
have
not
actually
had
the
triumph
of
bringing
him
back
as
our
own
prisoner
such
are
the
adventures
of
last
night
and
you
must
acknowledge
my
dear
holmes
that
have
done
you
very
well
in
the
matter
of
report
much
of
what
tell
you
is
no
doubt
quite
irrelevant
but
still
feel
that
it
is
best
that
should
let
you
have
all
the
facts
and
leave
you
to
select
for
yourself
those
which
will
be
of
most
service
to
you
in
helping
you
to
your
conclusions
we
are
certainly
making
some
progress
so
far
as
the
barrymores
go
we
have
found
the
motive
of
their
actions
and
that
has
cleared
up
the
situation
very
much
but
the
moor
with
its
mysteries
and
its
strange
inhabitants
remains
as
inscrutable
as
ever
perhaps
in
my
next
may
be
able
to
throw
some
light
upon
this
also
best
of
all
would
it
be
if
you
could
come
down
to
us
in
any
case
you
will
hear
from
me
again
in
the
course
of
the
next
few
days
extract
from
the
diary
of
dr
watson
so
far
have
been
able
to
quote
from
the
reports
which
have
forwarded
during
these
early
days
to
sherlock
holmes
now
however
have
arrived
at
point
in
my
narrative
where
am
compelled
to
abandon
this
method
and
to
trust
once
more
to
my
recollections
aided
by
the
diary
which
kept
at
the
time
few
extracts
from
the
latter
will
carry
me
on
to
those
scenes
which
are
indelibly
fixed
in
every
detail
upon
my
memory
proceed
then
from
the
morning
which
followed
our
abortive
chase
of
the
convict
and
our
other
strange
experiences
upon
the
moor
october
16th
dull
and
foggy
day
with
drizzle
of
rain
the
house
is
banked
in
with
rolling
clouds
which
rise
now
and
then
to
show
the
dreary
curves
of
the
moor
with
thin
silver
veins
upon
the
sides
of
the
hills
and
the
distant
boulders
gleaming
where
the
light
strikes
upon
their
wet
faces
it
is
melancholy
outside
and
in
the
baronet
is
in
black
reaction
after
the
excitements
of
the
night
am
conscious
myself
of
weight
at
my
heart
and
feeling
of
impending
danger
ever
present
danger
which
is
the
more
terrible
because
am
unable
to
define
it
and
have
not
cause
for
such
feeling
consider
the
long
sequence
of
incidents
which
have
all
pointed
to
some
sinister
influence
which
is
at
work
around
us
there
is
the
death
of
the
last
occupant
of
the
hall
fulfilling
so
exactly
the
conditions
of
the
family
legend
and
there
are
the
repeated
reports
from
peasants
of
the
appearance
of
strange
creature
upon
the
moor
twice
have
with
my
own
ears
heard
the
sound
which
resembled
the
distant
baying
of
hound
it
is
incredible
impossible
that
it
should
really
be
outside
the
ordinary
laws
of
nature
spectral
hound
which
leaves
material
footmarks
and
fills
the
air
with
its
howling
is
surely
not
to
be
thought
of
stapleton
may
fall
in
with
such
superstition
and
mortimer
also
but
if
have
one
quality
upon
earth
it
is
common
sense
and
nothing
will
persuade
me
to
believe
in
such
thing
to
do
so
would
be
to
descend
to
the
level
of
these
poor
peasants
who
are
not
content
with
mere
fiend
dog
but
must
needs
describe
him
with
hell
fire
shooting
from
his
mouth
and
eyes
holmes
would
not
listen
to
such
fancies
and
am
his
agent
but
facts
are
facts
and
have
twice
heard
this
crying
upon
the
moor
suppose
that
there
were
really
some
huge
hound
loose
upon
it
that
would
go
far
to
explain
everything
but
where
could
such
hound
lie
concealed
where
did
it
get
its
food
where
did
it
come
from
how
was
it
that
no
one
saw
it
by
day
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
natural
explanation
offers
almost
as
many
difficulties
as
the
other
and
always
apart
from
the
hound
there
is
the
fact
of
the
human
agency
in
london
the
man
in
the
cab
and
the
letter
which
warned
sir
henry
against
the
moor
this
at
least
was
real
but
it
might
have
been
the
work
of
protecting
friend
as
easily
as
of
an
enemy
where
is
that
friend
or
enemy
now
has
he
remained
in
london
or
has
he
followed
us
down
here
could
he
could
he
be
the
stranger
whom
saw
upon
the
tor

it
is
true
that
have
had
only
the
one
glance
at
him
and
yet
there
are
some
things
to
which
am
ready
to
swear
he
is
no
one
whom
have
seen
down
here
and
have
now
met
all
the
neighbours
the
figure
was
far
taller
than
that
of
stapleton
far
thinner
than
that
of
frankland
barrymore
it
might
possibly
have
been
but
we
had
left
him
behind
us
and
am
certain
that
he
could
not
have
followed
us
stranger
then
is
still
dogging
us
just
as
stranger
dogged
us
in
london
we
have
never
shaken
him
off
if
could
lay
my
hands
upon
that
man
then
at
last
we
might
find
ourselves
at
the
end
of
all
our
difficulties
to
this
one
purpose
must
now
devote
all
my
energies
my
first
impulse
was
to
tell
sir
henry
all
my
plans
my
second
and
wisest
one
is
to
play
my
own
game
and
speak
as
little
as
possible
to
anyone
he
is
silent
and
distrait
his
nerves
have
been
strangely
shaken
by
that
sound
upon
the
moor
will
say
nothing
to
add
to
his
anxieties
but
will
take
my
own
steps
to
attain
my
own
end
we
had
small
scene
this
morning
after
breakfast
barrymore
asked
leave
to
speak
with
sir
henry
and
they
were
closeted
in
his
study
some
little
time
sitting
in
the
billiard
room
more
than
once
heard
the
sound
of
voices
raised
and
had
pretty
good
idea
what
the
point
was
which
was
under
discussion
after
time
the
baronet
opened
his
door
and
called
for
me
barrymore
considers
that
he
has
grievance
he
said
he
thinks
that
it
was
unfair
on
our
part
to
hunt
his
brother
in
law
down
when
he
of
his
own
free
will
had
told
us
the
secret
the
butler
was
standing
very
pale
but
very
collected
before
us
may
have
spoken
too
warmly
sir
said
he
and
if
have
am
sure
that
beg
your
pardon
at
the
same
time
was
very
much
surprised
when
heard
you
two
gentlemen
come
back
this
morning
and
learned
that
you
had
been
chasing
selden
the
poor
fellow
has
enough
to
fight
against
without
my
putting
more
upon
his
track
if
you
had
told
us
of
your
own
free
will
it
would
have
been
different
thing
said
the
baronet
you
only
told
us
or
rather
your
wife
only
told
us
when
it
was
forced
from
you
and
you
could
not
help
yourself
didn
think
you
would
have
taken
advantage
of
it
sir
henry
indeed
didn
the
man
is
public
danger
there
are
lonely
houses
scattered
over
the
moor
and
he
is
fellow
who
would
stick
at
nothing
you
only
want
to
get
glimpse
of
his
face
to
see
that
look
at
mr
stapleton
house
for
example
with
no
one
but
himself
to
defend
it
there
no
safety
for
anyone
until
he
is
under
lock
and
key
he
ll
break
into
no
house
sir
give
you
my
solemn
word
upon
that
but
he
will
never
trouble
anyone
in
this
country
again
assure
you
sir
henry
that
in
very
few
days
the
necessary
arrangements
will
have
been
made
and
he
will
be
on
his
way
to
south
america
for
god
sake
sir
beg
of
you
not
to
let
the
police
know
that
he
is
still
on
the
moor
they
have
given
up
the
chase
there
and
he
can
lie
quiet
until
the
ship
is
ready
for
him
you
can
tell
on
him
without
getting
my
wife
and
me
into
trouble
beg
you
sir
to
say
nothing
to
the
police
what
do
you
say
watson
shrugged
my
shoulders
if
he
were
safely
out
of
the
country
it
would
relieve
the
taxpayer
of
burden
but
how
about
the
chance
of
his
holding
someone
up
before
he
goes
he
would
not
do
anything
so
mad
sir
we
have
provided
him
with
all
that
he
can
want
to
commit
crime
would
be
to
show
where
he
was
hiding
that
is
true
said
sir
henry
well
barrymore
god
bless
you
sir
and
thank
you
from
my
heart
it
would
have
killed
my
poor
wife
had
he
been
taken
again
guess
we
are
aiding
and
abetting
felony
watson
but
after
what
we
have
heard
don
feel
as
if
could
give
the
man
up
so
there
is
an
end
of
it
all
right
barrymore
you
can
go
with
few
broken
words
of
gratitude
the
man
turned
but
he
hesitated
and
then
came
back
you
ve
been
so
kind
to
us
sir
that
should
like
to
do
the
best
can
for
you
in
return
know
something
sir
henry
and
perhaps
should
have
said
it
before
but
it
was
long
after
the
inquest
that
found
it
out
ve
never
breathed
word
about
it
yet
to
mortal
man
it
about
poor
sir
charles
death
the
baronet
and
were
both
upon
our
feet
do
you
know
how
he
died
no
sir
don
know
that
what
then
know
why
he
was
at
the
gate
at
that
hour
it
was
to
meet
woman
to
meet
woman
he
yes
sir
and
the
woman
name
can
give
you
the
name
sir
but
can
give
you
the
initials
her
initials
were
how
do
you
know
this
barrymore
well
sir
henry
your
uncle
had
letter
that
morning
he
had
usually
great
many
letters
for
he
was
public
man
and
well
known
for
his
kind
heart
so
that
everyone
who
was
in
trouble
was
glad
to
turn
to
him
but
that
morning
as
it
chanced
there
was
only
this
one
letter
so
took
the
more
notice
of
it
was
from
coombe
tracey
and
it
was
addressed
in
woman
hand
well
sir
thought
no
more
of
the
matter
and
never
would
have
done
had
it
not
been
for
my
wife
only
few
weeks
ago
she
was
cleaning
out
sir
charles
study
it
had
never
been
touched
since
his
death
and
she
found
the
ashes
of
burned
letter
in
the
back
of
the
grate
the
greater
part
of
it
was
charred
to
pieces
but
one
little
slip
the
end
of
page
hung
together
and
the
writing
could
still
be
read
though
it
was
grey
on
black
ground
it
seemed
to
us
to
be
postscript
at
the
end
of
the
letter
and
it
said
please
as
you
are
gentleman
burn
this
letter
and
be
at
the
gate
by
ten
clock
beneath
it
were
signed
the
initials
have
you
got
that
slip
no
sir
it
crumbled
all
to
bits
after
we
moved
it
had
sir
charles
received
any
other
letters
in
the
same
writing
well
sir
took
no
particular
notice
of
his
letters
should
not
have
noticed
this
one
only
it
happened
to
come
alone
and
you
have
no
idea
who
is
no
sir
no
more
than
you
have
but
expect
if
we
could
lay
our
hands
upon
that
lady
we
should
know
more
about
sir
charles
death
cannot
understand
barrymore
how
you
came
to
conceal
this
important
information
well
sir
it
was
immediately
after
that
our
own
trouble
came
to
us
and
then
again
sir
we
were
both
of
us
very
fond
of
sir
charles
as
we
well
might
be
considering
all
that
he
has
done
for
us
to
rake
this
up
couldn
help
our
poor
master
and
it
well
to
go
carefully
when
there
lady
in
the
case
even
the
best
of
us
you
thought
it
might
injure
his
reputation
well
sir
thought
no
good
could
come
of
it
but
now
you
have
been
kind
to
us
and
feel
as
if
it
would
be
treating
you
unfairly
not
to
tell
you
all
that
know
about
the
matter
very
good
barrymore
you
can
go
when
the
butler
had
left
us
sir
henry
turned
to
me
well
watson
what
do
you
think
of
this
new
light
it
seems
to
leave
the
darkness
rather
blacker
than
before
so
think
but
if
we
can
only
trace
it
should
clear
up
the
whole
business
we
have
gained
that
much
we
know
that
there
is
someone
who
has
the
facts
if
we
can
only
find
her
what
do
you
think
we
should
do
let
holmes
know
all
about
it
at
once
it
will
give
him
the
clue
for
which
he
has
been
seeking
am
much
mistaken
if
it
does
not
bring
him
down
went
at
once
to
my
room
and
drew
up
my
report
of
the
morning
conversation
for
holmes
it
was
evident
to
me
that
he
had
been
very
busy
of
late
for
the
notes
which
had
from
baker
street
were
few
and
short
with
no
comments
upon
the
information
which
had
supplied
and
hardly
any
reference
to
my
mission
no
doubt
his
blackmailing
case
is
absorbing
all
his
faculties
and
yet
this
new
factor
must
surely
arrest
his
attention
and
renew
his
interest
wish
that
he
were
here
october
17th
all
day
to
day
the
rain
poured
down
rustling
on
the
ivy
and
dripping
from
the
eaves
thought
of
the
convict
out
upon
the
bleak
cold
shelterless
moor
poor
devil
whatever
his
crimes
he
has
suffered
something
to
atone
for
them
and
then
thought
of
that
other
one
the
face
in
the
cab
the
figure
against
the
moon
was
he
also
out
in
that
deluge
the
unseen
watcher
the
man
of
darkness
in
the
evening
put
on
my
waterproof
and
walked
far
upon
the
sodden
moor
full
of
dark
imaginings
the
rain
beating
upon
my
face
and
the
wind
whistling
about
my
ears
god
help
those
who
wander
into
the
great
mire
now
for
even
the
firm
uplands
are
becoming
morass
found
the
black
tor
upon
which
had
seen
the
solitary
watcher
and
from
its
craggy
summit
looked
out
myself
across
the
melancholy
downs
rain
squalls
drifted
across
their
russet
face
and
the
heavy
slate
coloured
clouds
hung
low

as
walked
back
was
overtaken
by
dr
mortimer
driving
in
his
dog
cart
over
rough
moorland
track
which
led
from
the
outlying
farmhouse
of
foulmire
he
has
been
very
attentive
to
us
and
hardly
day
has
passed
that
he
has
not
called
at
the
hall
to
see
how
we
were
getting
on
he
insisted
upon
my
climbing
into
his
dog
cart
and
he
gave
me
lift
homeward
found
him
much
troubled
over
the
disappearance
of
his
little
spaniel
it
had
wandered
on
to
the
moor
and
had
never
come
back
gave
him
such
consolation
as
might
but
thought
of
the
pony
on
the
grimpen
mire
and
do
not
fancy
that
he
will
see
his
little
dog
again
by
the
way
mortimer
said
as
we
jolted
along
the
rough
road
suppose
there
are
few
people
living
within
driving
distance
of
this
whom
you
do
not
know
hardly
any
think
can
you
then
tell
me
the
name
of
any
woman
whose
initials
are
he
thought
for
few
minutes
no
said
he
there
are
few
gipsies
and
labouring
folk
for
whom
can
answer
but
among
the
farmers
or
gentry
there
is
no
one
whose
initials
are
those
wait
bit
though
he
added
after
pause
there
is
laura
lyons
her
initials
are
but
she
lives
in
coombe
tracey
who
is
she
asked
she
is
frankland
daughter
what
old
frankland
the
crank
exactly
she
married
an
artist
named
lyons
who
came
sketching
on
the
moor
he
proved
to
be
blackguard
and
deserted
her
the
fault
from
what
hear
may
not
have
been
entirely
on
one
side
her
father
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
her
because
she
had
married
without
his
consent
and
perhaps
for
one
or
two
other
reasons
as
well
so
between
the
old
sinner
and
the
young
one
the
girl
has
had
pretty
bad
time
how
does
she
live
fancy
old
frankland
allows
her
pittance
but
it
cannot
be
more
for
his
own
affairs
are
considerably
involved
whatever
she
may
have
deserved
one
could
not
allow
her
to
go
hopelessly
to
the
bad
her
story
got
about
and
several
of
the
people
here
did
something
to
enable
her
to
earn
an
honest
living
stapleton
did
for
one
and
sir
charles
for
another
gave
trifle
myself
it
was
to
set
her
up
in
typewriting
business
he
wanted
to
know
the
object
of
my
inquiries
but
managed
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
without
telling
him
too
much
for
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
take
anyone
into
our
confidence
to
morrow
morning
shall
find
my
way
to
coombe
tracey
and
if
can
see
this
mrs
laura
lyons
of
equivocal
reputation
long
step
will
have
been
made
towards
clearing
one
incident
in
this
chain
of
mysteries
am
certainly
developing
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
for
when
mortimer
pressed
his
questions
to
an
inconvenient
extent
asked
him
casually
to
what
type
frankland
skull
belonged
and
so
heard
nothing
but
craniology
for
the
rest
of
our
drive
have
not
lived
for
years
with
sherlock
holmes
for
nothing
have
only
one
other
incident
to
record
upon
this
tempestuous
and
melancholy
day
this
was
my
conversation
with
barrymore
just
now
which
gives
me
one
more
strong
card
which
can
play
in
due
time
mortimer
had
stayed
to
dinner
and
he
and
the
baronet
played
écarté
afterwards
the
butler
brought
me
my
coffee
into
the
library
and
took
the
chance
to
ask
him
few
questions
well
said
has
this
precious
relation
of
yours
departed
or
is
he
still
lurking
out
yonder
don
know
sir
hope
to
heaven
that
he
has
gone
for
he
has
brought
nothing
but
trouble
here
ve
not
heard
of
him
since
left
out
food
for
him
last
and
that
was
three
days
ago
did
you
see
him
then
no
sir
but
the
food
was
gone
when
next
went
that
way
then
he
was
certainly
there
so
you
would
think
sir
unless
it
was
the
other
man
who
took
it
sat
with
my
coffee
cup
halfway
to
my
lips
and
stared
at
barrymore
you
know
that
there
is
another
man
then
yes
sir
there
is
another
man
upon
the
moor
have
you
seen
him
no
sir
how
do
you
know
of
him
then
selden
told
me
of
him
sir
week
ago
or
more
he
in
hiding
too
but
he
not
convict
as
far
as
can
make
out
don
like
it
dr
watson
tell
you
straight
sir
that
don
like
it
he
spoke
with
sudden
passion
of
earnestness
now
listen
to
me
barrymore
have
no
interest
in
this
matter
but
that
of
your
master
have
come
here
with
no
object
except
to
help
him
tell
me
frankly
what
it
is
that
you
don
like
barrymore
hesitated
for
moment
as
if
he
regretted
his
outburst
or
found
it
difficult
to
express
his
own
feelings
in
words
it
all
these
goings
on
sir
he
cried
at
last
waving
his
hand
towards
the
rain
lashed
window
which
faced
the
moor
there
foul
play
somewhere
and
there
black
villainy
brewing
to
that
ll
swear
very
glad
should
be
sir
to
see
sir
henry
on
his
way
back
to
london
again
but
what
is
it
that
alarms
you
look
at
sir
charles
death
that
was
bad
enough
for
all
that
the
coroner
said
look
at
the
noises
on
the
moor
at
night
there
not
man
would
cross
it
after
sundown
if
he
was
paid
for
it
look
at
this
stranger
hiding
out
yonder
and
watching
and
waiting
what
he
waiting
for
what
does
it
mean
it
means
no
good
to
anyone
of
the
name
of
baskerville
and
very
glad
shall
be
to
be
quit
of
it
all
on
the
day
that
sir
henry
new
servants
are
ready
to
take
over
the
hall
but
about
this
stranger
said
can
you
tell
me
anything
about
him
what
did
selden
say
did
he
find
out
where
he
hid
or
what
he
was
doing
he
saw
him
once
or
twice
but
he
is
deep
one
and
gives
nothing
away
at
first
he
thought
that
he
was
the
police
but
soon
he
found
that
he
had
some
lay
of
his
own
kind
of
gentleman
he
was
as
far
as
he
could
see
but
what
he
was
doing
he
could
not
make
out
and
where
did
he
say
that
he
lived
among
the
old
houses
on
the
hillside
the
stone
huts
where
the
old
folk
used
to
live
but
how
about
his
food
selden
found
out
that
he
has
got
lad
who
works
for
him
and
brings
him
all
he
needs
daresay
he
goes
to
coombe
tracey
for
what
he
wants
very
good
barrymore
we
may
talk
further
of
this
some
other
time
when
the
butler
had
gone
walked
over
to
the
black
window
and
looked
through
blurred
pane
at
the
driving
clouds
and
at
the
tossing
outline
of
the
wind
swept
trees
it
is
wild
night
indoors
and
what
must
it
be
in
stone
hut
upon
the
moor
what
passion
of
hatred
can
it
be
which
leads
man
to
lurk
in
such
place
at
such
time
and
what
deep
and
earnest
purpose
can
he
have
which
calls
for
such
trial
there
in
that
hut
upon
the
moor
seems
to
lie
the
very
centre
of
that
problem
which
has
vexed
me
so
sorely
swear
that
another
day
shall
not
have
passed
before
have
done
all
that
man
can
do
to
reach
the
heart
of
the
mystery
xi
the
man
on
the
tor
the
extract
from
my
private
diary
which
forms
the
last
chapter
has
brought
my
narrative
up
to
the
18th
of
october
time
when
these
strange
events
began
to
move
swiftly
towards
their
terrible
conclusion
the
incidents
of
the
next
few
days
are
indelibly
graven
upon
my
recollection
and
can
tell
them
without
reference
to
the
notes
made
at
the
time
start
then
from
the
day
which
succeeded
that
upon
which
had
established
two
facts
of
great
importance
the
one
that
mrs
laura
lyons
of
coombe
tracey
had
written
to
sir
charles
baskerville
and
made
an
appointment
with
him
at
the
very
place
and
hour
that
he
met
his
death
the
other
that
the
lurking
man
upon
the
moor
was
to
be
found
among
the
stone
huts
upon
the
hill
side
with
these
two
facts
in
my
possession
felt
that
either
my
intelligence
or
my
courage
must
be
deficient
if
could
not
throw
some
further
light
upon
these
dark
places
had
no
opportunity
to
tell
the
baronet
what
had
learned
about
mrs
lyons
upon
the
evening
before
for
dr
mortimer
remained
with
him
at
cards
until
it
was
very
late
at
breakfast
however
informed
him
about
my
discovery
and
asked
him
whether
he
would
care
to
accompany
me
to
coombe
tracey
at
first
he
was
very
eager
to
come
but
on
second
thoughts
it
seemed
to
both
of
us
that
if
went
alone
the
results
might
be
better
the
more
formal
we
made
the
visit
the
less
information
we
might
obtain
left
sir
henry
behind
therefore
not
without
some
prickings
of
conscience
and
drove
off
upon
my
new
quest
when
reached
coombe
tracey
told
perkins
to
put
up
the
horses
and
made
inquiries
for
the
lady
whom
had
come
to
interrogate
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
her
rooms
which
were
central
and
well
appointed
maid
showed
me
in
without
ceremony
and
as
entered
the
sitting
room
lady
who
was
sitting
before
remington
typewriter
sprang
up
with
pleasant
smile
of
welcome
her
face
fell
however
when
she
saw
that
was
stranger
and
she
sat
down
again
and
asked
me
the
object
of
my
visit

the
first
impression
left
by
mrs
lyons
was
one
of
extreme
beauty
her
eyes
and
hair
were
of
the
same
rich
hazel
colour
and
her
cheeks
though
considerably
freckled
were
flushed
with
the
exquisite
bloom
of
the
brunette
the
dainty
pink
which
lurks
at
the
heart
of
the
sulphur
rose
admiration
was
repeat
the
first
impression
but
the
second
was
criticism
there
was
something
subtly
wrong
with
the
face
some
coarseness
of
expression
some
hardness
perhaps
of
eye
some
looseness
of
lip
which
marred
its
perfect
beauty
but
these
of
course
are
after
thoughts
at
the
moment
was
simply
conscious
that
was
in
the
presence
of
very
handsome
woman
and
that
she
was
asking
me
the
reasons
for
my
visit
had
not
quite
understood
until
that
instant
how
delicate
my
mission
was
have
the
pleasure
said
of
knowing
your
father
it
was
clumsy
introduction
and
the
lady
made
me
feel
it
there
is
nothing
in
common
between
my
father
and
me
she
said
owe
him
nothing
and
his
friends
are
not
mine
if
it
were
not
for
the
late
sir
charles
baskerville
and
some
other
kind
hearts
might
have
starved
for
all
that
my
father
cared
it
was
about
the
late
sir
charles
baskerville
that
have
come
here
to
see
you
the
freckles
started
out
on
the
lady
face
what
can
tell
you
about
him
she
asked
and
her
fingers
played
nervously
over
the
stops
of
her
typewriter
you
knew
him
did
you
not
have
already
said
that
owe
great
deal
to
his
kindness
if
am
able
to
support
myself
it
is
largely
due
to
the
interest
which
he
took
in
my
unhappy
situation
did
you
correspond
with
him
the
lady
looked
quickly
up
with
an
angry
gleam
in
her
hazel
eyes
what
is
the
object
of
these
questions
she
asked
sharply
the
object
is
to
avoid
public
scandal
it
is
better
that
should
ask
them
here
than
that
the
matter
should
pass
outside
our
control
she
was
silent
and
her
face
was
still
very
pale
at
last
she
looked
up
with
something
reckless
and
defiant
in
her
manner
well
ll
answer
she
said
what
are
your
questions
did
you
correspond
with
sir
charles
certainly
wrote
to
him
once
or
twice
to
acknowledge
his
delicacy
and
his
generosity
have
you
the
dates
of
those
letters
no
have
you
ever
met
him
yes
once
or
twice
when
he
came
into
coombe
tracey
he
was
very
retiring
man
and
he
preferred
to
do
good
by
stealth
but
if
you
saw
him
so
seldom
and
wrote
so
seldom
how
did
he
know
enough
about
your
affairs
to
be
able
to
help
you
as
you
say
that
he
has
done
she
met
my
difficulty
with
the
utmost
readiness
there
were
several
gentlemen
who
knew
my
sad
history
and
united
to
help
me
one
was
mr
stapleton
neighbour
and
intimate
friend
of
sir
charles
he
was
exceedingly
kind
and
it
was
through
him
that
sir
charles
learned
about
my
affairs
knew
already
that
sir
charles
baskerville
had
made
stapleton
his
almoner
upon
several
occasions
so
the
lady
statement
bore
the
impress
of
truth
upon
it
did
you
ever
write
to
sir
charles
asking
him
to
meet
you
continued
mrs
lyons
flushed
with
anger
again
really
sir
this
is
very
extraordinary
question
am
sorry
madam
but
must
repeat
it
then
answer
certainly
not
on
the
very
day
of
sir
charles
death
the
flush
had
faded
in
an
instant
and
deathly
face
was
before
me
her
dry
lips
could
not
speak
the
no
which
saw
rather
than
heard
surely
your
memory
deceives
you
said
could
even
quote
passage
of
your
letter
it
ran
please
as
you
are
gentleman
burn
this
letter
and
be
at
the
gate
by
ten
clock
thought
that
she
had
fainted
but
she
recovered
herself
by
supreme
effort
is
there
no
such
thing
as
gentleman
she
gasped
you
do
sir
charles
an
injustice
he
did
burn
the
letter
but
sometimes
letter
may
be
legible
even
when
burned
you
acknowledge
now
that
you
wrote
it
yes
did
write
it
she
cried
pouring
out
her
soul
in
torrent
of
words
did
write
it
why
should
deny
it
have
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
it
wished
him
to
help
me
believed
that
if
had
an
interview
could
gain
his
help
so
asked
him
to
meet
me
but
why
at
such
an
hour
because
had
only
just
learned
that
he
was
going
to
london
next
day
and
might
be
away
for
months
there
were
reasons
why
could
not
get
there
earlier
but
why
rendezvous
in
the
garden
instead
of
visit
to
the
house
do
you
think
woman
could
go
alone
at
that
hour
to
bachelor
house
well
what
happened
when
you
did
get
there
never
went
mrs
lyons
no
swear
it
to
you
on
all
hold
sacred
never
went
something
intervened
to
prevent
my
going
what
was
that
is
private
matter
cannot
tell
it
you
acknowledge
then
that
you
made
an
appointment
with
sir
charles
at
the
very
hour
and
place
at
which
he
met
his
death
but
you
deny
that
you
kept
the
appointment
that
is
the
truth
again
and
again
cross
questioned
her
but
could
never
get
past
that
point
mrs
lyons
said
as
rose
from
this
long
and
inconclusive
interview
you
are
taking
very
great
responsibility
and
putting
yourself
in
very
false
position
by
not
making
an
absolutely
clean
breast
of
all
that
you
know
if
have
to
call
in
the
aid
of
the
police
you
will
find
how
seriously
you
are
compromised
if
your
position
is
innocent
why
did
you
in
the
first
instance
deny
having
written
to
sir
charles
upon
that
date
because
feared
that
some
false
conclusion
might
be
drawn
from
it
and
that
might
find
myself
involved
in
scandal
and
why
were
you
so
pressing
that
sir
charles
should
destroy
your
letter
if
you
have
read
the
letter
you
will
know
did
not
say
that
had
read
all
the
letter
you
quoted
some
of
it
quoted
the
postscript
the
letter
had
as
said
been
burned
and
it
was
not
all
legible
ask
you
once
again
why
it
was
that
you
were
so
pressing
that
sir
charles
should
destroy
this
letter
which
he
received
on
the
day
of
his
death
the
matter
is
very
private
one
the
more
reason
why
you
should
avoid
public
investigation
will
tell
you
then
if
you
have
heard
anything
of
my
unhappy
history
you
will
know
that
made
rash
marriage
and
had
reason
to
regret
it
have
heard
so
much
my
life
has
been
one
incessant
persecution
from
husband
whom
abhor
the
law
is
upon
his
side
and
every
day
am
faced
by
the
possibility
that
he
may
force
me
to
live
with
him
at
the
time
that
wrote
this
letter
to
sir
charles
had
learned
that
there
was
prospect
of
my
regaining
my
freedom
if
certain
expenses
could
be
met
it
meant
everything
to
me
peace
of
mind
happiness
self
respect
everything
knew
sir
charles
generosity
and
thought
that
if
he
heard
the
story
from
my
own
lips
he
would
help
me
then
how
is
it
that
you
did
not
go
because
received
help
in
the
interval
from
another
source
why
then
did
you
not
write
to
sir
charles
and
explain
this
so
should
have
done
had
not
seen
his
death
in
the
paper
next
morning
the
woman
story
hung
coherently
together
and
all
my
questions
were
unable
to
shake
it
could
only
check
it
by
finding
if
she
had
indeed
instituted
divorce
proceedings
against
her
husband
at
or
about
the
time
of
the
tragedy
it
was
unlikely
that
she
would
dare
to
say
that
she
had
not
been
to
baskerville
hall
if
she
really
had
been
for
trap
would
be
necessary
to
take
her
there
and
could
not
have
returned
to
coombe
tracey
until
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
such
an
excursion
could
not
be
kept
secret
the
probability
was
therefore
that
she
was
telling
the
truth
or
at
least
part
of
the
truth
came
away
baffled
and
disheartened
once
again
had
reached
that
dead
wall
which
seemed
to
be
built
across
every
path
by
which
tried
to
get
at
the
object
of
my
mission
and
yet
the
more
thought
of
the
lady
face
and
of
her
manner
the
more
felt
that
something
was
being
held
back
from
me
why
should
she
turn
so
pale
why
should
she
fight
against
every
admission
until
it
was
forced
from
her
why
should
she
have
been
so
reticent
at
the
time
of
the
tragedy
surely
the
explanation
of
all
this
could
not
be
as
innocent
as
she
would
have
me
believe
for
the
moment
could
proceed
no
farther
in
that
direction
but
must
turn
back
to
that
other
clue
which
was
to
be
sought
for
among
the
stone
huts
upon
the
moor
and
that
was
most
vague
direction
realized
it
as
drove
back
and
noted
how
hill
after
hill
showed
traces
of
the
ancient
people
barrymore
only
indication
had
been
that
the
stranger
lived
in
one
of
these
abandoned
huts
and
many
hundreds
of
them
are
scattered
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
moor
but
had
my
own
experience
for
guide
since
it
had
shown
me
the
man
himself
standing
upon
the
summit
of
the
black
tor
that
then
should
be
the
centre
of
my
search
from
there
should
explore
every
hut
upon
the
moor
until
lighted
upon
the
right
one
if
this
man
were
inside
it
should
find
out
from
his
own
lips
at
the
point
of
my
revolver
if
necessary
who
he
was
and
why
he
had
dogged
us
so
long
he
might
slip
away
from
us
in
the
crowd
of
regent
street
but
it
would
puzzle
him
to
do
so
upon
the
lonely
moor
on
the
other
hand
if
should
find
the
hut
and
its
tenant
should
not
be
within
it
must
remain
there
however
long
the
vigil
until
he
returned
holmes
had
missed
him
in
london
it
would
indeed
be
triumph
for
me
if
could
run
him
to
earth
where
my
master
had
failed

luck
had
been
against
us
again
and
again
in
this
inquiry
but
now
at
last
it
came
to
my
aid
and
the
messenger
of
good
fortune
was
none
other
than
mr
frankland
who
was
standing
grey
whiskered
and
red
faced
outside
the
gate
of
his
garden
which
opened
on
to
the
high
road
along
which
travelled
good
day
dr
watson
cried
he
with
unwonted
good
humour
you
must
really
give
your
horses
rest
and
come
in
to
have
glass
of
wine
and
to
congratulate
me
my
feelings
towards
him
were
very
far
from
being
friendly
after
what
had
heard
of
his
treatment
of
his
daughter
but
was
anxious
to
send
perkins
and
the
wagonette
home
and
the
opportunity
was
good
one
alighted
and
sent
message
to
sir
henry
that
should
walk
over
in
time
for
dinner
then
followed
frankland
into
his
dining
room
it
is
great
day
for
me
sir
one
of
the
red
letter
days
of
my
life
he
cried
with
many
chuckles
have
brought
off
double
event
mean
to
teach
them
in
these
parts
that
law
is
law
and
that
there
is
man
here
who
does
not
fear
to
invoke
it
have
established
right
of
way
through
the
centre
of
old
middleton
park
slap
across
it
sir
within
hundred
yards
of
his
own
front
door
what
do
you
think
of
that
we
ll
teach
these
magnates
that
they
cannot
ride
rough
shod
over
the
rights
of
the
commoners
confound
them
and
ve
closed
the
wood
where
the
fernworthy
folk
used
to
picnic
these
infernal
people
seem
to
think
that
there
are
no
rights
of
property
and
that
they
can
swarm
where
they
like
with
their
papers
and
their
bottles
both
cases
decided
dr
watson
and
both
in
my
favour
haven
had
such
day
since
had
sir
john
morland
for
trespass
because
he
shot
in
his
own
warren
how
on
earth
did
you
do
that
look
it
up
in
the
books
sir
it
will
repay
reading—Frankland
morland
court
of
queen
bench
it
cost
me
£200
but
got
my
verdict
did
it
do
you
any
good
none
sir
none
am
proud
to
say
that
had
no
interest
in
the
matter
act
entirely
from
sense
of
public
duty
have
no
doubt
for
example
that
the
fernworthy
people
will
burn
me
in
effigy
to
night
told
the
police
last
time
they
did
it
that
they
should
stop
these
disgraceful
exhibitions
the
county
constabulary
is
in
scandalous
state
sir
and
it
has
not
afforded
me
the
protection
to
which
am
entitled
the
case
of
frankland
regina
will
bring
the
matter
before
the
attention
of
the
public
told
them
that
they
would
have
occasion
to
regret
their
treatment
of
me
and
already
my
words
have
come
true
how
so
asked
the
old
man
put
on
very
knowing
expression
because
could
tell
them
what
they
are
dying
to
know
but
nothing
would
induce
me
to
help
the
rascals
in
any
way
had
been
casting
round
for
some
excuse
by
which
could
get
away
from
his
gossip
but
now
began
to
wish
to
hear
more
of
it
had
seen
enough
of
the
contrary
nature
of
the
old
sinner
to
understand
that
any
strong
sign
of
interest
would
be
the
surest
way
to
stop
his
confidences
some
poaching
case
no
doubt
said
with
an
indifferent
manner
ha
my
boy
very
much
more
important
matter
than
that
what
about
the
convict
on
the
moor
started
you
don
mean
that
you
know
where
he
is
said
may
not
know
exactly
where
he
is
but
am
quite
sure
that
could
help
the
police
to
lay
their
hands
on
him
has
it
never
struck
you
that
the
way
to
catch
that
man
was
to
find
out
where
he
got
his
food
and
so
trace
it
to
him
he
certainly
seemed
to
be
getting
uncomfortably
near
the
truth
no
doubt
said
but
how
do
you
know
that
he
is
anywhere
upon
the
moor
know
it
because
have
seen
with
my
own
eyes
the
messenger
who
takes
him
his
food
my
heart
sank
for
barrymore
it
was
serious
thing
to
be
in
the
power
of
this
spiteful
old
busybody
but
his
next
remark
took
weight
from
my
mind
you
ll
be
surprised
to
hear
that
his
food
is
taken
to
him
by
child
see
him
every
day
through
my
telescope
upon
the
roof
he
passes
along
the
same
path
at
the
same
hour
and
to
whom
should
he
be
going
except
to
the
convict
here
was
luck
indeed
and
yet
suppressed
all
appearance
of
interest
child
barrymore
had
said
that
our
unknown
was
supplied
by
boy
it
was
on
his
track
and
not
upon
the
convict
that
frankland
had
stumbled
if
could
get
his
knowledge
it
might
save
me
long
and
weary
hunt
but
incredulity
and
indifference
were
evidently
my
strongest
cards
should
say
that
it
was
much
more
likely
that
it
was
the
son
of
one
of
the
moorland
shepherds
taking
out
his
father
dinner
the
least
appearance
of
opposition
struck
fire
out
of
the
old
autocrat
his
eyes
looked
malignantly
at
me
and
his
grey
whiskers
bristled
like
those
of
an
angry
cat
indeed
sir
said
he
pointing
out
over
the
wide
stretching
moor
do
you
see
that
black
tor
over
yonder
well
do
you
see
the
low
hill
beyond
with
the
thorn
bush
upon
it
is
the
stoniest
part
of
the
whole
moor
is
that
place
where
shepherd
would
be
likely
to
take
his
station
your
suggestion
sir
is
most
absurd
one
meekly
answered
that
had
spoken
without
knowing
all
the
facts
my
submission
pleased
him
and
led
him
to
further
confidences
you
may
be
sure
sir
that
have
very
good
grounds
before
come
to
an
opinion
have
seen
the
boy
again
and
again
with
his
bundle
every
day
and
sometimes
twice
day
have
been
able
but
wait
moment
dr
watson
do
my
eyes
deceive
me
or
is
there
at
the
present
moment
something
moving
upon
that
hillside
it
was
several
miles
off
but
could
distinctly
see
small
dark
dot
against
the
dull
green
and
grey
come
sir
come
cried
frankland
rushing
upstairs
you
will
see
with
your
own
eyes
and
judge
for
yourself
the
telescope
formidable
instrument
mounted
upon
tripod
stood
upon
the
flat
leads
of
the
house
frankland
clapped
his
eye
to
it
and
gave
cry
of
satisfaction
quick
dr
watson
quick
before
he
passes
over
the
hill
there
he
was
sure
enough
small
urchin
with
little
bundle
upon
his
shoulder
toiling
slowly
up
the
hill
when
he
reached
the
crest
saw
the
ragged
uncouth
figure
outlined
for
an
instant
against
the
cold
blue
sky
he
looked
round
him
with
furtive
and
stealthy
air
as
one
who
dreads
pursuit
then
he
vanished
over
the
hill
well
am
right
certainly
there
is
boy
who
seems
to
have
some
secret
errand
and
what
the
errand
is
even
county
constable
could
guess
but
not
one
word
shall
they
have
from
me
and
bind
you
to
secrecy
also
dr
watson
not
word
you
understand
just
as
you
wish
they
have
treated
me
shamefully
when
the
facts
come
out
in
frankland
regina
venture
to
think
that
thrill
of
indignation
will
run
through
the
country
nothing
would
induce
me
to
help
the
police
in
any
way
for
all
they
cared
it
might
have
been
me
instead
of
my
effigy
which
these
rascals
burned
at
the
stake
surely
you
are
not
going
you
will
help
me
to
empty
the
decanter
in
honour
of
this
great
occasion
but
resisted
all
his
solicitations
and
succeeded
in
dissuading
him
from
his
announced
intention
of
walking
home
with
me
kept
the
road
as
long
as
his
eye
was
on
me
and
then
struck
off
across
the
moor
and
made
for
the
stony
hill
over
which
the
boy
had
disappeared
everything
was
working
in
my
favour
and
swore
that
it
should
not
be
through
lack
of
energy
or
perseverance
that
should
miss
the
chance
which
fortune
had
thrown
in
my
way
the
sun
was
already
sinking
when
reached
the
summit
of
the
hill
and
the
long
slopes
beneath
me
were
all
golden
green
on
one
side
and
grey
shadow
on
the
other
haze
lay
low
upon
the
farthest
sky
line
out
of
which
jutted
the
fantastic
shapes
of
belliver
and
vixen
tor
over
the
wide
expanse
there
was
no
sound
and
no
movement
one
great
grey
bird
gull
or
curlew
soared
aloft
in
the
blue
heaven
he
and
seemed
to
be
the
only
living
things
between
the
huge
arch
of
the
sky
and
the
desert
beneath
it
the
barren
scene
the
sense
of
loneliness
and
the
mystery
and
urgency
of
my
task
all
struck
chill
into
my
heart
the
boy
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
but
down
beneath
me
in
cleft
of
the
hills
there
was
circle
of
the
old
stone
huts
and
in
the
middle
of
them
there
was
one
which
retained
sufficient
roof
to
act
as
screen
against
the
weather
my
heart
leaped
within
me
as
saw
it
this
must
be
the
burrow
where
the
stranger
lurked
at
last
my
foot
was
on
the
threshold
of
his
hiding
place
his
secret
was
within
my
grasp
as
approached
the
hut
walking
as
warily
as
stapleton
would
do
when
with
poised
net
he
drew
near
the
settled
butterfly
satisfied
myself
that
the
place
had
indeed
been
used
as
habitation
vague
pathway
among
the
boulders
led
to
the
dilapidated
opening
which
served
as
door
all
was
silent
within
the
unknown
might
be
lurking
there
or
he
might
be
prowling
on
the
moor
my
nerves
tingled
with
the
sense
of
adventure
throwing
aside
my
cigarette
closed
my
hand
upon
the
butt
of
my
revolver
and
walking
swiftly
up
to
the
door
looked
in
the
place
was
empty

but
there
were
ample
signs
that
had
not
come
upon
false
scent
this
was
certainly
where
the
man
lived
some
blankets
rolled
in
waterproof
lay
upon
that
very
stone
slab
upon
which
neolithic
man
had
once
slumbered
the
ashes
of
fire
were
heaped
in
rude
grate
beside
it
lay
some
cooking
utensils
and
bucket
half
full
of
water
litter
of
empty
tins
showed
that
the
place
had
been
occupied
for
some
time
and
saw
as
my
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
checkered
light
pannikin
and
half
full
bottle
of
spirits
standing
in
the
corner
in
the
middle
of
the
hut
flat
stone
served
the
purpose
of
table
and
upon
this
stood
small
cloth
bundle
the
same
no
doubt
which
had
seen
through
the
telescope
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
boy
it
contained
loaf
of
bread
tinned
tongue
and
two
tins
of
preserved
peaches
as
set
it
down
again
after
having
examined
it
my
heart
leaped
to
see
that
beneath
it
there
lay
sheet
of
paper
with
writing
upon
it
raised
it
and
this
was
what
read
roughly
scrawled
in
pencil
dr
watson
has
gone
to
coombe
tracey
for
minute
stood
there
with
the
paper
in
my
hands
thinking
out
the
meaning
of
this
curt
message
it
was
then
and
not
sir
henry
who
was
being
dogged
by
this
secret
man
he
had
not
followed
me
himself
but
he
had
set
an
agent
the
boy
perhaps
upon
my
track
and
this
was
his
report
possibly
had
taken
no
step
since
had
been
upon
the
moor
which
had
not
been
observed
and
repeated
always
there
was
this
feeling
of
an
unseen
force
fine
net
drawn
round
us
with
infinite
skill
and
delicacy
holding
us
so
lightly
that
it
was
only
at
some
supreme
moment
that
one
realized
that
one
was
indeed
entangled
in
its
meshes
if
there
was
one
report
there
might
be
others
so
looked
round
the
hut
in
search
of
them
there
was
no
trace
however
of
anything
of
the
kind
nor
could
discover
any
sign
which
might
indicate
the
character
or
intentions
of
the
man
who
lived
in
this
singular
place
save
that
he
must
be
of
spartan
habits
and
cared
little
for
the
comforts
of
life
when
thought
of
the
heavy
rains
and
looked
at
the
gaping
roof
understood
how
strong
and
immutable
must
be
the
purpose
which
had
kept
him
in
that
inhospitable
abode
was
he
our
malignant
enemy
or
was
he
by
chance
our
guardian
angel
swore
that
would
not
leave
the
hut
until
knew
outside
the
sun
was
sinking
low
and
the
west
was
blazing
with
scarlet
and
gold
its
reflection
was
shot
back
in
ruddy
patches
by
the
distant
pools
which
lay
amid
the
great
grimpen
mire
there
were
the
two
towers
of
baskerville
hall
and
there
distant
blur
of
smoke
which
marked
the
village
of
grimpen
between
the
two
behind
the
hill
was
the
house
of
the
stapletons
all
was
sweet
and
mellow
and
peaceful
in
the
golden
evening
light
and
yet
as
looked
at
them
my
soul
shared
none
of
the
peace
of
nature
but
quivered
at
the
vagueness
and
the
terror
of
that
interview
which
every
instant
was
bringing
nearer
with
tingling
nerves
but
fixed
purpose
sat
in
the
dark
recess
of
the
hut
and
waited
with
sombre
patience
for
the
coming
of
its
tenant
and
then
at
last
heard
him
far
away
came
the
sharp
clink
of
boot
striking
upon
stone
then
another
and
yet
another
coming
nearer
and
nearer
shrank
back
into
the
darkest
corner
and
cocked
the
pistol
in
my
pocket
determined
not
to
discover
myself
until
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
something
of
the
stranger
there
was
long
pause
which
showed
that
he
had
stopped
then
once
more
the
footsteps
approached
and
shadow
fell
across
the
opening
of
the
hut
it
is
lovely
evening
my
dear
watson
said
well
known
voice
really
think
that
you
will
be
more
comfortable
outside
than
in
xii
death
on
the
moor
for
moment
or
two
sat
breathless
hardly
able
to
believe
my
ears
then
my
senses
and
my
voice
came
back
to
me
while
crushing
weight
of
responsibility
seemed
in
an
instant
to
be
lifted
from
my
soul
that
cold
incisive
ironical
voice
could
belong
to
but
one
man
in
all
the
world
holmes
cried—
holmes
come
out
said
he
and
please
be
careful
with
the
revolver
stooped
under
the
rude
lintel
and
there
he
sat
upon
stone
outside
his
grey
eyes
dancing
with
amusement
as
they
fell
upon
my
astonished
features
he
was
thin
and
worn
but
clear
and
alert
his
keen
face
bronzed
by
the
sun
and
roughened
by
the
wind
in
his
tweed
suit
and
cloth
cap
he
looked
like
any
other
tourist
upon
the
moor
and
he
had
contrived
with
that
cat
like
love
of
personal
cleanliness
which
was
one
of
his
characteristics
that
his
chin
should
be
as
smooth
and
his
linen
as
perfect
as
if
he
were
in
baker
street
never
was
more
glad
to
see
anyone
in
my
life
said
as
wrung
him
by
the
hand
or
more
astonished
eh
well
must
confess
to
it
the
surprise
was
not
all
on
one
side
assure
you
had
no
idea
that
you
had
found
my
occasional
retreat
still
less
that
you
were
inside
it
until
was
within
twenty
paces
of
the
door
my
footprint
presume
no
watson
fear
that
could
not
undertake
to
recognize
your
footprint
amid
all
the
footprints
of
the
world
if
you
seriously
desire
to
deceive
me
you
must
change
your
tobacconist
for
when
see
the
stub
of
cigarette
marked
bradley
oxford
street
know
that
my
friend
watson
is
in
the
neighbourhood
you
will
see
it
there
beside
the
path
you
threw
it
down
no
doubt
at
that
supreme
moment
when
you
charged
into
the
empty
hut
exactly
thought
as
much
and
knowing
your
admirable
tenacity
was
convinced
that
you
were
sitting
in
ambush
weapon
within
reach
waiting
for
the
tenant
to
return
so
you
actually
thought
that
was
the
criminal
did
not
know
who
you
were
but
was
determined
to
find
out
excellent
watson
and
how
did
you
localize
me
you
saw
me
perhaps
on
the
night
of
the
convict
hunt
when
was
so
imprudent
as
to
allow
the
moon
to
rise
behind
me
yes
saw
you
then
and
have
no
doubt
searched
all
the
huts
until
you
came
to
this
one
no
your
boy
had
been
observed
and
that
gave
me
guide
where
to
look
the
old
gentleman
with
the
telescope
no
doubt
could
not
make
it
out
when
first
saw
the
light
flashing
upon
the
lens
he
rose
and
peeped
into
the
hut
ha
see
that
cartwright
has
brought
up
some
supplies
what
this
paper
so
you
have
been
to
coombe
tracey
have
you
yes
to
see
mrs
laura
lyons
exactly
well
done
our
researches
have
evidently
been
running
on
parallel
lines
and
when
we
unite
our
results
expect
we
shall
have
fairly
full
knowledge
of
the
case
well
am
glad
from
my
heart
that
you
are
here
for
indeed
the
responsibility
and
the
mystery
were
both
becoming
too
much
for
my
nerves
but
how
in
the
name
of
wonder
did
you
come
here
and
what
have
you
been
doing
thought
that
you
were
in
baker
street
working
out
that
case
of
blackmailing
that
was
what
wished
you
to
think
then
you
use
me
and
yet
do
not
trust
me
cried
with
some
bitterness
think
that
have
deserved
better
at
your
hands
holmes
my
dear
fellow
you
have
been
invaluable
to
me
in
this
as
in
many
other
cases
and
beg
that
you
will
forgive
me
if
have
seemed
to
play
trick
upon
you
in
truth
it
was
partly
for
your
own
sake
that
did
it
and
it
was
my
appreciation
of
the
danger
which
you
ran
which
led
me
to
come
down
and
examine
the
matter
for
myself
had
been
with
sir
henry
and
you
it
is
confident
that
my
point
of
view
would
have
been
the
same
as
yours
and
my
presence
would
have
warned
our
very
formidable
opponents
to
be
on
their
guard
as
it
is
have
been
able
to
get
about
as
could
not
possibly
have
done
had
been
living
in
the
hall
and
remain
an
unknown
factor
in
the
business
ready
to
throw
in
all
my
weight
at
critical
moment
but
why
keep
me
in
the
dark
for
you
to
know
could
not
have
helped
us
and
might
possibly
have
led
to
my
discovery
you
would
have
wished
to
tell
me
something
or
in
your
kindness
you
would
have
brought
me
out
some
comfort
or
other
and
so
an
unnecessary
risk
would
be
run
brought
cartwright
down
with
me
you
remember
the
little
chap
at
the
express
office
and
he
has
seen
after
my
simple
wants
loaf
of
bread
and
clean
collar
what
does
man
want
more
he
has
given
me
an
extra
pair
of
eyes
upon
very
active
pair
of
feet
and
both
have
been
invaluable
then
my
reports
have
all
been
wasted
my
voice
trembled
as
recalled
the
pains
and
the
pride
with
which
had
composed
them
holmes
took
bundle
of
papers
from
his
pocket
here
are
your
reports
my
dear
fellow
and
very
well
thumbed
assure
you
made
excellent
arrangements
and
they
are
only
delayed
one
day
upon
their
way
must
compliment
you
exceedingly
upon
the
zeal
and
the
intelligence
which
you
have
shown
over
an
extraordinarily
difficult
case
was
still
rather
raw
over
the
deception
which
had
been
practised
upon
me
but
the
warmth
of
holmes
praise
drove
my
anger
from
my
mind
felt
also
in
my
heart
that
he
was
right
in
what
he
said
and
that
it
was
really
best
for
our
purpose
that
should
not
have
known
that
he
was
upon
the
moor

that
better
said
he
seeing
the
shadow
rise
from
my
face
and
now
tell
me
the
result
of
your
visit
to
mrs
laura
lyons
it
was
not
difficult
for
me
to
guess
that
it
was
to
see
her
that
you
had
gone
for
am
already
aware
that
she
is
the
one
person
in
coombe
tracey
who
might
be
of
service
to
us
in
the
matter
in
fact
if
you
had
not
gone
to
day
it
is
exceedingly
probable
that
should
have
gone
to
morrow
the
sun
had
set
and
dusk
was
settling
over
the
moor
the
air
had
turned
chill
and
we
withdrew
into
the
hut
for
warmth
there
sitting
together
in
the
twilight
told
holmes
of
my
conversation
with
the
lady
so
interested
was
he
that
had
to
repeat
some
of
it
twice
before
he
was
satisfied
this
is
most
important
said
he
when
had
concluded
it
fills
up
gap
which
had
been
unable
to
bridge
in
this
most
complex
affair
you
are
aware
perhaps
that
close
intimacy
exists
between
this
lady
and
the
man
stapleton
did
not
know
of
close
intimacy
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
the
matter
they
meet
they
write
there
is
complete
understanding
between
them
now
this
puts
very
powerful
weapon
into
our
hands
if
could
only
use
it
to
detach
his
wife—
his
wife
am
giving
you
some
information
now
in
return
for
all
that
you
have
given
me
the
lady
who
has
passed
here
as
miss
stapleton
is
in
reality
his
wife
good
heavens
holmes
are
you
sure
of
what
you
say
how
could
he
have
permitted
sir
henry
to
fall
in
love
with
her
sir
henry
falling
in
love
could
do
no
harm
to
anyone
except
sir
henry
he
took
particular
care
that
sir
henry
did
not
make
love
to
her
as
you
have
yourself
observed
repeat
that
the
lady
is
his
wife
and
not
his
sister
but
why
this
elaborate
deception
because
he
foresaw
that
she
would
be
very
much
more
useful
to
him
in
the
character
of
free
woman
all
my
unspoken
instincts
my
vague
suspicions
suddenly
took
shape
and
centred
upon
the
naturalist
in
that
impassive
colourless
man
with
his
straw
hat
and
his
butterfly
net
seemed
to
see
something
terrible
creature
of
infinite
patience
and
craft
with
smiling
face
and
murderous
heart
it
is
he
then
who
is
our
enemy
it
is
he
who
dogged
us
in
london
so
read
the
riddle
and
the
warning
it
must
have
come
from
her
exactly
the
shape
of
some
monstrous
villainy
half
seen
half
guessed
loomed
through
the
darkness
which
had
girt
me
so
long
but
are
you
sure
of
this
holmes
how
do
you
know
that
the
woman
is
his
wife
because
he
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
tell
you
true
piece
of
autobiography
upon
the
occasion
when
he
first
met
you
and
daresay
he
has
many
time
regretted
it
since
he
was
once
schoolmaster
in
the
north
of
england
now
there
is
no
one
more
easy
to
trace
than
schoolmaster
there
are
scholastic
agencies
by
which
one
may
identify
any
man
who
has
been
in
the
profession
little
investigation
showed
me
that
school
had
come
to
grief
under
atrocious
circumstances
and
that
the
man
who
had
owned
it
the
name
was
different
had
disappeared
with
his
wife
the
descriptions
agreed
when
learned
that
the
missing
man
was
devoted
to
entomology
the
identification
was
complete
the
darkness
was
rising
but
much
was
still
hidden
by
the
shadows
if
this
woman
is
in
truth
his
wife
where
does
mrs
laura
lyons
come
in
asked
that
is
one
of
the
points
upon
which
your
own
researches
have
shed
light
your
interview
with
the
lady
has
cleared
the
situation
very
much
did
not
know
about
projected
divorce
between
herself
and
her
husband
in
that
case
regarding
stapleton
as
an
unmarried
man
she
counted
no
doubt
upon
becoming
his
wife
and
when
she
is
undeceived
why
then
we
may
find
the
lady
of
service
it
must
be
our
first
duty
to
see
her
both
of
us
to
morrow
don
you
think
watson
that
you
are
away
from
your
charge
rather
long
your
place
should
be
at
baskerville
hall
the
last
red
streaks
had
faded
away
in
the
west
and
night
had
settled
upon
the
moor
few
faint
stars
were
gleaming
in
violet
sky
one
last
question
holmes
said
as
rose
surely
there
is
no
need
of
secrecy
between
you
and
me
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
all
what
is
he
after
holmes
voice
sank
as
he
answered
it
is
murder
watson
refined
cold
blooded
deliberate
murder
do
not
ask
me
for
particulars
my
nets
are
closing
upon
him
even
as
his
are
upon
sir
henry
and
with
your
help
he
is
already
almost
at
my
mercy
there
is
but
one
danger
which
can
threaten
us
it
is
that
he
should
strike
before
we
are
ready
to
do
so
another
day
two
at
the
most
and
have
my
case
complete
but
until
then
guard
your
charge
as
closely
as
ever
fond
mother
watched
her
ailing
child
your
mission
to
day
has
justified
itself
and
yet
could
almost
wish
that
you
had
not
left
his
side
hark
terrible
scream
prolonged
yell
of
horror
and
anguish
burst
out
of
the
silence
of
the
moor
that
frightful
cry
turned
the
blood
to
ice
in
my
veins
oh
my
god
gasped
what
is
it
what
does
it
mean
holmes
had
sprung
to
his
feet
and
saw
his
dark
athletic
outline
at
the
door
of
the
hut
his
shoulders
stooping
his
head
thrust
forward
his
face
peering
into
the
darkness
hush
he
whispered
hush
the
cry
had
been
loud
on
account
of
its
vehemence
but
it
had
pealed
out
from
somewhere
far
off
on
the
shadowy
plain
now
it
burst
upon
our
ears
nearer
louder
more
urgent
than
before
where
is
it
holmes
whispered
and
knew
from
the
thrill
of
his
voice
that
he
the
man
of
iron
was
shaken
to
the
soul
where
is
it
watson
there
think
pointed
into
the
darkness
no
there
again
the
agonized
cry
swept
through
the
silent
night
louder
and
much
nearer
than
ever
and
new
sound
mingled
with
it
deep
muttered
rumble
musical
and
yet
menacing
rising
and
falling
like
the
low
constant
murmur
of
the
sea
the
hound
cried
holmes
come
watson
come
great
heavens
if
we
are
too
late
he
had
started
running
swiftly
over
the
moor
and
had
followed
at
his
heels
but
now
from
somewhere
among
the
broken
ground
immediately
in
front
of
us
there
came
one
last
despairing
yell
and
then
dull
heavy
thud
we
halted
and
listened
not
another
sound
broke
the
heavy
silence
of
the
windless
night
saw
holmes
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
like
man
distracted
he
stamped
his
feet
upon
the
ground
he
has
beaten
us
watson
we
are
too
late
no
surely
not
fool
that
was
to
hold
my
hand
and
you
watson
see
what
comes
of
abandoning
your
charge
but
by
heaven
if
the
worst
has
happened
we
ll
avenge
him
blindly
we
ran
through
the
gloom
blundering
against
boulders
forcing
our
way
through
gorse
bushes
panting
up
hills
and
rushing
down
slopes
heading
always
in
the
direction
whence
those
dreadful
sounds
had
come
at
every
rise
holmes
looked
eagerly
round
him
but
the
shadows
were
thick
upon
the
moor
and
nothing
moved
upon
its
dreary
face
can
you
see
anything
nothing
but
hark
what
is
that
low
moan
had
fallen
upon
our
ears
there
it
was
again
upon
our
left
on
that
side
ridge
of
rocks
ended
in
sheer
cliff
which
overlooked
stone
strewn
slope
on
its
jagged
face
was
spread
eagled
some
dark
irregular
object
as
we
ran
towards
it
the
vague
outline
hardened
into
definite
shape
it
was
prostrate
man
face
downward
upon
the
ground
the
head
doubled
under
him
at
horrible
angle
the
shoulders
rounded
and
the
body
hunched
together
as
if
in
the
act
of
throwing
somersault
so
grotesque
was
the
attitude
that
could
not
for
the
instant
realise
that
moan
had
been
the
passing
of
his
soul
not
whisper
not
rustle
rose
now
from
the
dark
figure
over
which
we
stooped
holmes
laid
his
hand
upon
him
and
held
it
up
again
with
an
exclamation
of
horror
the
gleam
of
the
match
which
he
struck
shone
upon
his
clotted
fingers
and
upon
the
ghastly
pool
which
widened
slowly
from
the
crushed
skull
of
the
victim
and
it
shone
upon
something
else
which
turned
our
hearts
sick
and
faint
within
us
the
body
of
sir
henry
baskerville
there
was
no
chance
of
either
of
us
forgetting
that
peculiar
ruddy
tweed
suit
the
very
one
which
he
had
worn
on
the
first
morning
that
we
had
seen
him
in
baker
street
we
caught
the
one
clear
glimpse
of
it
and
then
the
match
flickered
and
went
out
even
as
the
hope
had
gone
out
of
our
souls
holmes
groaned
and
his
face
glimmered
white
through
the
darkness
the
brute
the
brute
cried
with
clenched
hands
oh
holmes
shall
never
forgive
myself
for
having
left
him
to
his
fate
am
more
to
blame
than
you
watson
in
order
to
have
my
case
well
rounded
and
complete
have
thrown
away
the
life
of
my
client
it
is
the
greatest
blow
which
has
befallen
me
in
my
career
but
how
could
know
how
could
know
that
he
would
risk
his
life
alone
upon
the
moor
in
the
face
of
all
my
warnings

that
we
should
have
heard
his
screams
my
god
those
screams
and
yet
have
been
unable
to
save
him
where
is
this
brute
of
hound
which
drove
him
to
his
death
it
may
be
lurking
among
these
rocks
at
this
instant
and
stapleton
where
is
he
shall
answer
for
this
deed
he
shall
will
see
to
that
uncle
and
nephew
have
been
murdered
the
one
frightened
to
death
by
the
very
sight
of
beast
which
he
thought
to
be
supernatural
the
other
driven
to
his
end
in
his
wild
flight
to
escape
from
it
but
now
we
have
to
prove
the
connection
between
the
man
and
the
beast
save
from
what
we
heard
we
cannot
even
swear
to
the
existence
of
the
latter
since
sir
henry
has
evidently
died
from
the
fall
but
by
heavens
cunning
as
he
is
the
fellow
shall
be
in
my
power
before
another
day
is
past
we
stood
with
bitter
hearts
on
either
side
of
the
mangled
body
overwhelmed
by
this
sudden
and
irrevocable
disaster
which
had
brought
all
our
long
and
weary
labours
to
so
piteous
an
end
then
as
the
moon
rose
we
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
rocks
over
which
our
poor
friend
had
fallen
and
from
the
summit
we
gazed
out
over
the
shadowy
moor
half
silver
and
half
gloom
far
away
miles
off
in
the
direction
of
grimpen
single
steady
yellow
light
was
shining
it
could
only
come
from
the
lonely
abode
of
the
stapletons
with
bitter
curse
shook
my
fist
at
it
as
gazed
why
should
we
not
seize
him
at
once
our
case
is
not
complete
the
fellow
is
wary
and
cunning
to
the
last
degree
it
is
not
what
we
know
but
what
we
can
prove
if
we
make
one
false
move
the
villain
may
escape
us
yet
what
can
we
do
there
will
be
plenty
for
us
to
do
to
morrow
to
night
we
can
only
perform
the
last
offices
to
our
poor
friend
together
we
made
our
way
down
the
precipitous
slope
and
approached
the
body
black
and
clear
against
the
silvered
stones
the
agony
of
those
contorted
limbs
struck
me
with
spasm
of
pain
and
blurred
my
eyes
with
tears
we
must
send
for
help
holmes
we
cannot
carry
him
all
the
way
to
the
hall
good
heavens
are
you
mad
he
had
uttered
cry
and
bent
over
the
body
now
he
was
dancing
and
laughing
and
wringing
my
hand
could
this
be
my
stern
self
contained
friend
these
were
hidden
fires
indeed
beard
the
man
has
beard
it
is
not
the
baronet
it
is
why
it
is
my
neighbour
the
convict
with
feverish
haste
we
had
turned
the
body
over
and
that
dripping
beard
was
pointing
up
to
the
cold
clear
moon
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
the
beetling
forehead
the
sunken
animal
eyes
it
was
indeed
the
same
face
which
had
glared
upon
me
in
the
light
of
the
candle
from
over
the
rock
the
face
of
selden
the
criminal
then
in
an
instant
it
was
all
clear
to
me
remembered
how
the
baronet
had
told
me
that
he
had
handed
his
old
wardrobe
to
barrymore
had
passed
it
on
in
order
to
help
selden
in
his
escape
boots
shirt
cap
it
was
all
sir
henry
the
tragedy
was
still
black
enough
but
this
man
had
at
least
deserved
death
by
the
laws
of
his
country
told
holmes
how
the
matter
stood
my
heart
bubbling
over
with
thankfulness
and
joy
then
the
clothes
have
been
the
poor
devil
death
said
he
it
is
clear
enough
that
the
hound
has
been
laid
on
from
some
article
of
sir
henry
the
boot
which
was
abstracted
in
the
hotel
in
all
probability
and
so
ran
this
man
down
there
is
one
very
singular
thing
however
how
came
selden
in
the
darkness
to
know
that
the
hound
was
on
his
trail
he
heard
him
to
hear
hound
upon
the
moor
would
not
work
hard
man
like
this
convict
into
such
paroxysm
of
terror
that
he
would
risk
recapture
by
screaming
wildly
for
help
by
his
cries
he
must
have
run
long
way
after
he
knew
the
animal
was
on
his
track
how
did
he
know
greater
mystery
to
me
is
why
this
hound
presuming
that
all
our
conjectures
are
correct
presume
nothing
well
then
why
this
hound
should
be
loose
to
night
suppose
that
it
does
not
always
run
loose
upon
the
moor
stapleton
would
not
let
it
go
unless
he
had
reason
to
think
that
sir
henry
would
be
there
my
difficulty
is
the
more
formidable
of
the
two
for
think
that
we
shall
very
shortly
get
an
explanation
of
yours
while
mine
may
remain
for
ever
mystery
the
question
now
is
what
shall
we
do
with
this
poor
wretch
body
we
cannot
leave
it
here
to
the
foxes
and
the
ravens
suggest
that
we
put
it
in
one
of
the
huts
until
we
can
communicate
with
the
police
exactly
have
no
doubt
that
you
and
could
carry
it
so
far
halloa
watson
what
this
it
the
man
himself
by
all
that
wonderful
and
audacious
not
word
to
show
your
suspicions
not
word
or
my
plans
crumble
to
the
ground
figure
was
approaching
us
over
the
moor
and
saw
the
dull
red
glow
of
cigar
the
moon
shone
upon
him
and
could
distinguish
the
dapper
shape
and
jaunty
walk
of
the
naturalist
he
stopped
when
he
saw
us
and
then
came
on
again
why
dr
watson
that
not
you
is
it
you
are
the
last
man
that
should
have
expected
to
see
out
on
the
moor
at
this
time
of
night
but
dear
me
what
this
somebody
hurt
not
don
tell
me
that
it
is
our
friend
sir
henry
he
hurried
past
me
and
stooped
over
the
dead
man
heard
sharp
intake
of
his
breath
and
the
cigar
fell
from
his
fingers
who
this
he
stammered
it
is
selden
the
man
who
escaped
from
princetown
stapleton
turned
ghastly
face
upon
us
but
by
supreme
effort
he
had
overcome
his
amazement
and
his
disappointment
he
looked
sharply
from
holmes
to
me
dear
me
what
very
shocking
affair
how
did
he
die
he
appears
to
have
broken
his
neck
by
falling
over
these
rocks
my
friend
and
were
strolling
on
the
moor
when
we
heard
cry
heard
cry
also
that
was
what
brought
me
out
was
uneasy
about
sir
henry
why
about
sir
henry
in
particular
could
not
help
asking
because
had
suggested
that
he
should
come
over
when
he
did
not
come
was
surprised
and
naturally
became
alarmed
for
his
safety
when
heard
cries
upon
the
moor
by
the
way
his
eyes
darted
again
from
my
face
to
holmes
s—
did
you
hear
anything
else
besides
cry
no
said
holmes
did
you
no
what
do
you
mean
then
oh
you
know
the
stories
that
the
peasants
tell
about
phantom
hound
and
so
on
it
is
said
to
be
heard
at
night
upon
the
moor
was
wondering
if
there
were
any
evidence
of
such
sound
to
night
we
heard
nothing
of
the
kind
said
and
what
is
your
theory
of
this
poor
fellow
death
have
no
doubt
that
anxiety
and
exposure
have
driven
him
off
his
head
he
has
rushed
about
the
moor
in
crazy
state
and
eventually
fallen
over
here
and
broken
his
neck
that
seems
the
most
reasonable
theory
said
stapleton
and
he
gave
sigh
which
took
to
indicate
his
relief
what
do
you
think
about
it
mr
sherlock
holmes
my
friend
bowed
his
compliments
you
are
quick
at
identification
said
he
we
have
been
expecting
you
in
these
parts
since
dr
watson
came
down
you
are
in
time
to
see
tragedy
yes
indeed
have
no
doubt
that
my
friend
explanation
will
cover
the
facts
will
take
an
unpleasant
remembrance
back
to
london
with
me
to
morrow
oh
you
return
to
morrow
that
is
my
intention
hope
your
visit
has
cast
some
light
upon
those
occurrences
which
have
puzzled
us
holmes
shrugged
his
shoulders
one
cannot
always
have
the
success
for
which
one
hopes
an
investigator
needs
facts
and
not
legends
or
rumours
it
has
not
been
satisfactory
case
my
friend
spoke
in
his
frankest
and
most
unconcerned
manner
stapleton
still
looked
hard
at
him
then
he
turned
to
me
would
suggest
carrying
this
poor
fellow
to
my
house
but
it
would
give
my
sister
such
fright
that
do
not
feel
justified
in
doing
it
think
that
if
we
put
something
over
his
face
he
will
be
safe
until
morning
and
so
it
was
arranged
resisting
stapleton
offer
of
hospitality
holmes
and
set
off
to
baskerville
hall
leaving
the
naturalist
to
return
alone
looking
back
we
saw
the
figure
moving
slowly
away
over
the
broad
moor
and
behind
him
that
one
black
smudge
on
the
silvered
slope
which
showed
where
the
man
was
lying
who
had
come
so
horribly
to
his
end
we
re
at
close
grips
at
last
said
holmes
as
we
walked
together
across
the
moor
what
nerve
the
fellow
has
how
he
pulled
himself
together
in
the
face
of
what
must
have
been
paralyzing
shock
when
he
found
that
the
wrong
man
had
fallen
victim
to
his
plot
told
you
in
london
watson
and
tell
you
now
again
that
we
have
never
had
foeman
more
worthy
of
our
steel
am
sorry
that
he
has
seen
you
and
so
was
at
first
but
there
was
no
getting
out
of
it
what
effect
do
you
think
it
will
have
upon
his
plans
now
that
he
knows
you
are
here

it
may
cause
him
to
be
more
cautious
or
it
may
drive
him
to
desperate
measures
at
once
like
most
clever
criminals
he
may
be
too
confident
in
his
own
cleverness
and
imagine
that
he
has
completely
deceived
us
why
should
we
not
arrest
him
at
once
my
dear
watson
you
were
born
to
be
man
of
action
your
instinct
is
always
to
do
something
energetic
but
supposing
for
argument
sake
that
we
had
him
arrested
to
night
what
on
earth
the
better
off
should
we
be
for
that
we
could
prove
nothing
against
him
there
the
devilish
cunning
of
it
if
he
were
acting
through
human
agent
we
could
get
some
evidence
but
if
we
were
to
drag
this
great
dog
to
the
light
of
day
it
would
not
help
us
in
putting
rope
round
the
neck
of
its
master
surely
we
have
case
not
shadow
of
one
only
surmise
and
conjecture
we
should
be
laughed
out
of
court
if
we
came
with
such
story
and
such
evidence
there
is
sir
charles
death
found
dead
without
mark
upon
him
you
and
know
that
he
died
of
sheer
fright
and
we
know
also
what
frightened
him
but
how
are
we
to
get
twelve
stolid
jurymen
to
know
it
what
signs
are
there
of
hound
where
are
the
marks
of
its
fangs
of
course
we
know
that
hound
does
not
bite
dead
body
and
that
sir
charles
was
dead
before
ever
the
brute
overtook
him
but
we
have
to
prove
all
this
and
we
are
not
in
position
to
do
it
well
then
to
night
we
are
not
much
better
off
to
night
again
there
was
no
direct
connection
between
the
hound
and
the
man
death
we
never
saw
the
hound
we
heard
it
but
we
could
not
prove
that
it
was
running
upon
this
man
trail
there
is
complete
absence
of
motive
no
my
dear
fellow
we
must
reconcile
ourselves
to
the
fact
that
we
have
no
case
at
present
and
that
it
is
worth
our
while
to
run
any
risk
in
order
to
establish
one
and
how
do
you
propose
to
do
so
have
great
hopes
of
what
mrs
laura
lyons
may
do
for
us
when
the
position
of
affairs
is
made
clear
to
her
and
have
my
own
plan
as
well
sufficient
for
to
morrow
is
the
evil
thereof
but
hope
before
the
day
is
past
to
have
the
upper
hand
at
last
could
draw
nothing
further
from
him
and
he
walked
lost
in
thought
as
far
as
the
baskerville
gates
are
you
coming
up
yes
see
no
reason
for
further
concealment
but
one
last
word
watson
say
nothing
of
the
hound
to
sir
henry
let
him
think
that
selden
death
was
as
stapleton
would
have
us
believe
he
will
have
better
nerve
for
the
ordeal
which
he
will
have
to
undergo
to
morrow
when
he
is
engaged
if
remember
your
report
aright
to
dine
with
these
people
and
so
am
then
you
must
excuse
yourself
and
he
must
go
alone
that
will
be
easily
arranged
and
now
if
we
are
too
late
for
dinner
think
that
we
are
both
ready
for
our
suppers
xiii
fixing
the
nets
sir
henry
was
more
pleased
than
surprised
to
see
sherlock
holmes
for
he
had
for
some
days
been
expecting
that
recent
events
would
bring
him
down
from
london
he
did
raise
his
eyebrows
however
when
he
found
that
my
friend
had
neither
any
luggage
nor
any
explanations
for
its
absence
between
us
we
soon
supplied
his
wants
and
then
over
belated
supper
we
explained
to
the
baronet
as
much
of
our
experience
as
it
seemed
desirable
that
he
should
know
but
first
had
the
unpleasant
duty
of
breaking
the
news
to
barrymore
and
his
wife
to
him
it
may
have
been
an
unmitigated
relief
but
she
wept
bitterly
in
her
apron
to
all
the
world
he
was
the
man
of
violence
half
animal
and
half
demon
but
to
her
he
always
remained
the
little
wilful
boy
of
her
own
girlhood
the
child
who
had
clung
to
her
hand
evil
indeed
is
the
man
who
has
not
one
woman
to
mourn
him
ve
been
moping
in
the
house
all
day
since
watson
went
off
in
the
morning
said
the
baronet
guess
should
have
some
credit
for
have
kept
my
promise
if
hadn
sworn
not
to
go
about
alone
might
have
had
more
lively
evening
for
had
message
from
stapleton
asking
me
over
there
have
no
doubt
that
you
would
have
had
more
lively
evening
said
holmes
drily
by
the
way
don
suppose
you
appreciate
that
we
have
been
mourning
over
you
as
having
broken
your
neck
sir
henry
opened
his
eyes
how
was
that
this
poor
wretch
was
dressed
in
your
clothes
fear
your
servant
who
gave
them
to
him
may
get
into
trouble
with
the
police
that
is
unlikely
there
was
no
mark
on
any
of
them
as
far
as
know
that
lucky
for
him
in
fact
it
lucky
for
all
of
you
since
you
are
all
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
law
in
this
matter
am
not
sure
that
as
conscientious
detective
my
first
duty
is
not
to
arrest
the
whole
household
watson
reports
are
most
incriminating
documents
but
how
about
the
case
asked
the
baronet
have
you
made
anything
out
of
the
tangle
don
know
that
watson
and
are
much
the
wiser
since
we
came
down
think
that
shall
be
in
position
to
make
the
situation
rather
more
clear
to
you
before
long
it
has
been
an
exceedingly
difficult
and
most
complicated
business
there
are
several
points
upon
which
we
still
want
light
but
it
is
coming
all
the
same
we
ve
had
one
experience
as
watson
has
no
doubt
told
you
we
heard
the
hound
on
the
moor
so
can
swear
that
it
is
not
all
empty
superstition
had
something
to
do
with
dogs
when
was
out
west
and
know
one
when
hear
one
if
you
can
muzzle
that
one
and
put
him
on
chain
ll
be
ready
to
swear
you
are
the
greatest
detective
of
all
time
think
will
muzzle
him
and
chain
him
all
right
if
you
will
give
me
your
help
whatever
you
tell
me
to
do
will
do
very
good
and
will
ask
you
also
to
do
it
blindly
without
always
asking
the
reason
just
as
you
like
if
you
will
do
this
think
the
chances
are
that
our
little
problem
will
soon
be
solved
have
no
doubt—
he
stopped
suddenly
and
stared
fixedly
up
over
my
head
into
the
air
the
lamp
beat
upon
his
face
and
so
intent
was
it
and
so
still
that
it
might
have
been
that
of
clear
cut
classical
statue
personification
of
alertness
and
expectation
what
is
it
we
both
cried
could
see
as
he
looked
down
that
he
was
repressing
some
internal
emotion
his
features
were
still
composed
but
his
eyes
shone
with
amused
exultation
excuse
the
admiration
of
connoisseur
said
he
as
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
line
of
portraits
which
covered
the
opposite
wall
watson
won
allow
that
know
anything
of
art
but
that
is
mere
jealousy
because
our
views
upon
the
subject
differ
now
these
are
really
very
fine
series
of
portraits
well
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
said
sir
henry
glancing
with
some
surprise
at
my
friend
don
pretend
to
know
much
about
these
things
and
be
better
judge
of
horse
or
steer
than
of
picture
didn
know
that
you
found
time
for
such
things
know
what
is
good
when
see
it
and
see
it
now
that
kneller
ll
swear
that
lady
in
the
blue
silk
over
yonder
and
the
stout
gentleman
with
the
wig
ought
to
be
reynolds
they
are
all
family
portraits
presume
every
one
do
you
know
the
names
barrymore
has
been
coaching
me
in
them
and
think
can
say
my
lessons
fairly
well
who
is
the
gentleman
with
the
telescope
that
is
rear
admiral
baskerville
who
served
under
rodney
in
the
west
indies
the
man
with
the
blue
coat
and
the
roll
of
paper
is
sir
william
baskerville
who
was
chairman
of
committees
of
the
house
of
commons
under
pitt
and
this
cavalier
opposite
to
me
the
one
with
the
black
velvet
and
the
lace
ah
you
have
right
to
know
about
him
that
is
the
cause
of
all
the
mischief
the
wicked
hugo
who
started
the
hound
of
the
baskervilles
we
re
not
likely
to
forget
him
gazed
with
interest
and
some
surprise
upon
the
portrait
dear
me
said
holmes
he
seems
quiet
meek
mannered
man
enough
but
dare
say
that
there
was
lurking
devil
in
his
eyes
had
pictured
him
as
more
robust
and
ruffianly
person
there
no
doubt
about
the
authenticity
for
the
name
and
the
date
1647
are
on
the
back
of
the
canvas
holmes
said
little
more
but
the
picture
of
the
old
roysterer
seemed
to
have
fascination
for
him
and
his
eyes
were
continually
fixed
upon
it
during
supper
it
was
not
until
later
when
sir
henry
had
gone
to
his
room
that
was
able
to
follow
the
trend
of
his
thoughts
he
led
me
back
into
the
banqueting
hall
his
bedroom
candle
in
his
hand
and
he
held
it
up
against
the
time
stained
portrait
on
the
wall
do
you
see
anything
there
looked
at
the
broad
plumed
hat
the
curling
love
locks
the
white
lace
collar
and
the
straight
severe
face
which
was
framed
between
them
lt
was
not
brutal
countenance
but
it
was
prim
hard
and
stern
with
firm
set
thin
lipped
mouth
and
coldly
intolerant
eye

is
it
like
anyone
you
know
there
is
something
of
sir
henry
about
the
jaw
just
suggestion
perhaps
but
wait
an
instant
he
stood
upon
chair
and
holding
up
the
light
in
his
left
hand
he
curved
his
right
arm
over
the
broad
hat
and
round
the
long
ringlets
good
heavens
cried
in
amazement
the
face
of
stapleton
had
sprung
out
of
the
canvas
ha
you
see
it
now
my
eyes
have
been
trained
to
examine
faces
and
not
their
trimmings
it
is
the
first
quality
of
criminal
investigator
that
he
should
see
through
disguise
but
this
is
marvellous
it
might
be
his
portrait
yes
it
is
an
interesting
instance
of
throw
back
which
appears
to
be
both
physical
and
spiritual
study
of
family
portraits
is
enough
to
convert
man
to
the
doctrine
of
reincarnation
the
fellow
is
baskerville
that
is
evident
with
designs
upon
the
succession
exactly
this
chance
of
the
picture
has
supplied
us
with
one
of
our
most
obvious
missing
links
we
have
him
watson
we
have
him
and
dare
swear
that
before
to
morrow
night
he
will
be
fluttering
in
our
net
as
helpless
as
one
of
his
own
butterflies
pin
cork
and
card
and
we
add
him
to
the
baker
street
collection
he
burst
into
one
of
his
rare
fits
of
laughter
as
he
turned
away
from
the
picture
have
not
heard
him
laugh
often
and
it
has
always
boded
ill
to
somebody
was
up
betimes
in
the
morning
but
holmes
was
afoot
earlier
still
for
saw
him
as
dressed
coming
up
the
drive
yes
we
should
have
full
day
to
day
he
remarked
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
with
the
joy
of
action
the
nets
are
all
in
place
and
the
drag
is
about
to
begin
we
ll
know
before
the
day
is
out
whether
we
have
caught
our
big
lean
jawed
pike
or
whether
he
has
got
through
the
meshes
have
you
been
on
the
moor
already
have
sent
report
from
grimpen
to
princetown
as
to
the
death
of
selden
think
can
promise
that
none
of
you
will
be
troubled
in
the
matter
and
have
also
communicated
with
my
faithful
cartwright
who
would
certainly
have
pined
away
at
the
door
of
my
hut
as
dog
does
at
his
master
grave
if
had
not
set
his
mind
at
rest
about
my
safety
what
is
the
next
move
to
see
sir
henry
ah
here
he
is
good
morning
holmes
said
the
baronet
you
look
like
general
who
is
planning
battle
with
his
chief
of
the
staff
that
is
the
exact
situation
watson
was
asking
for
orders
and
so
do
very
good
you
are
engaged
as
understand
to
dine
with
our
friends
the
stapletons
to
night
hope
that
you
will
come
also
they
are
very
hospitable
people
and
am
sure
that
they
would
be
very
glad
to
see
you
fear
that
watson
and
must
go
to
london
to
london
yes
think
that
we
should
be
more
useful
there
at
the
present
juncture
the
baronet
face
perceptibly
lengthened
hoped
that
you
were
going
to
see
me
through
this
business
the
hall
and
the
moor
are
not
very
pleasant
places
when
one
is
alone
my
dear
fellow
you
must
trust
me
implicitly
and
do
exactly
what
tell
you
can
tell
your
friends
that
we
should
have
been
happy
to
have
come
with
you
but
that
urgent
business
required
us
to
be
in
town
we
hope
very
soon
to
return
to
devonshire
will
you
remember
to
give
them
that
message
if
you
insist
upon
it
there
is
no
alternative
assure
you
saw
by
the
baronet
clouded
brow
that
he
was
deeply
hurt
by
what
he
regarded
as
our
desertion
when
do
you
desire
to
go
he
asked
coldly
immediately
after
breakfast
we
will
drive
in
to
coombe
tracey
but
watson
will
leave
his
things
as
pledge
that
he
will
come
back
to
you
watson
you
will
send
note
to
stapleton
to
tell
him
that
you
regret
that
you
cannot
come
have
good
mind
to
go
to
london
with
you
said
the
baronet
why
should
stay
here
alone
because
it
is
your
post
of
duty
because
you
gave
me
your
word
that
you
would
do
as
you
were
told
and
tell
you
to
stay
all
right
then
ll
stay
one
more
direction
wish
you
to
drive
to
merripit
house
send
back
your
trap
however
and
let
them
know
that
you
intend
to
walk
home
to
walk
across
the
moor
yes
but
that
is
the
very
thing
which
you
have
so
often
cautioned
me
not
to
do
this
time
you
may
do
it
with
safety
if
had
not
every
confidence
in
your
nerve
and
courage
would
not
suggest
it
but
it
is
essential
that
you
should
do
it
then
will
do
it
and
as
you
value
your
life
do
not
go
across
the
moor
in
any
direction
save
along
the
straight
path
which
leads
from
merripit
house
to
the
grimpen
road
and
is
your
natural
way
home
will
do
just
what
you
say
very
good
should
be
glad
to
get
away
as
soon
after
breakfast
as
possible
so
as
to
reach
london
in
the
afternoon
was
much
astounded
by
this
programme
though
remembered
that
holmes
had
said
to
stapleton
on
the
night
before
that
his
visit
would
terminate
next
day
it
had
not
crossed
my
mind
however
that
he
would
wish
me
to
go
with
him
nor
could
understand
how
we
could
both
be
absent
at
moment
which
he
himself
declared
to
be
critical
there
was
nothing
for
it
however
but
implicit
obedience
so
we
bade
good
bye
to
our
rueful
friend
and
couple
of
hours
afterwards
we
were
at
the
station
of
coombe
tracey
and
had
dispatched
the
trap
upon
its
return
journey
small
boy
was
waiting
upon
the
platform
any
orders
sir
you
will
take
this
train
to
town
cartwright
the
moment
you
arrive
you
will
send
wire
to
sir
henry
baskerville
in
my
name
to
say
that
if
he
finds
the
pocket
book
which
have
dropped
he
is
to
send
it
by
registered
post
to
baker
street
yes
sir
and
ask
at
the
station
office
if
there
is
message
for
me
the
boy
returned
with
telegram
which
holmes
handed
to
me
it
ran—
wire
received
coming
down
with
unsigned
warrant
arrive
five
forty
lestrade
that
is
in
answer
to
mine
of
this
morning
he
is
the
best
of
the
professionals
think
and
we
may
need
his
assistance
now
watson
think
that
we
cannot
employ
our
time
better
than
by
calling
upon
your
acquaintance
mrs
laura
lyons
his
plan
of
campaign
was
beginning
to
be
evident
he
would
use
the
baronet
in
order
to
convince
the
stapletons
that
we
were
really
gone
while
we
should
actually
return
at
the
instant
when
we
were
likely
to
be
needed
that
telegram
from
london
if
mentioned
by
sir
henry
to
the
stapletons
must
remove
the
last
suspicions
from
their
minds
already
seemed
to
see
our
nets
drawing
closer
around
that
lean
jawed
pike
mrs
laura
lyons
was
in
her
office
and
sherlock
holmes
opened
his
interview
with
frankness
and
directness
which
considerably
amazed
her
am
investigating
the
circumstances
which
attended
the
death
of
the
late
sir
charles
baskerville
said
he
my
friend
here
dr
watson
has
informed
me
of
what
you
have
communicated
and
also
of
what
you
have
withheld
in
connection
with
that
matter
what
have
withheld
she
asked
defiantly
you
have
confessed
that
you
asked
sir
charles
to
be
at
the
gate
at
ten
clock
we
know
that
was
the
place
and
hour
of
his
death
you
have
withheld
what
the
connection
is
between
these
events
there
is
no
connection
in
that
case
the
coincidence
must
indeed
be
an
extraordinary
one
but
think
that
we
shall
succeed
in
establishing
connection
after
all
wish
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
mrs
lyons
we
regard
this
case
as
one
of
murder
and
the
evidence
may
implicate
not
only
your
friend
mr
stapleton
but
his
wife
as
well
the
lady
sprang
from
her
chair
his
wife
she
cried
the
fact
is
no
longer
secret
the
person
who
has
passed
for
his
sister
is
really
his
wife
mrs
lyons
had
resumed
her
seat
her
hands
were
grasping
the
arms
of
her
chair
and
saw
that
the
pink
nails
had
turned
white
with
the
pressure
of
her
grip
his
wife
she
said
again
his
wife
he
is
not
married
man
sherlock
holmes
shrugged
his
shoulders
prove
it
to
me
prove
it
to
me
and
if
you
can
do
so
the
fierce
flash
of
her
eyes
said
more
than
any
words
have
come
prepared
to
do
so
said
holmes
drawing
several
papers
from
his
pocket
here
is
photograph
of
the
couple
taken
in
york
four
years
ago
it
is
indorsed
mr
and
mrs
vandeleur
but
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
him
and
her
also
if
you
know
her
by
sight
here
are
three
written
descriptions
by
trustworthy
witnesses
of
mr
and
mrs
vandeleur
who
at
that
time
kept
st
oliver
private
school
read
them
and
see
if
you
can
doubt
the
identity
of
these
people
she
glanced
at
them
and
then
looked
up
at
us
with
the
set
rigid
face
of
desperate
woman
mr
holmes
she
said
this
man
had
offered
me
marriage
on
condition
that
could
get
divorce
from
my
husband
he
has
lied
to
me
the
villain
in
every
conceivable
way
not
one
word
of
truth
has
he
ever
told
me
and
why
imagined
that
all
was
for
my
own
sake
but
now
see
that
was
never
anything
but
tool
in
his
hands
why
should
preserve
faith
with
him
who
never
kept
any
with
me
why
should
try
to
shield
him
from
the
consequences
of
his
own
wicked
acts
ask
me
what
you
like
and
there
is
nothing
which
shall
hold
back
one
thing
swear
to
you
and
that
is
that
when
wrote
the
letter
never
dreamed
of
any
harm
to
the
old
gentleman
who
had
been
my
kindest
friend

entirely
believe
you
madam
said
sherlock
holmes
the
recital
of
these
events
must
be
very
painful
to
you
and
perhaps
it
will
make
it
easier
if
tell
you
what
occurred
and
you
can
check
me
if
make
any
material
mistake
the
sending
of
this
letter
was
suggested
to
you
by
stapleton
he
dictated
it
presume
that
the
reason
he
gave
was
that
you
would
receive
help
from
sir
charles
for
the
legal
expenses
connected
with
your
divorce
exactly
and
then
after
you
had
sent
the
letter
he
dissuaded
you
from
keeping
the
appointment
he
told
me
that
it
would
hurt
his
self
respect
that
any
other
man
should
find
the
money
for
such
an
object
and
that
though
he
was
poor
man
himself
he
would
devote
his
last
penny
to
removing
the
obstacles
which
divided
us
he
appears
to
be
very
consistent
character
and
then
you
heard
nothing
until
you
read
the
reports
of
the
death
in
the
paper
no
and
he
made
you
swear
to
say
nothing
about
your
appointment
with
sir
charles
he
did
he
said
that
the
death
was
very
mysterious
one
and
that
should
certainly
be
suspected
if
the
facts
came
out
he
frightened
me
into
remaining
silent
quite
so
but
you
had
your
suspicions
she
hesitated
and
looked
down
knew
him
she
said
but
if
he
had
kept
faith
with
me
should
always
have
done
so
with
him
think
that
on
the
whole
you
have
had
fortunate
escape
said
sherlock
holmes
you
have
had
him
in
your
power
and
he
knew
it
and
yet
you
are
alive
you
have
been
walking
for
some
months
very
near
to
the
edge
of
precipice
we
must
wish
you
good
morning
now
mrs
lyons
and
it
is
probable
that
you
will
very
shortly
hear
from
us
again
our
case
becomes
rounded
off
and
difficulty
after
difficulty
thins
away
in
front
of
us
said
holmes
as
we
stood
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
express
from
town
shall
soon
be
in
the
position
of
being
able
to
put
into
single
connected
narrative
one
of
the
most
singular
and
sensational
crimes
of
modern
times
students
of
criminology
will
remember
the
analogous
incidents
in
godno
in
little
russia
in
the
year
66
and
of
course
there
are
the
anderson
murders
in
north
carolina
but
this
case
possesses
some
features
which
are
entirely
its
own
even
now
we
have
no
clear
case
against
this
very
wily
man
but
shall
be
very
much
surprised
if
it
is
not
clear
enough
before
we
go
to
bed
this
night
the
london
express
came
roaring
into
the
station
and
small
wiry
bulldog
of
man
had
sprung
from
first
class
carriage
we
all
three
shook
hands
and
saw
at
once
from
the
reverential
way
in
which
lestrade
gazed
at
my
companion
that
he
had
learned
good
deal
since
the
days
when
they
had
first
worked
together
could
well
remember
the
scorn
which
the
theories
of
the
reasoner
used
then
to
excite
in
the
practical
man
anything
good
he
asked
the
biggest
thing
for
years
said
holmes
we
have
two
hours
before
we
need
think
of
starting
think
we
might
employ
it
in
getting
some
dinner
and
then
lestrade
we
will
take
the
london
fog
out
of
your
throat
by
giving
you
breath
of
the
pure
night
air
of
dartmoor
never
been
there
ah
well
don
suppose
you
will
forget
your
first
visit
xiv
the
hound
of
the
baskervilles
one
of
sherlock
holmes
defects
if
indeed
one
may
call
it
defect
was
that
he
was
exceedingly
loath
to
communicate
his
full
plans
to
any
other
person
until
the
instant
of
their
fulfilment
partly
it
came
no
doubt
from
his
own
masterful
nature
which
loved
to
dominate
and
surprise
those
who
were
around
him
partly
also
from
his
professional
caution
which
urged
him
never
to
take
any
chances
the
result
however
was
very
trying
for
those
who
were
acting
as
his
agents
and
assistants
had
often
suffered
under
it
but
never
more
so
than
during
that
long
drive
in
the
darkness
the
great
ordeal
was
in
front
of
us
at
last
we
were
about
to
make
our
final
effort
and
yet
holmes
had
said
nothing
and
could
only
surmise
what
his
course
of
action
would
be
my
nerves
thrilled
with
anticipation
when
at
last
the
cold
wind
upon
our
faces
and
the
dark
void
spaces
on
either
side
of
the
narrow
road
told
me
that
we
were
back
upon
the
moor
once
again
every
stride
of
the
horses
and
every
turn
of
the
wheels
was
taking
us
nearer
to
our
supreme
adventure
our
conversation
was
hampered
by
the
presence
of
the
driver
of
the
hired
wagonette
so
that
we
were
forced
to
talk
of
trivial
matters
when
our
nerves
were
tense
with
emotion
and
anticipation
it
was
relief
to
me
after
that
unnatural
restraint
when
we
at
last
passed
frankland
house
and
knew
that
we
were
drawing
near
to
the
hall
and
to
the
scene
of
action
we
did
not
drive
up
to
the
door
but
got
down
near
the
gate
of
the
avenue
the
wagonette
was
paid
off
and
ordered
to
return
to
coombe
tracey
forthwith
while
we
started
to
walk
to
merripit
house
are
you
armed
lestrade
the
little
detective
smiled
as
long
as
have
my
trousers
have
hip
pocket
and
as
long
as
have
my
hip
pocket
have
something
in
it
good
my
friend
and
are
also
ready
for
emergencies
you
re
mighty
close
about
this
affair
mr
holmes
what
the
game
now
waiting
game
my
word
it
does
not
seem
very
cheerful
place
said
the
detective
with
shiver
glancing
round
him
at
the
gloomy
slopes
of
the
hill
and
at
the
huge
lake
of
fog
which
lay
over
the
grimpen
mire
see
the
lights
of
house
ahead
of
us
that
is
merripit
house
and
the
end
of
our
journey
must
request
you
to
walk
on
tiptoe
and
not
to
talk
above
whisper
we
moved
cautiously
along
the
track
as
if
we
were
bound
for
the
house
but
holmes
halted
us
when
we
were
about
two
hundred
yards
from
it
this
will
do
said
he
these
rocks
upon
the
right
make
an
admirable
screen
we
are
to
wait
here
yes
we
shall
make
our
little
ambush
here
get
into
this
hollow
lestrade
you
have
been
inside
the
house
have
you
not
watson
can
you
tell
the
position
of
the
rooms
what
are
those
latticed
windows
at
this
end
think
they
are
the
kitchen
windows
and
the
one
beyond
which
shines
so
brightly
that
is
certainly
the
dining
room
the
blinds
are
up
you
know
the
lie
of
the
land
best
creep
forward
quietly
and
see
what
they
are
doing
but
for
heaven
sake
don
let
them
know
that
they
are
watched
tiptoed
down
the
path
and
stooped
behind
the
low
wall
which
surrounded
the
stunted
orchard
creeping
in
its
shadow
reached
point
whence
could
look
straight
through
the
uncurtained
window
there
were
only
two
men
in
the
room
sir
henry
and
stapleton
they
sat
with
their
profiles
towards
me
on
either
side
of
the
round
table
both
of
them
were
smoking
cigars
and
coffee
and
wine
were
in
front
of
them
stapleton
was
talking
with
animation
but
the
baronet
looked
pale
and
distrait
perhaps
the
thought
of
that
lonely
walk
across
the
ill
omened
moor
was
weighing
heavily
upon
his
mind
as
watched
them
stapleton
rose
and
left
the
room
while
sir
henry
filled
his
glass
again
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
puffing
at
his
cigar
heard
the
creak
of
door
and
the
crisp
sound
of
boots
upon
gravel
the
steps
passed
along
the
path
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
under
which
crouched
looking
over
saw
the
naturalist
pause
at
the
door
of
an
out
house
in
the
corner
of
the
orchard
key
turned
in
lock
and
as
he
passed
in
there
was
curious
scuffling
noise
from
within
he
was
only
minute
or
so
inside
and
then
heard
the
key
turn
once
more
and
he
passed
me
and
re
entered
the
house
saw
him
rejoin
his
guest
and
crept
quietly
back
to
where
my
companions
were
waiting
to
tell
them
what
had
seen
you
say
watson
that
the
lady
is
not
there
holmes
asked
when
had
finished
my
report
no
where
can
she
be
then
since
there
is
no
light
in
any
other
room
except
the
kitchen
cannot
think
where
she
is
have
said
that
over
the
great
grimpen
mire
there
hung
dense
white
fog
it
was
drifting
slowly
in
our
direction
and
banked
itself
up
like
wall
on
that
side
of
us
low
but
thick
and
well
defined
the
moon
shone
on
it
and
it
looked
like
great
shimmering
ice
field
with
the
heads
of
the
distant
tors
as
rocks
borne
upon
its
surface
holmes
face
was
turned
towards
it
and
he
muttered
impatiently
as
he
watched
its
sluggish
drift
it
moving
towards
us
watson
is
that
serious
very
serious
indeed
the
one
thing
upon
earth
which
could
have
disarranged
my
plans
he
can
be
very
long
now
it
is
already
ten
clock
our
success
and
even
his
life
may
depend
upon
his
coming
out
before
the
fog
is
over
the
path
the
night
was
clear
and
fine
above
us
the
stars
shone
cold
and
bright
while
half
moon
bathed
the
whole
scene
in
soft
uncertain
light
before
us
lay
the
dark
bulk
of
the
house
its
serrated
roof
and
bristling
chimneys
hard
outlined
against
the
silver
spangled
sky
broad
bars
of
golden
light
from
the
lower
windows
stretched
across
the
orchard
and
the
moor
one
of
them
was
suddenly
shut
off
the
servants
had
left
the
kitchen
there
only
remained
the
lamp
in
the
dining
room
where
the
two
men
the
murderous
host
and
the
unconscious
guest
still
chatted
over
their
cigars

every
minute
that
white
woolly
plain
which
covered
one
half
of
the
moor
was
drifting
closer
and
closer
to
the
house
already
the
first
thin
wisps
of
it
were
curling
across
the
golden
square
of
the
lighted
window
the
farther
wall
of
the
orchard
was
already
invisible
and
the
trees
were
standing
out
of
swirl
of
white
vapour
as
we
watched
it
the
fog
wreaths
came
crawling
round
both
corners
of
the
house
and
rolled
slowly
into
one
dense
bank
on
which
the
upper
floor
and
the
roof
floated
like
strange
ship
upon
shadowy
sea
holmes
struck
his
hand
passionately
upon
the
rock
in
front
of
us
and
stamped
his
feet
in
his
impatience
if
he
isn
out
in
quarter
of
an
hour
the
path
will
be
covered
in
half
an
hour
we
won
be
able
to
see
our
hands
in
front
of
us
shall
we
move
farther
back
upon
higher
ground
yes
think
it
would
be
as
well
so
as
the
fog
bank
flowed
onward
we
fell
back
before
it
until
we
were
half
mile
from
the
house
and
still
that
dense
white
sea
with
the
moon
silvering
its
upper
edge
swept
slowly
and
inexorably
on
we
are
going
too
far
said
holmes
we
dare
not
take
the
chance
of
his
being
overtaken
before
he
can
reach
us
at
all
costs
we
must
hold
our
ground
where
we
are
he
dropped
on
his
knees
and
clapped
his
ear
to
the
ground
thank
god
think
that
hear
him
coming
sound
of
quick
steps
broke
the
silence
of
the
moor
crouching
among
the
stones
we
stared
intently
at
the
silver
tipped
bank
in
front
of
us
the
steps
grew
louder
and
through
the
fog
as
through
curtain
there
stepped
the
man
whom
we
were
awaiting
he
looked
round
him
in
surprise
as
he
emerged
into
the
clear
starlit
night
then
he
came
swiftly
along
the
path
passed
close
to
where
we
lay
and
went
on
up
the
long
slope
behind
us
as
he
walked
he
glanced
continually
over
either
shoulder
like
man
who
is
ill
at
ease
hist
cried
holmes
and
heard
the
sharp
click
of
cocking
pistol
look
out
it
coming
there
was
thin
crisp
continuous
patter
from
somewhere
in
the
heart
of
that
crawling
bank
the
cloud
was
within
fifty
yards
of
where
we
lay
and
we
glared
at
it
all
three
uncertain
what
horror
was
about
to
break
from
the
heart
of
it
was
at
holmes
elbow
and
glanced
for
an
instant
at
his
face
it
was
pale
and
exultant
his
eyes
shining
brightly
in
the
moonlight
but
suddenly
they
started
forward
in
rigid
fixed
stare
and
his
lips
parted
in
amazement
at
the
same
instant
lestrade
gave
yell
of
terror
and
threw
himself
face
downward
upon
the
ground
sprang
to
my
feet
my
inert
hand
grasping
my
pistol
my
mind
paralyzed
by
the
dreadful
shape
which
had
sprung
out
upon
us
from
the
shadows
of
the
fog
hound
it
was
an
enormous
coal
black
hound
but
not
such
hound
as
mortal
eyes
have
ever
seen
fire
burst
from
its
open
mouth
its
eyes
glowed
with
smouldering
glare
its
muzzle
and
hackles
and
dewlap
were
outlined
in
flickering
flame
never
in
the
delirious
dream
of
disordered
brain
could
anything
more
savage
more
appalling
more
hellish
be
conceived
than
that
dark
form
and
savage
face
which
broke
upon
us
out
of
the
wall
of
fog
with
long
bounds
the
huge
black
creature
was
leaping
down
the
track
following
hard
upon
the
footsteps
of
our
friend
so
paralyzed
were
we
by
the
apparition
that
we
allowed
him
to
pass
before
we
had
recovered
our
nerve
then
holmes
and
both
fired
together
and
the
creature
gave
hideous
howl
which
showed
that
one
at
least
had
hit
him
he
did
not
pause
however
but
bounded
onward
far
away
on
the
path
we
saw
sir
henry
looking
back
his
face
white
in
the
moonlight
his
hands
raised
in
horror
glaring
helplessly
at
the
frightful
thing
which
was
hunting
him
down
but
that
cry
of
pain
from
the
hound
had
blown
all
our
fears
to
the
winds
if
he
was
vulnerable
he
was
mortal
and
if
we
could
wound
him
we
could
kill
him
never
have
seen
man
run
as
holmes
ran
that
night
am
reckoned
fleet
of
foot
but
he
outpaced
me
as
much
as
outpaced
the
little
professional
in
front
of
us
as
we
flew
up
the
track
we
heard
scream
after
scream
from
sir
henry
and
the
deep
roar
of
the
hound
was
in
time
to
see
the
beast
spring
upon
its
victim
hurl
him
to
the
ground
and
worry
at
his
throat
but
the
next
instant
holmes
had
emptied
five
barrels
of
his
revolver
into
the
creature
flank
with
last
howl
of
agony
and
vicious
snap
in
the
air
it
rolled
upon
its
back
four
feet
pawing
furiously
and
then
fell
limp
upon
its
side
stooped
panting
and
pressed
my
pistol
to
the
dreadful
shimmering
head
but
it
was
useless
to
press
the
trigger
the
giant
hound
was
dead
sir
henry
lay
insensible
where
he
had
fallen
we
tore
away
his
collar
and
holmes
breathed
prayer
of
gratitude
when
we
saw
that
there
was
no
sign
of
wound
and
that
the
rescue
had
been
in
time
already
our
friend
eyelids
shivered
and
he
made
feeble
effort
to
move
lestrade
thrust
his
brandy
flask
between
the
baronet
teeth
and
two
frightened
eyes
were
looking
up
at
us
my
god
he
whispered
what
was
it
what
in
heaven
name
was
it
dead
whatever
it
is
said
holmes
we
ve
laid
the
family
ghost
once
and
for
ever
in
mere
size
and
strength
it
was
terrible
creature
which
was
lying
stretched
before
us
it
was
not
pure
bloodhound
and
it
was
not
pure
mastiff
but
it
appeared
to
be
combination
of
the
two
gaunt
savage
and
as
large
as
small
lioness
even
now
in
the
stillness
of
death
the
huge
jaws
seemed
to
be
dripping
with
bluish
flame
and
the
small
deep
set
cruel
eyes
were
ringed
with
fire
placed
my
hand
upon
the
glowing
muzzle
and
as
held
them
up
my
own
fingers
smouldered
and
gleamed
in
the
darkness
phosphorus
said
cunning
preparation
of
it
said
holmes
sniffing
at
the
dead
animal
there
is
no
smell
which
might
have
interfered
with
his
power
of
scent
we
owe
you
deep
apology
sir
henry
for
having
exposed
you
to
this
fright
was
prepared
for
hound
but
not
for
such
creature
as
this
and
the
fog
gave
us
little
time
to
receive
him
you
have
saved
my
life
having
first
endangered
it
are
you
strong
enough
to
stand
give
me
another
mouthful
of
that
brandy
and
shall
be
ready
for
anything
so
now
if
you
will
help
me
up
what
do
you
propose
to
do
to
leave
you
here
you
are
not
fit
for
further
adventures
to
night
if
you
will
wait
one
or
other
of
us
will
go
back
with
you
to
the
hall
he
tried
to
stagger
to
his
feet
but
he
was
still
ghastly
pale
and
trembling
in
every
limb
we
helped
him
to
rock
where
he
sat
shivering
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
we
must
leave
you
now
said
holmes
the
rest
of
our
work
must
be
done
and
every
moment
is
of
importance
we
have
our
case
and
now
we
only
want
our
man
it
thousand
to
one
against
our
finding
him
at
the
house
he
continued
as
we
retraced
our
steps
swiftly
down
the
path
those
shots
must
have
told
him
that
the
game
was
up
we
were
some
distance
off
and
this
fog
may
have
deadened
them
he
followed
the
hound
to
call
him
off
of
that
you
may
be
certain
no
he
gone
by
this
time
but
we
ll
search
the
house
and
make
sure
the
front
door
was
open
so
we
rushed
in
and
hurried
from
room
to
room
to
the
amazement
of
doddering
old
manservant
who
met
us
in
the
passage
there
was
no
light
save
in
the
dining
room
but
holmes
caught
up
the
lamp
and
left
no
corner
of
the
house
unexplored
no
sign
could
we
see
of
the
man
whom
we
were
chasing
on
the
upper
floor
however
one
of
the
bedroom
doors
was
locked
there
someone
in
here
cried
lestrade
can
hear
movement
open
this
door
faint
moaning
and
rustling
came
from
within
holmes
struck
the
door
just
over
the
lock
with
the
flat
of
his
foot
and
it
flew
open
pistol
in
hand
we
all
three
rushed
into
the
room
but
there
was
no
sign
within
it
of
that
desperate
and
defiant
villain
whom
we
expected
to
see
instead
we
were
faced
by
an
object
so
strange
and
so
unexpected
that
we
stood
for
moment
staring
at
it
in
amazement
the
room
had
been
fashioned
into
small
museum
and
the
walls
were
lined
by
number
of
glass
topped
cases
full
of
that

the
formation
of
which
had
been
the
relaxation
of
this
complex
and
dangerous
man
in
the
centre
of
this
room
there
was
an
upright
beam
which
had
been
placed
at
some
period
as
support
for
the
old
worm
eaten
baulk
of
timber
which
spanned
the
roof
to
this
post
figure
was
tied
so
swathed
and
muffled
in
the
sheets
which
had
been
used
to
secure
it
that
one
could
not
for
the
moment
tell
whether
it
was
that
of
man
or
woman
one
towel
passed
round
the
throat
and
was
secured
at
the
back
of
the
pillar
another
covered
the
lower
part
of
the
face
and
over
it
two
dark
eyes
full
of
grief
and
shame
and
dreadful
questioning
stared
back
at
us
in
minute
we
had
torn
off
the
gag
unswathed
the
bonds
and
mrs
stapleton
sank
upon
the
floor
in
front
of
us
as
her
beautiful
head
fell
upon
her
chest
saw
the
clear
red
weal
of
whiplash
across
her
neck

the
brute
cried
holmes
here
lestrade
your
brandy
bottle
put
her
in
the
chair
she
has
fainted
from
ill
usage
and
exhaustion
she
opened
her
eyes
again
is
he
safe
she
asked
has
he
escaped
he
cannot
escape
us
madam
no
did
not
mean
my
husband
sir
henry
is
he
safe
yes
and
the
hound
it
is
dead
she
gave
long
sigh
of
satisfaction
thank
god
thank
god
oh
this
villain
see
how
he
has
treated
me
she
shot
her
arms
out
from
her
sleeves
and
we
saw
with
horror
that
they
were
all
mottled
with
bruises
but
this
is
nothing
it
is
my
mind
and
soul
that
he
has
tortured
and
defiled
could
endure
it
all
ill
usage
solitude
life
of
deception
everything
as
long
as
could
still
cling
to
the
hope
that
had
his
love
but
now
know
that
in
this
also
have
been
his
dupe
and
his
tool
she
broke
into
passionate
sobbing
as
she
spoke
you
bear
him
no
good
will
madam
said
holmes
tell
us
then
where
we
shall
find
him
if
you
have
ever
aided
him
in
evil
help
us
now
and
so
atone
there
is
but
one
place
where
he
can
have
fled
she
answered
there
is
an
old
tin
mine
on
an
island
in
the
heart
of
the
mire
it
was
there
that
he
kept
his
hound
and
there
also
he
had
made
preparations
so
that
he
might
have
refuge
that
is
where
he
would
fly
the
fog
bank
lay
like
white
wool
against
the
window
holmes
held
the
lamp
towards
it
see
said
he
no
one
could
find
his
way
into
the
grimpen
mire
to
night
she
laughed
and
clapped
her
hands
her
eyes
and
teeth
gleamed
with
fierce
merriment
he
may
find
his
way
in
but
never
out
she
cried
how
can
he
see
the
guiding
wands
to
night
we
planted
them
together
he
and
to
mark
the
pathway
through
the
mire
oh
if
could
only
have
plucked
them
out
to
day
then
indeed
you
would
have
had
him
at
your
mercy
it
was
evident
to
us
that
all
pursuit
was
in
vain
until
the
fog
had
lifted
meanwhile
we
left
lestrade
in
possession
of
the
house
while
holmes
and
went
back
with
the
baronet
to
baskerville
hall
the
story
of
the
stapletons
could
no
longer
be
withheld
from
him
but
he
took
the
blow
bravely
when
he
learned
the
truth
about
the
woman
whom
he
had
loved
but
the
shock
of
the
night
adventures
had
shattered
his
nerves
and
before
morning
he
lay
delirious
in
high
fever
under
the
care
of
dr
mortimer
the
two
of
them
were
destined
to
travel
together
round
the
world
before
sir
henry
had
become
once
more
the
hale
hearty
man
that
he
had
been
before
he
became
master
of
that
ill
omened
estate
and
now
come
rapidly
to
the
conclusion
of
this
singular
narrative
in
which
have
tried
to
make
the
reader
share
those
dark
fears
and
vague
surmises
which
clouded
our
lives
so
long
and
ended
in
so
tragic
manner
on
the
morning
after
the
death
of
the
hound
the
fog
had
lifted
and
we
were
guided
by
mrs
stapleton
to
the
point
where
they
had
found
pathway
through
the
bog
it
helped
us
to
realize
the
horror
of
this
woman
life
when
we
saw
the
eagerness
and
joy
with
which
she
laid
us
on
her
husband
track
we
left
her
standing
upon
the
thin
peninsula
of
firm
peaty
soil
which
tapered
out
into
the
widespread
bog
from
the
end
of
it
small
wand
planted
here
and
there
showed
where
the
path
zigzagged
from
tuft
to
tuft
of
rushes
among
those
green
scummed
pits
and
foul
quagmires
which
barred
the
way
to
the
stranger
rank
reeds
and
lush
slimy
water
plants
sent
an
odour
of
decay
and
heavy
miasmatic
vapour
onto
our
faces
while
false
step
plunged
us
more
than
once
thigh
deep
into
the
dark
quivering
mire
which
shook
for
yards
in
soft
undulations
around
our
feet
its
tenacious
grip
plucked
at
our
heels
as
we
walked
and
when
we
sank
into
it
was
as
if
some
malignant
hand
was
tugging
us
down
into
those
obscene
depths
so
grim
and
purposeful
was
the
clutch
in
which
it
held
us
once
only
we
saw
trace
that
someone
had
passed
that
perilous
way
before
us
from
amid
tuft
of
cotton
grass
which
bore
it
up
out
of
the
slime
some
dark
thing
was
projecting
holmes
sank
to
his
waist
as
he
stepped
from
the
path
to
seize
it
and
had
we
not
been
there
to
drag
him
out
he
could
never
have
set
his
foot
upon
firm
land
again
he
held
an
old
black
boot
in
the
air
meyers

printed
on
the
leather
inside
it
is
worth

bath
said
he
it
is
our
friend
sir
henry
missing
boot
thrown
there
by
stapleton
in
his
flight
exactly
he
retained
it
in
his
hand
after
using
it
to
set
the
hound
upon
the
track
he
fled
when
he
knew
the
game
was
up
still
clutching
it
and
he
hurled
it
away
at
this
point
of
his
flight
we
know
at
least
that
he
came
so
far
in
safety
but
more
than
that
we
were
never
destined
to
know
though
there
was
much
which
we
might
surmise
there
was
no
chance
of
finding
footsteps
in
the
mire
for
the
rising
mud
oozed
swiftly
in
upon
them
but
as
we
at
last
reached
firmer
ground
beyond
the
morass
we
all
looked
eagerly
for
them
but
no
slightest
sign
of
them
ever
met
our
eyes
if
the
earth
told
true
story
then
stapleton
never
reached
that
island
of
refuge
towards
which
he
struggled
through
the
fog
upon
that
last
night
somewhere
in
the
heart
of
the
great
grimpen
mire
down
in
the
foul
slime
of
the
huge
morass
which
had
sucked
him
in
this
cold
and
cruel
hearted
man
is
forever
buried
many
traces
we
found
of
him
in
the

where
he
had
hid

beside

of

driven
away
no
doubt
by
the

reek
of

surrounding

said
holmes
by
jove
curly
haired
spaniel
poor
mortimer
will
never
see
his
pet
again
well
do
not
know
that
this
place
contains
any
secret
which
we
have
not
already
fathomed
he
could
hide
his
hound
but
he
could
not
hush
its
voice
and
hence
came
those
cries
which
even
in
daylight
were
not
pleasant
to
hear
on
an
emergency
he
could
keep
the
hound
in
the
out
house
at
merripit
but
it
was
always
risk
and
it
was
only
on
the
supreme
day
which
he
regarded
as
the
end
of
all
his
efforts
that
he
dared
do
it
this
paste
in
the
tin
is
no
doubt
the
luminous
mixture
with
which
the
creature
was
daubed
it
was
suggested
of
course
by
the
story
of
the
family
hell
hound
and
by
the
desire
to
frighten
old
sir
charles
to
death
no
wonder
the
poor
devil
of
convict
ran
and
screamed
even
as
our
friend
did
and
as
we
ourselves
might
have
done
when
he
saw
such
creature
bounding
through
the
darkness
of
the
moor
upon
his
track
it
was
cunning
device
for
apart
from
the
chance
of
driving
your
victim
to
his
death
what
peasant
would
venture
to
inquire
too
closely
into
such
creature
should
he
get
sight
of
it
as
many
have
done
upon
the
moor
said
it
in
london
watson
and
say
it
again
now
that
never
yet
have
we
helped
to
hunt
down
more
dangerous
man
than
he
who
is
lying
yonder
he
swept
his
long
arm
towards
the
huge
mottled
expanse
of
green
splotched
bog
which
stretched
away
until
it
merged
into
the
russet
slopes
of
the
moor
xv
retrospection
it
was
the
end
of
november
and
holmes
and
sat
upon
raw
and
foggy
night
on
either
side
of
blazing
fire
in
our
sitting
room
in
baker
street
since
the
tragic
upshot
of
our
visit
to
devonshire
he
had
been
engaged
in
two
affairs
of
the
utmost
importance
in
the
first
of
which
he
had
exposed
the
atrocious
conduct
of
colonel
upwood
in
connection
with
the
famous
card
scandal
of
the
nonpareil
club
while
in
the
second
he
had
defended
the
unfortunate
mme
montpensier
from
the
charge
of
murder
which
hung
over
her
in
connection
with
the
death
of
her
step
daughter
mlle
carere
the
young
lady
who
as
it
will
be
remembered
was
found
six
months
later
alive
and
married
in
new
york
my
friend
was
in
excellent
spirits
over
the
success
which
had
attended
succession
of
difficult
and
important
cases
so
that
was
able
to
induce
him
to
discuss
the
details
of
the
baskerville
mystery
had
waited
patiently
for
the
opportunity
for
was
aware
that
he
would
never
permit
cases
to
overlap
and
that
his
clear
and
logical
mind
would
not
be
drawn
from
its
present
work
to
dwell
upon
memories
of
the
past
sir
henry
and
dr
mortimer
were
however
in
london
on
their
way
to
that
long
voyage
which
had
been
recommended
for
the
restoration
of
his
shattered
nerves
they
had
called
upon
us
that
very
afternoon
so
that
it
was
natural
that
the
subject
should
come
up
for
discussion
the
whole
course
of
events
said
holmes
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
man
who
called
himself
stapleton
was
simple
and
direct
although
to
us
who
had
no
means
in
the
beginning
of
knowing
the
motives
of
his
actions
and
could
only
learn
part
of
the
facts
it
all
appeared
exceedingly
complex
have
had
the
advantage
of
two
conversations
with
mrs
stapleton
and
the
case
has
now
been
so
entirely
cleared
up
that
am
not
aware
that
there
is
anything
which
has
remained
secret
to
us
you
will
find
few
notes
upon
the
matter
under
the
heading
in
my
indexed
list
of
cases
it
was
very
essential
for
stapleton
to
get
some
article
of
sir
henry
attire
so
that
in
case
he
was
driven
to
use
the
dog
he
might
always
have
the
means
of
setting
him
upon
his
track
with
characteristic
promptness
and
audacity
he
set
about
this
at
once
and
we
cannot
doubt
that
the
boots
or
chamber
maid
of
the
hotel
was
well
bribed
to
help
him
in
his
design
by
chance
however
the
first
boot
which
was
procured
for
him
was
new
one
and
therefore
useless
for
his
purpose
he
then
had
it
returned
and
obtained
another
most
instructive
incident
since
it
proved
conclusively
to
my
mind
that
we
were
dealing
with
real
hound
as
no
other
supposition
could
explain
this
anxiety
to
obtain
an
old
boot
and
this
indifference
to
new
one
the
more
outré
and
grotesque
an
incident
is
the
more
carefully
it
deserves
to
be
examined
and
the
very
point
which
appears
to
complicate
case
is
when
duly
considered
and
scientifically
handled
the
one
which
is
most
likely
to
elucidate
it
then
we
had
the
visit
from
our
friends
next
morning
shadowed
always
by
stapleton
in
the
cab
from
his
knowledge
of
our
rooms
and
of
my
appearance
as
well
as
from
his
general
conduct
am
inclined
to
think
that
stapleton
career
of
crime
has
been
by
no
means
limited
to
this
single
baskerville
affair
it
is
suggestive
that
during
the
last
three
years
there
have
been
four
considerable
burglaries
in
the
west
country
for
none
of
which
was
any
criminal
ever
arrested
the
last
of
these
at
folkestone
court
in
may
was
remarkable
for
the
cold
blooded
pistoling
of
the
page
who
surprised
the
masked
and
solitary
burglar
cannot
doubt
that
stapleton
recruited
his
waning
resources
in
this
fashion
and
that
for
years
he
has
been
desperate
and
dangerous
man
we
had
an
example
of
his
readiness
of
resource
that
morning
when
he
got
away
from
us
so
successfully
and
also
of
his
audacity
in
sending
back
my
own
name
to
me
through
the
cabman
from
that
moment
he
understood
that
had
taken
over
the
case
in
london
and
that
therefore
there
was
no
chance
for
him
there
he
returned
to
dartmoor
and
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
baronet
one
moment
said
you
have
no
doubt
described
the
sequence
of
events
correctly
but
there
is
one
point
which
you
have
left
unexplained
what
became
of
the
hound
when
its
master
was
in
london
have
given
some
attention
to
this
matter
and
it
is
undoubtedly
of
importance
there
can
be
no
question
that
stapleton
had
confidant
though
it
is
unlikely
that
he
ever
placed
himself
in
his
power
by
sharing
all
his
plans
with
him
there
was
an
old
manservant
at
merripit
house
whose
name
was
anthony
his
connection
with
the
stapletons
can
be
traced
for
several
years
as
far
back
as
the
schoolmastering
days
so
that
he
must
have
been
aware
that
his
master
and
mistress
were
really
husband
and
wife
this
man
has
disappeared
and
has
escaped
from
the
country
it
is
suggestive
that
anthony
is
not
common
name
in
england
while
antonio
is
so
in
all
spanish
or
spanish
american
countries
the
man
like
mrs
stapleton
herself
spoke
good
english
but
with
curious
lisping
accent
have
myself
seen
this
old
man
cross
the
grimpen
mire
by
the
path
which
stapleton
had
marked
out
it
is
very
probable
therefore
that
in
the
absence
of
his
master
it
was
he
who
cared
for
the
hound
though
he
may
never
have
known
the
purpose
for
which
the
beast
was
used
the
stapletons
then
went
down
to
devonshire
whither
they
were
soon
followed
by
sir
henry
and
you
one
word
now
as
to
how
stood
myself
at
that
time
it
may
possibly
recur
to
your
memory
that
when
examined
the
paper
upon
which
the
printed
words
were
fastened
made
close
inspection
for
the
water
mark
in
doing
so
held
it
within
few
inches
of
my
eyes
and
was
conscious
of
faint
smell
of
the
scent
known
as
white
jessamine
there
are
seventy
five
perfumes
which
it
is
very
necessary
that
criminal
expert
should
be
able
to
distinguish
from
each
other
and
cases
have
more
than
once
within
my
own
experience
depended
upon
their
prompt
recognition
the
scent
suggested
the
presence
of
lady
and
already
my
thoughts
began
to
turn
towards
the
stapletons
thus
had
made
certain
of
the
hound
and
had
guessed
at
the
criminal
before
ever
we
went
to
the
west
country
it
was
my
game
to
watch
stapleton
it
was
evident
however
that
could
not
do
this
if
were
with
you
since
he
would
be
keenly
on
his
guard
deceived
everybody
therefore
yourself
included
and
came
down
secretly
when
was
supposed
to
be
in
london
my
hardships
were
not
so
great
as
you
imagined
though
such
trifling
details
must
never
interfere
with
the
investigation
of
case
stayed
for
the
most
part
at
coombe
tracey
and
only
used
the
hut
upon
the
moor
when
it
was
necessary
to
be
near
the
scene
of
action
cartwright
had
come
down
with
me
and
in
his
disguise
as
country
boy
he
was
of
great
assistance
to
me
was
dependent
upon
him
for
food
and
clean
linen
when
was
watching
stapleton
cartwright
was
frequently
watching
you
so
that
was
able
to
keep
my
hand
upon
all
the
strings
have
already
told
you
that
your
reports
reached
me
rapidly
being
forwarded
instantly
from
baker
street
to
coombe
tracey
they
were
of
great
service
to
me
and
especially
that
one
incidentally
truthful
piece
of
biography
of
stapleton
was
able
to
establish
the
identity
of
the
man
and
the
woman
and
knew
at
last
exactly
how
stood
the
case
had
been
considerably
complicated
through
the
incident
of
the
escaped
convict
and
the
relations
between
him
and
the
barrymores
this
also
you
cleared
up
in
very
effective
way
though
had
already
come
to
the
same
conclusions
from
my
own
observations
by
the
time
that
you
discovered
me
upon
the
moor
had
complete
knowledge
of
the
whole
business
but
had
not
case
which
could
go
to
jury
even
stapleton
attempt
upon
sir
henry
that
night
which
ended
in
the
death
of
the
unfortunate
convict
did
not
help
us
much
in
proving
murder
against
our
man
there
seemed
to
be
no
alternative
but
to
catch
him
red
handed
and
to
do
so
we
had
to
use
sir
henry
alone
and
apparently
unprotected
as
bait
we
did
so
and
at
the
cost
of
severe
shock
to
our
client
we
succeeded
in
completing
our
case
and
driving
stapleton
to
his
destruction
that
sir
henry
should
have
been
exposed
to
this
is
must
confess
reproach
to
my
management
of
the
case
but
we
had
no
means
of
foreseeing
the
terrible
and
paralyzing
spectacle
which
the
beast
presented
nor
could
we
predict
the
fog
which
enabled
him
to
burst
upon
us
at
such
short
notice
we
succeeded
in
our
object
at
cost
which
both
the
specialist
and
dr
mortimer
assure
me
will
be
temporary
one
long
journey
may
enable
our
friend
to
recover
not
only
from
his
shattered
nerves
but
also
from
his
wounded
feelings
his
love
for
the
lady
was
deep
and
sincere
and
to
him
the
saddest
part
of
all
this
black
business
was
that
he
should
have
been
deceived
by
her
it
only
remains
to
indicate
the
part
which
she
had
played
throughout
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
stapleton
exercised
an
influence
over
her
which
may
have
been
love
or
may
have
been
fear
or
very
possibly
both
since
they
are
by
no
means
incompatible
emotions
it
was
at
least
absolutely
effective
at
his
command
she
consented
to
pass
as
his
sister
though
he
found
the
limits
of
his
power
over
her
when
he
endeavoured
to
make
her
the
direct
accessory
to
murder
she
was
ready
to
warn
sir
henry
so
far
as
she
could
without
implicating
her
husband
and
again
and
again
she
tried
to
do
so
stapleton
himself
seems
to
have
been
capable
of
jealousy
and
when
he
saw
the
baronet
paying
court
to
the
lady
even
though
it
was
part
of
his
own
plan
still
he
could
not
help
interrupting
with
passionate
outburst
which
revealed
the
fiery
soul
which
his
self
contained
manner
so
cleverly
concealed
by
encouraging
the
intimacy
he
made
it
certain
that
sir
henry
would
frequently
come
to
merripit
house
and
that
he
would
sooner
or
later
get
the
opportunity
which
he
desired
on
the
day
of
the
crisis
however
his
wife
turned
suddenly
against
him
she
had
learned
something
of
the
death
of
the
convict
and
she
knew
that
the
hound
was
being
kept
in
the
out
house
on
the
evening
that
sir
henry
was
coming
to
dinner
she
taxed
her
husband
with
his
intended
crime
and
furious
scene
followed
in
which
he
showed
her
for
the
first
time
that
she
had
rival
in
his
love
her
fidelity
turned
in
an
instant
to
bitter
hatred
and
he
saw
that
she
would
betray
him
he
tied
her
up
therefore
that
she
might
have
no
chance
of
warning
sir
henry
and
he
hoped
no
doubt
that
when
the
whole
countryside
put
down
the
baronet
death
to
the
curse
of
his
family
as
they
certainly
would
do
he
could
win
his
wife
back
to
accept
an
accomplished
fact
and
to
keep
silent
upon
what
she
knew
in
this
fancy
that
in
any
case
he
made
miscalculation
and
that
if
we
had
not
been
there
his
doom
would
none
the
less
have
been
sealed
woman
of
spanish
blood
does
not
condone
such
an
injury
so
lightly
and
now
my
dear
watson
without
referring
to
my
notes
cannot
give
you
more
detailed
account
of
this
curious
case
do
not
know
that
anything
essential
has
been
left
unexplained

he
could
not
hope
to
frighten
sir
henry
to
death
as
he
had
done
the
old
uncle
with
his
bogy
hound
the
beast
was
savage
and
half
starved
if
its
appearance
did
not
frighten
its
victim
to
death
at
least
it
would
paralyze
the
resistance
which
might
be
offered
no
doubt
there
only
remains
one
difficulty
if
stapleton
came
into
the
succession
how
could
he
explain
the
fact
that
he
the
heir
had
been
living
unannounced
under
another
name
so
close
to
the
property
how
could
he
claim
it
without
causing
suspicion
and
inquiry
it
is
formidable
difficulty
and
fear
that
you
ask
too
much
when
you
expect
me
to
solve
it
the
past
and
the
present
are
within
the
field
of
my
inquiry
but
what
man
may
do
in
the
future
is
hard
question
to
answer
mrs
stapleton
has
heard
her
husband
discuss
the
problem
on
several
occasions
there
were
three
possible
courses
he
might
claim
the
property
from
south
america
establish
his
identity
before
the
british
authorities
there
and
so
obtain
the
fortune
without
ever
coming
to
england
at
all
or
he
might
adopt
an
elaborate
disguise
during
the
short
time
that
he
need
be
in
london
or
again
he
might
furnish
an
accomplice
with
the
proofs
and
papers
putting
him
in
as
heir
and
retaining
claim
upon
some
proportion
of
his
income
we
cannot
doubt
from
what
we
know
of
him
that
he
would
have
found
some
way
out
of
the
difficulty
and
now
my
dear
watson
we
have
had
some
weeks
of
severe
work
and
for
one
evening
think
we
may
turn
our
thoughts
into
more
pleasant
channels
have
box

les
huguenots
have
you
heard
the

trouble
you

am
inclined
to
think

should
do
so
sherlock
holmes
remarked
impatiently
believe
that
am
one
of
the
most
long
suffering
of
mortals
but
ll
admit
that
was
annoyed
at
the
sardonic
interruption
really
holmes
said
severely
you
are
little
trying
at
times
he
was
too
much
absorbed
with
his
own
thoughts
to
give
any
immediate
answer
to
my
remonstrance
he
leaned
upon
his
hand
with
his
untasted
breakfast
before
him
and
he
stared
at
the
slip
of
paper
which
he
had
just
drawn
from
its
envelope
then
he
took
the
envelope
itself
held
it
up
to
the
light
and
very
carefully
studied
both
the
exterior
and
the
flap
it
is
porlock
writing
said
he
thoughtfully
can
hardly
doubt
that
it
is
porlock
writing
though
have
seen
it
only
twice
before
the
greek
with
the
peculiar
top
flourish
is
distinctive
but
if
it
is
porlock
then
it
must
be
something
of
the
very
first
importance
he
was
speaking
to
himself
rather
than
to
me
but
my
vexation
disappeared
in
the
interest
which
the
words
awakened
who
then
is
porlock
asked
porlock
watson
is
nom
de
plume
mere
identification
mark
but
behind
it
lies
shifty
and
evasive
personality
in
former
letter
he
frankly
informed
me
that
the
name
was
not
his
own
and
defied
me
ever
to
trace
him
among
the
teeming
millions
of
this
great
city
porlock
is
important
not
for
himself
but
for
the
great
man
with
whom
he
is
in
touch
picture
to
yourself
the
pilot
fish
with
the
shark
the
jackal
with
the
lion
anything
that
is
insignificant
in
companionship
with
what
is
formidable
not
only
formidable
watson
but
sinister
in
the
highest
degree
sinister
that
is
where
he
comes
within
my
purview
you
have
heard
me
speak
of
professor
moriarty
the
famous
scientific
criminal
as
famous
among
crooks
as
my
blushes
watson
holmes
murmured
in
deprecating
voice
was
about
to
say
as
he
is
unknown
to
the
public
touch
distinct
touch
cried
holmes
you
are
developing
certain
unexpected
vein
of
pawky
humour
watson
against
which
must
learn
to
guard
myself
but
in
calling
moriarty
criminal
you
are
uttering
libel
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
and
there
lie
the
glory
and
the
wonder
of
it
the
greatest
schemer
of
all
time
the
organizer
of
every
deviltry
the
controlling
brain
of
the
underworld
brain
which
might
have
made
or
marred
the
destiny
of
nations
that
the
man
but
so
aloof
is
he
from
general
suspicion
so
immune
from
criticism
so
admirable
in
his
management
and
self
effacement
that
for
those
very
words
that
you
have
uttered
he
could
hale
you
to
court
and
emerge
with
your
year
pension
as
solatium
for
his
wounded
character
is
he
not
the
celebrated
author
of
the
dynamics
of
an
asteroid
book
which
ascends
to
such
rarefied
heights
of
pure
mathematics
that
it
is
said
that
there
was
no
man
in
the
scientific
press
capable
of
criticizing
it
is
this
man
to
traduce
foulmouthed
doctor
and
slandered
professor
such
would
be
your
respective
roles
that
genius
watson
but
if
am
spared
by
lesser
men
our
day
will
surely
come
may
be
there
to
see
exclaimed
devoutly
but
you
were
speaking
of
this
man
porlock
ah
yes
the
so
called
porlock
is
link
in
the
chain
some
little
way
from
its
great
attachment
porlock
is
not
quite
sound
link
between
ourselves
he
is
the
only
flaw
in
that
chain
so
far
as
have
been
able
to
test
it
but
no
chain
is
stronger
than
its
weakest
link
exactly
my
dear
watson
hence
the
extreme
importance
of
porlock
led
on
by
some
rudimentary
aspirations
towards
right
and
encouraged
by
the
judicious
stimulation
of
an
occasional
ten
pound
note
sent
to
him
by
devious
methods
he
has
once
or
twice
given
me
advance
information
which
has
been
of
value
that
highest
value
which
anticipates
and
prevents
rather
than
avenges
crime
cannot
doubt
that
if
we
had
the
cipher
we
should
find
that
this
communication
is
of
the
nature
that
indicate
again
holmes
flattened
out
the
paper
upon
his
unused
plate
rose
and
leaning
over
him
stared
down
at
the
curious
inscription
which
ran
as

what
do
you
make
of
it
holmes
it
is
obviously
an
attempt
to
convey
secret
information
but
what
is
the
use
of
cipher
message
without
the
cipher
in
this
instance
none
at
all
why
do
you
say
in
this
instance
because
there
are
many
ciphers
which
would
read
as
easily
as
do
the
apocrypha
of
the
agony
column
such
crude
devices
amuse
the
intelligence
without
fatiguing
it
but
this
is
different
it
is
clearly
reference
to
the
words
in
page
of
some
book
until
am
told
which
page
and
which
book
am
powerless
but
why
douglas
and
birlstone
clearly
because
those
are
words
which
were
not
contained
in
the
page
in
question
then
why
has
he
not
indicated
the
book
your
native
shrewdness
my
dear
watson
that
innate
cunning
which
is
the
delight
of
your
friends
would
surely
prevent
you
from
inclosing
cipher
and
message
in
the
same
envelope
should
it
miscarry
you
are
undone
as
it
is
both
have
to
go
wrong
before
any
harm
comes
from
it
our
second
post
is
now
overdue
and
shall
be
surprised
if
it
does
not
bring
us
either
further
letter
of
explanation
or
as
is
more
probable
the
very
volume
to
which
these
figures
refer
holmes
calculation
was
fulfilled
within
very
few
minutes
by
the
appearance
of
billy
the
page
with
the
very
letter
which
we
were
expecting
the
same
writing
remarked
holmes
as
he
opened
the
envelope
and
actually
signed
he
added
in
an
exultant
voice
as
he
unfolded
the
epistle
come
we
are
getting
on
watson
his
brow
clouded
however
as
he
glanced
over
the
contents
dear
me
this
is
very
disappointing
fear
watson
that
all
our
expectations
come
to
nothing
trust
that
the
man
porlock
will
come
to
no
harm
dear
mr
holmes
he
says
will
go
no
further
in
this
matter
it
is
too
dangerous
he
suspects
me
can
see
that
he
suspects
me
he
came
to
me
quite
unexpectedly
after
had
actually
addressed
this
envelope
with
the
intention
of
sending
you
the
key
to
the
cipher
was
able
to
cover
it
up
if
he
had
seen
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
me
but
read
suspicion
in
his
eyes
please
burn
the
cipher
message
which
can
now
be
of
no
use
to
you
fred
porlock
holmes
sat
for
some
little
time
twisting
this
letter
between
his
fingers
and
frowning
as
he
stared
into
the
fire
after
all
he
said
at
last
there
may
be
nothing
in
it
may
be
only
his
guilty
conscience
knowing
himself
to
be
traitor
he
may
have
read
the
accusation
in
the
other
eyes
the
other
being
presume
professor
moriarty
no
less
when
any
of
that
party
talk
about
he
you
know
whom
they
mean
there
is
one
predominant
he
for
all
of
them

but
what
can
he
do
hum
that
large
question
when
you
have
one
of
the
first
brains
of
europe
up
against
you
and
all
the
powers
of
darkness
at
his
back
there
are
infinite
possibilities
anyhow
friend
porlock
is
evidently
scared
out
of
his
senses
kindly
compare
the
writing
in
the
note
to
that
upon
its
envelope
which
was
done
he
tells
us
before
this
ill
omened
visit
the
one
is
clear
and
firm
the
other
hardly
legible
why
did
he
write
at
all
why
did
he
not
simply
drop
it
because
he
feared
would
make
some
inquiry
after
him
in
that
case
and
possibly
bring
trouble
on
him
no
doubt
said
of
course
had
picked
up
the
original
cipher
message
and
was
bending
my
brows
over
it
pretty
maddening
to
think
that
an
important
secret
may
lie
here
on
this
slip
of
paper
and
that
it
is
beyond
human
power
to
penetrate
it
sherlock
holmes
had
pushed
away
his
untasted
breakfast
and
lit
the
unsavoury
pipe
which
was
the
companion
of
his
deepest
meditations
wonder
said
he
leaning
back
and
staring
at
the
ceiling
perhaps
there
are
points
which
have
escaped
your
machiavellian
intellect
let
us
consider
the
problem
in
the
light
of
pure
reason
this
man
reference
is
to
book
that
is
our
point
of
departure
somewhat
vague
one
let
us
see
then
if
we
can
narrow
it
down
as
focus
my
mind
upon
it
seems
rather
less
impenetrable
what
indications
have
we
as
to
this
book
none
well
it
is
surely
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
the
cipher
message
begins
with
large
534
does
it
not
we
may
take
it
as
working
hypothesis
that
534
is
the
particular
page
to
which
the
cipher
refers
so
our
book
has
already
become
large
book
which
is
surely
something
gained
what
other
indications
have
we
as
to
the
nature
of
this
large
book
the
next
sign
is
c2
what
do
you
make
of
that
watson
chapter
the
second
no
doubt
hardly
that
watson
you
will
am
sure
agree
with
me
that
if
the
page
be
given
the
number
of
the
chapter
is
immaterial
also
that
if
page
534
finds
us
only
in
the
second
chapter
the
length
of
the
first
one
must
have
been
really
intolerable
column
cried
brilliant
watson
you
are
scintillating
this
morning
if
it
is
not
column
then
am
very
much
deceived
so
now
you
see
we
begin
to
visualize
large
book
printed
in
double
columns
which
are
each
of
considerable
length
since
one
of
the
words
is
numbered
in
the
document
as
the
two
hundred
and
ninetythird
have
we
reached
the
limits
of
what
reason
can
supply
fear
that
we
have
surely
you
do
yourself
an
injustice
one
more
coruscation
my
dear
watson
yet
another
brain
wave
had
the
volume
been
an
unusual
one
he
would
have
sent
it
to
me
instead
of
that
he
had
intended
before
his
plans
were
nipped
to
send
me
the
clue
in
this
envelope
he
says
so
in
his
note
this
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
book
is
one
which
he
thought
would
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
for
myself
he
had
it
and
he
imagined
that
would
have
it
too
in
short
watson
it
is
very
common
book
what
you
say
certainly
sounds
plausible
so
we
have
contracted
our
field
of
search
to
large
book
printed
in
double
columns
and
in
common
use
the
bible
cried
triumphantly
good
watson
good
but
not
if
may
say
so
quite
good
enough
even
if
accepted
the
compliment
for
myself
could
hardly
name
any
volume
which
would
be
less
likely
to
lie
at
the
elbow
of
one
of
moriarty
associates
besides
the
editions
of
holy
writ
are
so
numerous
that
he
could
hardly
suppose
that
two
copies
would
have
the
same
pagination
this
is
clearly
book
which
is
standardized
he
knows
for
certain
that
his
page
534
will
exactly
agree
with
my
page
534
but
very
few
books
would
correspond
with
that
exactly
therein
lies
our
salvation
our
search
is
narrowed
down
to
standardized
books
which
anyone
may
be
supposed
to
possess
bradshaw
there
are
difficulties
watson
the
vocabulary
of
bradshaw
is
nervous
and
terse
but
limited
the
selection
of
words
would
hardly
lend
itself
to
the
sending
of
general
messages
we
will
eliminate
bradshaw
the
dictionary
is
fear
inadmissible
for
the
same
reason
what
then
is
left
an
almanac
excellent
watson
am
very
much
mistaken
if
you
have
not
touched
the
spot
an
almanac
let
us
consider
the
claims
of
whitaker
almanac
it
is
in
common
use
it
has
the
requisite
number
of
pages
it
is
in
double
column
though
reserved
in
its
earlier
vocabulary
it
becomes
if
remember
right
quite
garrulous
towards
the
end
he
picked
the
volume
from
his
desk
here
is
page
534
column
two
substantial
block
of
print
dealing
perceive
with
the
trade
and
resources
of
british
india
jot
down
the
words
watson
number
thirteen
is
mahratta
not
fear
very
auspicious
beginning
number
one
hundred
and
twenty
seven
is
government
which
at
least
makes
sense
though
somewhat
irrelevant
to
ourselves
and
professor
moriarty
now
let
us
try
again
what
does
the
mahratta
government
do
alas
the
next
word
is
pig
bristles
we
are
undone
my
good
watson
it
is
finished
he
had
spoken
in
jesting
vein
but
the
twitching
of
his
bushy
eyebrows
bespoke
his
disappointment
and
irritation
sat
helpless
and
unhappy
staring
into
the
fire
long
silence
was
broken
by
sudden
exclamation
from
holmes
who
dashed
at
cupboard
from
which
he
emerged
with
second
yellow
covered
volume
in
his
hand
we
pay
the
price
watson
for
being
too
up
to
date
he
cried
we
are
before
our
time
and
suffer
the
usual
penalties
being
the
seventh
of
january
we
have
very
properly
laid
in
the
new
almanac
it
is
more
than
likely
that
porlock
took
his
message
from
the
old
one
no
doubt
he
would
have
told
us
so
had
his
letter
of
explanation
been
written
now
let
us
see
what
page
534
has
in
store
for
us
number
thirteen
is
there
which
is
much
more
promising
number
one
hundred
and
twenty
seven
is
there
is
holmes
eyes
were
gleaming
with
excitement
and
his
thin
nervous
fingers
twitched
as
he
counted
the
words
danger
ha
capital
put
that
down
watson
there
is
danger
may
come
very
soon
one
then
we
have
the
name
douglas
rich
country
now
at
birlstone
house
birlstone
confidence
is
pressing
there
watson
what
do
you
think
of
pure
reason
and
its
fruit
if
the
greengrocer
had
such
thing
as
laurel
wreath
should
send
billy
round
for
it
was
staring
at
the
strange
message
which
had
scrawled
as
he
deciphered
it
upon
sheet
of
foolscap
on
my
knee
what
queer
scrambling
way
of
expressing
his
meaning
said
on
the
contrary
he
has
done
quite
remarkably
well
said
holmes
when
you
search
single
column
for
words
with
which
to
express
your
meaning
you
can
hardly
expect
to
get
everything
you
want
you
are
bound
to
leave
something
to
the
intelligence
of
your
correspondent
the
purport
is
perfectly
clear
some
deviltry
is
intended
against
one
douglas
whoever
he
may
be
residing
as
stated
rich
country
gentleman
he
is
sure
confidence
was
as
near
as
he
could
get
to
confident
that
it
is
pressing
there
is
our
result
and
very
workmanlike
little
bit
of
analysis
it
was
holmes
had
the
impersonal
joy
of
the
true
artist
in
his
better
work
even
as
he
mourned
darkly
when
it
fell
below
the
high
level
to
which
he
aspired
he
was
still
chuckling
over
his
success
when
billy
swung
open
the
door
and
inspector
macDonald
of
scotland
yard
was
ushered
into
the
room
those
were
the
early
days
at
the
end
of
the
80
when
alec
macDonald
was
far
from
having
attained
the
national
fame
which
he
has
now
achieved
he
was
young
but
trusted
member
of
the
detective
force
who
had
distinguished
himself
in
several
cases
which
had
been
entrusted
to
him
his
tall
bony
figure
gave
promise
of
exceptional
physical
strength
while
his
great
cranium
and
deep
set
lustrous
eyes
spoke
no
less
clearly
of
the
keen
intelligence
which
twinkled
out
from
behind
his
bushy
eyebrows
he
was
silent
precise
man
with
dour
nature
and
hard
aberdonian
accent
twice
already
in
his
career
had
holmes
helped
him
to
attain
success
his
own
sole
reward
being
the
intellectual
joy
of
the
problem
for
this
reason
the
affection
and
respect
of
the
scotchman
for
his
amateur
colleague
were
profound
and
he
showed
them
by
the
frankness
with
which
he
consulted
holmes
in
every
difficulty
mediocrity
knows
nothing
higher
than
itself
but
talent
instantly
recognizes
genius
and
macDonald
had
talent
enough
for
his
profession
to
enable
him
to
perceive
that
there
was
no
humiliation
in
seeking
the
assistance
of
one
who
already
stood
alone
in
europe
both
in
his
gifts
and
in
his
experience
holmes
was
not
prone
to
friendship
but
he
was
tolerant
of
the
big
scotchman
and
smiled
at
the
sight
of
him
you
are
an
early
bird
mr
mac
said
he
wish
you
luck
with
your
worm
fear
this
means
that
there
is
some
mischief
afoot

if
you
said
hope
instead
of
fear
it
would
be
nearer
the
truth
thinking
mr
holmes
the
inspector
answered
with
knowing
grin
well
maybe
wee
nip
would
keep
out
the
raw
morning
chill
no
won
smoke
thank
you
ll
have
to
be
pushing
on
my
way
for
the
early
hours
of
case
are
the
precious
ones
as
no
man
knows
better
than
your
own
self
but
the
inspector
had
stopped
suddenly
and
was
staring
with
look
of
absolute
amazement
at
paper
upon
the
table
it
was
the
sheet
upon
which
had
scrawled
the
enigmatic
message
douglas
he
stammered
birlstone
what
this
mr
holmes
man
it
witchcraft
where
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
wonderful
did
you
get
those
names
it
is
cipher
that
dr
watson
and
have
had
occasion
to
solve
but
why
what
amiss
with
the
names
the
inspector
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
in
dazed
astonishment
just
this
said
he
that
mr
douglas
of
birlstone
manor
house
was
horribly
murdered
last
night
ii
sherlock
holmes
discourses
it
was
one
of
those
dramatic
moments
for
which
my
friend
existed
it
would
be
an
overstatement
to
say
that
he
was
shocked
or
even
excited
by
the
amazing
announcement
without
having
tinge
of
cruelty
in
his
singular
composition
he
was
undoubtedly
callous
from
long
over
stimulation
yet
if
his
emotions
were
dulled
his
intellectual
perceptions
were
exceedingly
active
there
was
no
trace
then
of
the
horror
which
had
myself
felt
at
this
curt
declaration
but
his
face
showed
rather
the
quiet
and
interested
composure
of
the
chemist
who
sees
the
crystals
falling
into
position
from
his
oversaturated
solution
remarkable
said
he
remarkable
you
don
seem
surprised
interested
mr
mac
but
hardly
surprised
why
should
be
surprised
receive
an
anonymous
communication
from
quarter
which
know
to
be
important
warning
me
that
danger
threatens
certain
person
within
an
hour
learn
that
this
danger
has
actually
materialized
and
that
the
person
is
dead
am
interested
but
as
you
observe
am
not
surprised
in
few
short
sentences
he
explained
to
the
inspector
the
facts
about
the
letter
and
the
cipher
macDonald
sat
with
his
chin
on
his
hands
and
his
great
sandy
eyebrows
bunched
into
yellow
tangle
was
going
down
to
birlstone
this
morning
said
he
had
come
to
ask
you
if
you
cared
to
come
with
me
you
and
your
friend
here
but
from
what
you
say
we
might
perhaps
be
doing
better
work
in
london
rather
think
not
said
holmes
hang
it
all
mr
holmes
cried
the
inspector
the
papers
will
be
full
of
the
birlstone
mystery
in
day
or
two
but
where
the
mystery
if
there
is
man
in
london
who
prophesied
the
crime
before
ever
it
occurred
we
have
only
to
lay
our
hands
on
that
man
and
the
rest
will
follow
no
doubt
mr
mac
but
how
do
you
propose
to
lay
your
hands
on
the
so
called
porlock
macDonald
turned
over
the
letter
which
holmes
had
handed
him
posted
in
camberwell
that
doesn
help
us
much
name
you
say
is
assumed
not
much
to
go
on
certainly
didn
you
say
that
you
have
sent
him
money
twice
and
how
in
notes
to
camberwell
post
office
did
you
ever
trouble
to
see
who
called
for
them
no
the
inspector
looked
surprised
and
little
shocked
why
not
because
always
keep
faith
had
promised
when
he
first
wrote
that
would
not
try
to
trace
him
you
think
there
is
someone
behind
him
know
there
is
this
professor
that
ve
heard
you
mention
exactly
inspector
macDonald
smiled
and
his
eyelid
quivered
as
he
glanced
towards
me
won
conceal
from
you
mr
holmes
that
we
think
in
the
that
you
have
wee
bit
of
bee
in
your
bonnet
over
this
professor
made
some
inquiries
myself
about
the
matter
he
seems
to
be
very
respectable
learned
and
talented
sort
of
man
glad
you
ve
got
so
far
as
to
recognize
the
talent
man
you
can
but
recognize
it
after
heard
your
view
made
it
my
business
to
see
him
had
chat
with
him
on
eclipses
how
the
talk
got
that
way
canna
think
but
he
had
out
reflector
lantern
and
globe
and
made
it
all
clear
in
minute
he
lent
me
book
but
don
mind
saying
that
it
was
bit
above
my
head
though
had
good
aberdeen
upbringing
he
have
made
grand
meenister
with
his
thin
face
and
grey
hair
and
solemn
like
way
of
talking
when
he
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
as
we
were
parting
it
was
like
father
blessing
before
you
go
out
into
the
cold
cruel
world
holmes
chuckled
and
rubbed
his
hands
great
he
said
great
tell
me
friend
macDonald
this
pleasing
and
touching
interview
was
suppose
in
the
professor
study
that
so
fine
room
is
it
not
very
fine
very
handsome
indeed
mr
holmes
you
sat
in
front
of
his
writing
desk
just
so
sun
in
your
eyes
and
his
face
in
the
shadow
well
it
was
evening
but
mind
that
the
lamp
was
turned
on
my
face
it
would
be
did
you
happen
to
observe
picture
over
the
professor
head
don
miss
much
mr
holmes
maybe
learned
that
from
you
yes
saw
the
picture
young
woman
with
her
head
on
her
hands
peeping
at
you
sideways
that
painting
was
by
jean
baptiste
greuze
the
inspector
endeavoured
to
look
interested
jean
baptiste
greuze
holmes
continued
joining
his
finger
tips
and
leaning
well
back
in
his
chair
was
french
artist
who
flourished
between
the
years
1750
and
1800
allude
of
course
to
his
working
career
modern
criticism
has
more
than
indorsed
the
high
opinion
formed
of
him
by
his
contemporaries
the
inspector
eyes
grew
abstracted
hadn
we
better
he
said
we
are
doing
so
holmes
interrupted
all
that
am
saying
has
very
direct
and
vital
bearing
upon
what
you
have
called
the
birlstone
mystery
in
fact
it
may
in
sense
be
called
the
very
centre
of
it
macDonald
smiled
feebly
and
looked
appealingly
to
me
your
thoughts
move
bit
too
quick
for
me
mr
holmes
you
leave
out
link
or
two
and
can
get
over
the
gap
what
in
the
whole
wide
world
can
be
the
connection
between
this
dead
painting
man
and
the
affair
at
birlstone
all
knowledge
comes
useful
to
the
detective
remarked
holmes
even
the
trivial
fact
that
in
the
year
1865
picture
by
greuze
entitled
la
jeune
fille
agneau
fetched
one
million
two
hundred
thousand
francs
more
than
forty
thousand
pounds
at
the
portalis
sale
may
start
train
of
reflection
in
your
mind
it
was
clear
that
it
did
the
inspector
looked
honestly
interested
may
remind
you
holmes
continued
that
the
professor
salary
can
be
ascertained
in
several
trustworthy
books
of
reference
it
is
seven
hundred
year
then
how
could
he
buy
quite
so
how
could
he
ay
that
remarkable
said
the
inspector
thoughtfully
talk
away
mr
holmes
just
loving
it
fine
holmes
smiled
he
was
always
warmed
by
genuine
admiration
the
characteristic
of
the
real
artist
what
about
birlstone
he
asked
we
ve
time
yet
said
the
inspector
glancing
at
his
watch
ve
cab
at
the
door
and
it
won
take
us
twenty
minutes
to
victoria
but
about
this
picture
thought
you
told
me
once
mr
holmes
that
you
had
never
met
professor
moriarty
no
never
have
then
how
do
you
know
about
his
rooms
ah
that
another
matter
have
been
three
times
in
his
rooms
twice
waiting
for
him
under
different
pretexts
and
leaving
before
he
came
once
well
can
hardly
tell
about
the
once
to
an
official
detective
it
was
on
the
last
occasion
that
took
the
liberty
of
running
over
his
papers
with
the
most
unexpected
results
you
found
something
compromising
absolutely
nothing
that
was
what
amazed
me
however
you
have
now
seen
the
point
of
the
picture
it
shows
him
to
be
very
wealthy
man
how
did
he
acquire
wealth
he
is
unmarried
his
younger
brother
is
station
master
in
the
west
of
england
his
chair
is
worth
seven
hundred
year
and
he
owns
greuze
well
surely
the
inference
is
plain
you
mean
that
he
has
great
income
and
that
he
must
earn
it
in
an
illegal
fashion
exactly
of
course
have
other
reasons
for
thinking
so
dozens
of
exiguous
threads
which
lead
vaguely
up
towards
the
centre
of
the
web
where
the
poisonous
motionless
creature
is
lurking
only
mention
the
greuze
because
it
brings
the
matter
within
the
range
of
your
own
observation
well
mr
holmes
admit
that
what
you
say
is
interesting
it
more
than
interesting
it
just
wonderful
but
let
us
have
it
little
clearer
if
you
can
is
it
forgery
coining
burglary
where
does
the
money
come
from

or
thereabouts
then
he
no
use
to
me
practical
man
mr
mac
the
most
practical
thing
that
you
ever
did
in
your
life
would
be
to
shut
yourself
up
for
three
months
and
read
twelve
hours
day
at
the
annals
of
crime
everything
comes
in
circles
even
professor
moriarty
jonathan
wild
was
the
hidden
force
of
the
london
criminals
to
whom
he
sold
his
brains
and
his
organization
on
fifteen
per
cent
commission
the
old
wheel
turns
and
the
same
spoke
comes
up
it
all
been
done
before
and
will
be
again
ll
tell
you
one
or
two
things
about
moriarty
which
may
interest
you
ll
interest
me
right
enough
happen
to
know
who
is
the
first
link
in
his
chain
with
this
napoleon
gone
wrong
at
one
end
and
hundred
broken
fighting
men
pickpockets
blackmailers
and
card
sharpers
at
the
other
with
every
sort
of
crime
in
between
his
chief
of
staff
is
colonel
sebastian
moran
as
aloof
and
guarded
and
inaccessible
to
the
law
as
himself
what
do
you
think
he
pays
him
like
to
hear
six
thousand
year
that
paying
for
brains
you
see
the
american
business
principle
learned
that
detail
quite
by
chance
it
more
than
the
prime
minister
gets
that
gives
you
an
idea
of
moriarty
gains
and
of
the
scale
on
which
he
works
another
point
made
it
my
business
to
hunt
down
some
of
moriarty
checks
lately
just
common
innocent
checks
that
he
pays
his
household
bills
with
they
were
drawn
on
six
different
banks
does
that
make
any
impression
on
your
mind
queer
certainly
but
what
do
you
gather
from
it
that
he
wanted
no
gossip
about
his
wealth
no
single
man
should
know
what
he
had
have
no
doubt
that
he
has
twenty
banking
accounts
the
bulk
of
his
fortune
abroad
in
the
deutsche
bank
or
the
credit
lyonnais
as
likely
as
not
sometime
when
you
have
year
or
two
to
spare
commend
to
you
the
study
of
professor
moriarty
inspector
macDonald
had
grown
steadily
more
impressed
as
the
conversation
proceeded
he
had
lost
himself
in
his
interest
now
his
practical
scotch
intelligence
brought
him
back
with
snap
to
the
matter
in
hand
he
can
keep
anyhow
said
he
you
ve
got
us
side
tracked
with
your
interesting
anecdotes
mr
holmes
what
really
counts
is
your
remark
that
there
is
some
connection
between
the
professor
and
the
crime
that
you
get
from
the
warning
received
through
the
man
porlock
can
we
for
our
present
practical
needs
get
any
further
than
that
we
may
form
some
conception
as
to
the
motives
of
the
crime
it
is
as
gather
from
your
original
remarks
an
inexplicable
or
at
least
an
unexplained
murder
now
presuming
that
the
source
of
the
crime
is
as
we
suspect
it
to
be
there
might
be
two
different
motives
in
the
first
place
may
tell
you
that
moriarty
rules
with
rod
of
iron
over
his
people
his
discipline
is
tremendous
there
is
only
one
punishment
in
his
code
it
is
death
now
we
might
suppose
that
this
murdered
man
this
douglas
whose
approaching
fate
was
known
by
one
of
the
arch
criminal
subordinates
had
in
some
way
betrayed
the
chief
his
punishment
followed
and
would
be
known
to
all
if
only
to
put
the
fear
of
death
into
them
well
that
is
one
suggestion
mr
holmes
the
other
is
that
it
has
been
engineered
by
moriarty
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
was
there
any
robbery
have
not
heard
if
so
it
would
of
course
be
against
the
first
hypothesis
and
in
favour
of
the
second
moriarty
may
have
been
engaged
to
engineer
it
on
promise
of
part
spoils
or
he
may
have
been
paid
so
much
down
to
manage
it
either
is
possible
but
whichever
it
may
be
or
if
it
is
some
third
combination
it
is
down
at
birlstone
that
we
must
seek
the
solution
know
our
man
too
well
to
suppose
that
he
has
left
anything
up
here
which
may
lead
us
to
him
then
to
birlstone
we
must
go
cried
macDonald
jumping
from
his
chair
my
word
it
later
than
thought
can
give
you
gentlemen
five
minutes
for
preparation
and
that
is
all
and
ample
for
us
both
said
holmes
as
he
sprang
up
and
hastened
to
change
from
his
dressing
gown
to
his
coat
while
we
are
on
our
way
mr
mac
will
ask
you
to
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
all
about
it
all
about
it
proved
to
be
disappointingly
little
and
yet
there
was
enough
to
assure
us
that
the
case
before
us
might
well
be
worthy
of
the
expert
closest
attention
he
brightened
and
rubbed
his
thin
hands
together
as
he
listened
to
the
meagre
but
remarkable
details
long
series
of
sterile
weeks
lay
behind
us
and
here
at
last
there
was
fitting
object
for
those
remarkable
powers
which
like
all
special
gifts
become
irksome
to
their
owner
when
they
are
not
in
use
that
razor
brain
blunted
and
rusted
with
inaction
sherlock
holmes
eyes
glistened
his
pale
cheeks
took
warmer
hue
and
his
whole
eager
face
shone
with
an
inward
light
when
the
call
for
work
reached
him
leaning
forward
in
the
cab
he
listened
intently
to
macDonald
short
sketch
of
the
problem
which
awaited
us
in
sussex
the
inspector
was
himself
dependent
as
he
explained
to
us
upon
scribbled
account
forwarded
to
him
by
the
milk
train
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
white
mason
the
local
officer
was
personal
friend
and
hence
macDonald
had
been
notified
much
more
promptly
than
is
usual
at
scotland
yard
when
provincials
need
their
assistance
it
is
very
cold
scent
upon
which
the
metropolitan
expert
is
generally
asked
to
run
dear
inspector
macdonald
said
the
letter
which
he
read
to
us
official
requisition
for
your
services
is
in
separate
envelope
this
is
for
your
private
eye
wire
me
what
train
in
the
morning
you
can
get
for
birlstone
and
will
meet
it
or
have
it
met
if
am
too
occupied
this
case
is
snorter
don
waste
moment
in
getting
started
if
you
can
bring
mr
holmes
please
do
so
for
he
will
find
something
after
his
own
heart
we
would
think
the
whole
thing
had
been
fixed
up
for
theatrical
effect
if
there
wasn
dead
man
in
the
middle
of
it
my
word
it
is
snorter
your
friend
seems
to
be
no
fool
remarked
holmes
no
sir
white
mason
is
very
live
man
if
am
any
judge
well
have
you
anything
more
only
that
he
will
give
us
every
detail
when
we
meet
then
how
did
you
get
at
mr
douglas
and
the
fact
that
he
had
been
horribly
murdered
that
was
in
the
enclosed
official
report
it
didn
say
horrible
that
not
recognized
official
term
it
gave
the
name
john
douglas
it
mentioned
that
his
injuries
had
been
in
the
head
from
the
discharge
of
shotgun
it
also
mentioned
the
hour
of
the
alarm
which
was
close
on
to
midnight
last
night
it
added
that
the
case
was
undoubtedly
one
of
murder
but
that
no
arrest
had
been
made
and
that
the
case
was
one
which
presented
some
very
perplexing
and
extraordinary
features
that
absolutely
all
we
have
at
present
mr
holmes
then
with
your
permission
we
will
leave
it
at
that
mr
mac
the
temptation
to
form
premature
theories
upon
insufficient
data
is
the
bane
of
our
profession
can
see
only
two
things
for
certain
at
present
great
brain
in
london
and
dead
man
in
sussex
it
the
chain
between
that
we
are
going
to
trace
iii
the
tragedy
of
birlstone
now
for
moment
will
ask
leave
to
remove
my
own
insignificant
personality
and
to
describe
events
which
occurred
before
we
arrived
upon
the
scene
by
the
light
of
knowledge
which
came
to
us
afterwards
only
in
this
way
can
make
the
reader
appreciate
the
people
concerned
and
the
strange
setting
in
which
their
fate
was
cast
the
village
of
birlstone
is
small
and
very
ancient
cluster
of
half
timbered
cottages
on
the
northern
border
of
the
county
of
sussex
for
centuries
it
had
remained
unchanged
but
within
the
last
few
years
its
picturesque
appearance
and
situation
have
attracted
number
of
well
to
do
residents
whose
villas
peep
out
from
the
woods
around
these
woods
are
locally
supposed
to
be
the
extreme
fringe
of
the
great
weald
forest
which
thins
away
until
it
reaches
the
northern
chalk
downs
number
of
small
shops
have
come
into
being
to
meet
the
wants
of
the
increased
population
so
there
seems
some
prospect
that
birlstone
may
soon
grow
from
an
ancient
village
into
modern
town
it
is
the
centre
for
considerable
area
of
country
since
tunbridge
wells
the
nearest
place
of
importance
is
ten
or
twelve
miles
to
the
eastward
over
the
borders
of
kent
about
half
mile
from
the
town
standing
in
an
old
park
famous
for
its
huge
beech
trees
is
the
ancient
manor
house
of
birlstone
part
of
this
venerable
building
dates
back
to
the
time
of
the
first
crusade
when
hugo
de
capus
built
fortalice
in
the
centre
of
the
estate
which
had
been
granted
to
him
by
the
red
king
this
was
destroyed
by
fire
in
1543
and
some
of
its
smoke
blackened
corner
stones
were
used
when
in
jacobean
times
brick
country
house
rose
upon
the
ruins
of
the
feudal
castle

the
manor
house
with
its
many
gables
and
its
small
diamondpaned
windows
was
still
much
as
the
builder
had
left
it
in
the
early
seventeenth
century
of
the
double
moats
which
had
guarded
its
more
warlike
predecessor
the
outer
had
been
allowed
to
dry
up
and
served
the
humble
function
of
kitchen
garden
the
inner
one
was
still
there
and
lay
forty
feet
in
breadth
though
now
only
few
feet
in
depth
round
the
whole
house
small
stream
fed
it
and
continued
beyond
it
so
that
the
sheet
of
water
though
turbid
was
never
ditch
like
or
unhealthy
the
ground
floor
windows
were
within
foot
of
the
surface
of
the
water
the
only
approach
to
the
house
was
over
drawbridge
the
chains
and
windlass
of
which
had
long
been
rusted
and
broken
the
latest
tenants
of
the
manor
house
had
however
with
characteristic
energy
set
this
right
and
the
drawbridge
was
not
only
capable
of
being
raised
but
actually
was
raised
every
evening
and
lowered
every
morning
by
thus
renewing
the
custom
of
the
old
feudal
days
the
manor
house
was
converted
into
an
island
during
the
night
fact
which
had
very
direct
bearing
upon
the
mystery
which
was
soon
to
engage
the
attention
of
all
england
the
house
had
been
untenanted
for
some
years
and
was
threatening
to
moulder
into
picturesque
decay
when
the
douglases
took
possession
of
it
this
family
consisted
of
only
two
individuals
john
douglas
and
his
wife
douglas
was
remarkable
man
both
in
character
and
in
person
in
age
he
may
have
been
about
fifty
with
strong
jawed
rugged
face
grizzling
moustache
peculiarly
keen
grey
eyes
and
wiry
vigorous
figure
which
had
lost
nothing
of
the
strength
and
activity
of
youth
he
was
cheery
and
genial
to
all
but
somewhat
offhand
in
his
manners
giving
the
impression
that
he
had
seen
life
in
social
strata
on
some
far
lower
horizon
than
the
county
society
of
sussex
yet
though
looked
at
with
some
curiosity
and
reserve
by
his
more
cultivated
neighbours
he
soon
acquired
great
popularity
among
the
villagers
subscribing
handsomely
to
all
local
objects
and
attending
their
smoking
concerts
and
other
functions
where
having
remarkably
rich
tenor
voice
he
was
always
ready
to
oblige
with
an
excellent
song
he
appeared
to
have
plenty
of
money
which
was
said
to
have
been
gained
in
the
california
gold
fields
and
it
was
clear
from
his
own
talk
and
that
of
his
wife
that
he
had
spent
part
of
his
life
in
america
the
good
impression
which
had
been
produced
by
his
generosity
and
by
his
democratic
manners
was
increased
by
reputation
gained
for
utter
indifference
to
danger
though
wretched
rider
he
turned
out
at
every
meet
and
took
the
most
amazing
falls
in
his
determination
to
hold
his
own
with
the
best
when
the
vicarage
caught
fire
he
distinguished
himself
also
by
the
fearlessness
with
which
he
reentered
the
building
to
save
property
after
the
local
fire
brigade
had
given
it
up
as
impossible
thus
it
came
about
that
john
douglas
of
the
manor
house
had
within
five
years
won
himself
quite
reputation
in
birlstone
his
wife
too
was
popular
with
those
who
had
made
her
acquaintance
though
after
the
english
fashion
the
callers
upon
stranger
who
settled
in
the
county
without
introductions
were
few
and
far
between
this
mattered
the
less
to
her
as
she
was
retiring
by
disposition
and
very
much
absorbed
to
all
appearance
in
her
husband
and
her
domestic
duties
it
was
known
that
she
was
an
english
lady
who
had
met
mr
douglas
in
london
he
being
at
that
time
widower
she
was
beautiful
woman
tall
dark
and
slender
some
twenty
years
younger
than
her
husband
disparity
which
seemed
in
no
wise
to
mar
the
contentment
of
their
family
life
it
was
remarked
sometimes
however
by
those
who
knew
them
best
that
the
confidence
between
the
two
did
not
appear
to
be
complete
since
the
wife
was
either
very
reticent
about
her
husband
past
life
or
else
as
seemed
more
likely
was
imperfectly
informed
about
it
had
also
been
noted
and
commented
upon
by
few
observant
people
that
there
were
signs
sometimes
of
some
nerve
strain
upon
the
part
of
mrs
douglas
and
that
she
would
display
acute
uneasiness
if
her
absent
husband
should
ever
be
particularly
late
in
his
return
on
quiet
countryside
where
all
gossip
is
welcome
this
weakness
of
the
lady
of
the
manor
house
did
not
pass
without
remark
and
it
bulked
larger
upon
people
memory
when
the
events
arose
which
gave
it
very
special
significance
there
was
yet
another
individual
whose
residence
under
that
roof
was
it
is
true
only
an
intermittent
one
but
whose
presence
at
the
time
of
the
strange
happenings
which
will
now
be
narrated
brought
his
name
prominently
before
the
public
this
was
cecil
james
barker
of
hales
lodge
hampstead
cecil
barker
tall
loose
jointed
figure
was
familiar
one
in
the
main
street
of
birlstone
village
for
he
was
frequent
and
welcome
visitor
at
the
manor
house
he
was
the
more
noticed
as
being
the
only
friend
of
the
past
unknown
life
of
mr
douglas
who
was
ever
seen
in
his
new
english
surroundings
barker
was
himself
an
undoubted
englishman
but
by
his
remarks
it
was
clear
that
he
had
first
known
douglas
in
america
and
had
there
lived
on
intimate
terms
with
him
he
appeared
to
be
man
of
considerable
wealth
and
was
reputed
to
be
bachelor
in
age
he
was
rather
younger
than
douglas
forty
five
at
the
most
tall
straight
broad
chested
fellow
with
clean
shaved
prize
fighter
face
thick
strong
black
eyebrows
and
pair
of
masterful
black
eyes
which
might
even
without
the
aid
of
his
very
capable
hands
clear
way
for
him
through
hostile
crowd
he
neither
rode
nor
shot
but
spent
his
days
in
wandering
round
the
old
village
with
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
or
in
driving
with
his
host
or
in
his
absence
with
his
hostess
over
the
beautiful
countryside
an
easy
going
free
handed
gentleman
said
ames
the
butler
but
my
word
had
rather
not
be
the
man
that
crossed
him
he
was
cordial
and
intimate
with
douglas
and
he
was
no
less
friendly
with
his
wife
friendship
which
more
than
once
seemed
to
cause
some
irritation
to
the
husband
so
that
even
the
servants
were
able
to
perceive
his
annoyance
such
was
the
third
person
who
was
one
of
the
family
when
the
catastrophe
occurred
as
to
the
other
denizens
of
the
old
building
it
will
suffice
out
of
large
household
to
mention
the
prim
respectable
and
capable
ames
and
mrs
allen
buxom
and
cheerful
person
who
relieved
the
lady
of
some
of
her
household
cares
the
other
six
servants
in
the
house
bear
no
relation
to
the
events
of
the
night
of
january
6th
it
was
at
eleven
forty
five
that
the
first
alarm
reached
the
small
local
police
station
in
charge
of
sergeant
wilson
of
the
sussex
constabulary
cecil
barker
much
excited
had
rushed
up
to
the
door
and
pealed
furiously
upon
the
bell
terrible
tragedy
had
occurred
at
the
manor
house
and
john
douglas
had
been
murdered
that
was
the
breathless
burden
of
his
message
he
had
hurried
back
to
the
house
followed
within
few
minutes
by
the
police
sergeant
who
arrived
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
little
after
twelve
clock
after
taking
prompt
steps
to
warn
the
county
authorities
that
something
serious
was
afoot
on
reaching
the
manor
house
the
sergeant
had
found
the
drawbridge
down
the
windows
lighted
up
and
the
whole
household
in
state
of
wild
confusion
and
alarm
the
white
faced
servants
were
huddling
together
in
the
hall
with
the
frightened
butler
wringing
his
hands
in
the
doorway
only
cecil
barker
seemed
to
be
master
of
himself
and
his
emotions
he
had
opened
the
door
which
was
nearest
to
the
entrance
and
he
had
beckoned
to
the
sergeant
to
follow
him
at
that
moment
there
arrived
dr
wood
brisk
and
capable
general
practitioner
from
the
village
the
three
men
entered
the
fatal
room
together
while
the
horrorstricken
butler
followed
at
their
heels
closing
the
door
behind
him
to
shut
out
the
terrible
scene
from
the
maid
servants
the
dead
man
lay
on
his
back
sprawling
with
outstretched
limbs
in
the
centre
of
the
room
he
was
clad
only
in
pink
dressing
gown
which
covered
his
night
clothes
there
were
carpet
slippers
on
his
bare
feet
the
doctor
knelt
beside
him
and
held
down
the
hand
lamp
which
had
stood
on
the
table
one
glance
at
the
victim
was
enough
to
show
the
healer
that
his
presence
could
be
dispensed
with
the
man
had
been
horribly
injured
lying
across
his
chest
was
curious
weapon
shotgun
with
the
barrel
sawed
off
foot
in
front
of
the
triggers
it
was
clear
that
this
had
been
fired
at
close
range
and
that
he
had
received
the
whole
charge
in
the
face
blowing
his
head
almost
to
pieces
the
triggers
had
been
wired
together
so
as
to
make
the
simultaneous
discharge
more
destructive
the
country
policeman
was
unnerved
and
troubled
by
the
tremendous
responsibility
which
had
come
so
suddenly
upon
him
we
will
touch
nothing
until
my
superiors
arrive
he
said
in
hushed
voice
staring
in
horror
at
the
dreadful
head
nothing
has
been
touched
up
to
now
said
cecil
barker
ll
answer
for
that
you
see
it
all
exactly
as
found
it

when
was
that
the
sergeant
had
drawn
out
his
notebook
it
was
just
half
past
eleven
had
not
begun
to
undress
and
was
sitting
by
the
fire
in
my
bedroom
when
heard
the
report
it
was
not
very
loud
it
seemed
to
be
muffled
rushed
down
don
suppose
it
was
thirty
seconds
before
was
in
the
room
was
the
door
open
yes
it
was
open
poor
douglas
was
lying
as
you
see
him
his
bedroom
candle
was
burning
on
the
table
it
was
who
lit
the
lamp
some
minutes
afterward
did
you
see
no
one
no
heard
mrs
douglas
coming
down
the
stair
behind
me
and
rushed
out
to
prevent
her
from
seeing
this
dreadful
sight
mrs
allen
the
housekeeper
came
and
took
her
away
ames
had
arrived
and
we
ran
back
into
the
room
once
more
but
surely
have
heard
that
the
drawbridge
is
kept
up
all
night
yes
it
was
up
until
lowered
it
then
how
could
any
murderer
have
got
away
it
is
out
of
the
question
mr
douglas
must
have
shot
himself
that
was
our
first
idea
but
see
barker
drew
aside
the
curtain
and
showed
that
the
long
diamond
paned
window
was
open
to
its
full
extent
and
look
at
this
he
held
the
lamp
down
and
illuminated
smudge
of
blood
like
the
mark
of
boot
sole
upon
the
wooden
sill
someone
has
stood
there
in
getting
out
you
mean
that
someone
waded
across
the
moat
exactly
then
if
you
were
in
the
room
within
half
minute
of
the
crime
he
must
have
been
in
the
water
at
that
very
moment
have
not
doubt
of
it
wish
to
heaven
that
had
rushed
to
the
window
but
the
curtain
screened
it
as
you
can
see
and
so
it
never
occurred
to
me
then
heard
the
step
of
mrs
douglas
and
could
not
let
her
enter
the
room
it
would
have
been
too
horrible
enough
said
the
doctor
looking
at
the
shattered
head
and
the
terrible
marks
which
surrounded
it
ve
never
seen
such
injuries
since
the
birlstone
railway
smash
but
say
remarked
the
police
sergeant
whose
slow
bucolic
common
sense
was
still
pondering
the
open
window
it
all
very
well
your
saying
that
man
escaped
by
wading
this
moat
but
what
ask
you
is
how
did
he
ever
get
into
the
house
at
all
if
the
bridge
was
up
ah
that
the
question
said
barker
at
what
clock
was
it
raised
it
was
nearly
six
clock
said
ames
the
butler
ve
heard
said
the
sergeant
that
it
was
usually
raised
at
sunset
that
would
be
nearer
half
past
four
than
six
at
this
time
of
year
mrs
douglas
had
visitors
to
tea
said
ames
couldn
raise
it
until
they
went
then
wound
it
up
myself
then
it
comes
to
this
said
the
sergeant
if
anyone
came
from
outside
if
they
did
they
must
have
got
in
across
the
bridge
before
six
and
been
in
hiding
ever
since
until
mr
douglas
came
into
the
room
after
eleven
that
is
so
mr
douglas
went
round
the
house
every
night
the
last
thing
before
he
turned
in
to
see
that
the
lights
were
right
that
brought
him
in
here
the
man
was
waiting
and
shot
him
then
he
got
away
through
the
window
and
left
his
gun
behind
him
that
how
read
it
for
nothing
else
will
fit
the
facts
the
sergeant
picked
up
card
which
lay
beside
the
dead
man
on
the
floor
the
initials
and
under
them
the
number
341
were
rudely
scrawled
in
ink
upon
it
what
this
he
asked
holding
it
up
barker
looked
at
it
with
curiosity
never
noticed
it
before
he
said
the
murderer
must
have
left
it
behind
him
341
can
make
no
sense
of
that
the
sergeant
kept
turning
it
over
in
his
big
fingers
what
somebody
initials
maybe
what
have
you
got
there
dr
wood
it
was
good
sized
hammer
which
had
been
lying
on
the
rug
in
front
of
the
fireplace
substantial
workmanlike
hammer
cecil
barker
pointed
to
box
of
brass
headed
nails
upon
the
mantelpiece
mr
douglas
was
altering
the
pictures
yesterday
he
said
saw
him
myself
standing
upon
that
chair
and
fixing
the
big
picture
above
it
that
accounts
for
the
hammer
we
best
put
it
back
on
the
rug
where
we
found
it
said
the
sergeant
scratching
his
puzzled
head
in
his
perplexity
it
will
want
the
best
brains
in
the
force
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
thing
it
will
be
london
job
before
it
is
finished
he
raised
the
hand
lamp
and
walked
slowly
round
the
room
hullo
he
cried
excitedly
drawing
the
window
curtain
to
one
side
what
clock
were
those
curtains
drawn
when
the
lamps
were
lit
said
the
butler
it
would
be
shortly
after
four
someone
had
been
hiding
here
sure
enough
he
held
down
the
light
and
the
marks
of
muddy
boots
were
very
visible
in
the
corner
bound
to
say
this
bears
out
your
theory
mr
barker
it
looks
as
if
the
man
got
into
the
house
after
four
when
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
before
six
when
the
bridge
was
raised
he
slipped
into
this
room
because
it
was
the
first
that
he
saw
there
was
no
other
place
where
he
could
hide
so
he
popped
in
behind
this
curtain
that
all
seems
clear
enough
it
is
likely
that
his
main
idea
was
to
burgle
the
house
but
mr
douglas
chanced
to
come
upon
him
so
he
murdered
him
and
escaped
that
how
read
it
said
barker
but
say
aren
we
wasting
precious
time
couldn
we
start
out
and
scour
the
country
before
the
fellow
gets
away
the
sergeant
considered
for
moment
there
are
no
trains
before
six
in
the
morning
so
he
can
get
away
by
rail
if
he
goes
by
road
with
his
legs
all
dripping
it
odds
that
someone
will
notice
him
anyhow
can
leave
here
myself
until
am
relieved
but
think
none
of
you
should
go
until
we
see
more
clearly
how
we
all
stand
the
doctor
had
taken
the
lamp
and
was
narrowly
scrutinizing
the
body
what
this
mark
he
asked
could
this
have
any
connection
with
the
crime
the
dead
man
right
arm
was
thrust
out
from
his
dressing
gown
and
exposed
as
high
as
the
elbow
about
halfway
up
the
forearm
was
curious
brown
design
triangle
inside
circle
standing
out
in
vivid
relief
upon
the
lard
coloured
skin
it
not
tattooed
said
the
doctor
peering
through
his
glasses
never
saw
anything
like
it
the
man
has
been
branded
at
some
time
as
they
brand
cattle
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
don
profess
to
know
the
meaning
of
it
said
cecil
barker
but
have
seen
the
mark
on
douglas
many
times
this
last
ten
years
and
so
have
said
the
butler
many
time
when
the
master
has
rolled
up
his
sleeves
have
noticed
that
very
mark
ve
often
wondered
what
it
could
be
then
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
crime
anyhow
said
the
sergeant
but
it
rum
thing
all
the
same
everything
about
this
case
is
rum
well
what
is
it
now
the
butler
had
given
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
and
was
pointing
at
the
dead
man
outstretched
hand
they
ve
taken
his
wedding
ring
he
gasped
what
yes
indeed
master
always
wore
his
plain
gold
wedding
ring
on
the
little
finger
of
his
left
hand
that
ring
with
the
rough
nugget
on
it
was
above
it
and
the
twisted
snake
ring
on
the
third
finger
there
the
nugget
and
there
the
snake
but
the
wedding
ring
is
gone
he
right
said
barker
do
you
tell
me
said
the
sergeant
that
the
wedding
ring
was
below
the
other
always
then
the
murderer
or
whoever
it
was
first
took
off
this
ring
you
call
the
nugget
ring
then
the
wedding
ring
and
afterwards
put
the
nugget
ring
back
again
that
is
so
the
worthy
country
policeman
shook
his
head
seems
to
me
the
sooner
we
get
london
on
to
this
case
the
better
said
he
white
mason
is
smart
man
no
local
job
has
ever
been
too
much
for
white
mason
it
won
be
long
now
before
he
is
here
to
help
us
but
expect
we
ll
have
to
look
to
london
before
we
are
through
anyhow
not
ashamed
to
say
that
it
is
deal
too
thick
for
the
likes
of
me
iv
darkness
at
three
in
the
morning
the
chief
sussex
detective
obeying
the
urgent
call
from
sergeant
wilson
of
birlstone
arrived
from
headquarters
in
light
dog
cart
behind
breathless
trotter
by
the
five
forty
train
in
the
morning
he
had
sent
his
message
to
scotland
yard
and
he
was
at
the
birlstone
station
at
twelve
clock
to
welcome
us
white
mason
was
quiet
comfortablelooking
person
in
loose
tweed
suit
with
clean
shaved
ruddy
face
stoutish
body
and
powerful
bandy
legs
adorned
with
gaiters
looking
like
small
farmer
retired
gamekeeper
or
anything
upon
earth
except
very
favourable
specimen
of
the
provincial
criminal
officer
real
downright
snorter
mr
macDonald
he
kept
repeating
we
ll
have
the
pressmen
down
like
flies
when
they
understand
it
hoping
we
will
get
our
work
done
before
they
get
poking
their
noses
into
it
and
messing
up
all
the
trails
there
has
been
nothing
like
this
that
can
remember
there
are
some
bits
that
will
come
home
to
you
mr
holmes
or
am
mistaken
and
you
also
dr
watson
for
the
medicos
will
have
word
to
say
before
we
finish
your
room
is
at
the
westville
arms
there
no
other
place
but
hear
that
it
is
clean
and
good
the
man
will
carry
your
bags
this
way
gentlemen
if
you
please

he
was
very
bustling
and
genial
person
this
sussex
detective
in
ten
minutes
we
had
all
found
our
quarters
in
ten
more
we
were
seated
in
the
parlour
of
the
inn
and
being
treated
to
rapid
sketch
of
those
events
which
have
been
outlined
in
the
previous
chapter
macDonald
made
an
occasional
note
while
holmes
sat
absorbed
with
the
expression
of
surprised
and
reverent
admiration
with
which
the
botanist
surveys
the
rare
and
precious
bloom
remarkable
he
said
when
the
story
was
unfolded
most
remarkable
can
hardly
recall
any
case
where
the
features
have
been
more
peculiar
thought
you
would
say
so
mr
holmes
said
white
mason
in
great
delight
we
re
well
up
with
the
times
in
sussex
ve
told
you
now
how
matters
were
up
to
the
time
when
took
over
from
sergeant
wilson
between
three
and
four
this
morning
my
word
made
the
old
mare
go
but
need
not
have
been
in
such
hurry
as
it
turned
out
for
there
was
nothing
immediate
that
could
do
sergeant
wilson
had
all
the
facts
checked
them
and
considered
them
and
maybe
added
few
of
my
own
what
were
they
asked
holmes
eagerly
well
first
had
the
hammer
examined
there
was
dr
wood
there
to
help
me
we
found
no
signs
of
violence
upon
it
was
hoping
that
if
mr
douglas
defended
himself
with
the
hammer
he
might
have
left
his
mark
upon
the
murderer
before
he
dropped
it
on
the
mat
but
there
was
no
stain
that
of
course
proves
nothing
at
all
remarked
inspector
macDonald
there
has
been
many
hammer
murder
and
no
trace
on
the
hammer
quite
so
it
doesn
prove
it
wasn
used
but
there
might
have
been
stains
and
that
would
have
helped
us
as
matter
of
fact
there
were
none
then
examined
the
gun
they
were
buckshot
cartridges
and
as
sergeant
wilson
pointed
out
the
triggers
were
wired
together
so
that
if
you
pulled
on
the
hinder
one
both
barrels
were
discharged
whoever
fixed
that
up
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
was
going
to
take
no
chances
of
missing
his
man
the
sawed
gun
was
not
more
than
two
foot
long
one
could
carry
it
easily
under
one
coat
there
was
no
complete
maker
name
but
the
printed
letters
were
on
the
fluting
between
the
barrels
and
the
rest
of
the
name
had
been
cut
off
by
the
saw
big
with
flourish
above
it
and
smaller
asked
holmes
exactly
pennsylvania
small
arms
company
well
known
american
firm
said
holmes
white
mason
gazed
at
my
friend
as
the
little
village
practitioner
looks
at
the
harley
street
specialist
who
by
word
can
solve
the
difficulties
that
perplex
him
that
is
very
helpful
mr
holmes
no
doubt
you
are
right
wonderful
do
you
carry
the
names
of
all
the
gun
makers
in
the
world
in
your
memory
holmes
dismissed
the
subject
with
wave
no
doubt
it
is
an
american
shotgun
white
mason
continued
seem
to
have
read
that
sawed
off
shotgun
is
weapon
used
in
some
parts
of
america
apart
from
the
name
upon
the
barrel
the
idea
had
occurred
to
me
there
is
some
evidence
then
that
this
man
who
entered
the
house
and
killed
its
master
was
an
american
macDonald
shook
his
head
man
you
are
surely
travelling
overfast
said
he
have
heard
no
evidence
yet
that
any
stranger
was
ever
in
the
house
at
all
the
open
window
the
blood
on
the
sill
the
queer
card
the
marks
of
boots
in
the
corner
the
gun
nothing
there
that
could
not
have
been
arranged
mr
douglas
was
an
american
or
had
lived
long
in
america
so
had
mr
barker
you
don
need
to
import
an
american
from
outside
in
order
to
account
for
american
doings
ames
the
butler
what
about
him
is
he
reliable
ten
years
with
sir
charles
chandos
as
solid
as
rock
he
has
been
with
douglas
ever
since
he
took
the
manor
house
five
years
ago
he
has
never
seen
gun
of
this
sort
in
the
house
the
gun
was
made
to
conceal
that
why
the
barrels
were
sawed
it
would
fit
into
any
box
how
could
he
swear
there
was
no
such
gun
in
the
house
well
anyhow
he
had
never
seen
one
macDonald
shook
his
obstinate
scotch
head
not
convinced
yet
that
there
was
ever
anyone
in
the
house
said
he
asking
you
to
conseedar
his
accent
became
more
aberdonian
as
he
lost
himself
in
his
argument
asking
you
to
conseedar
what
it
involves
if
you
suppose
that
this
gun
was
ever
brought
into
the
house
and
that
all
these
strange
things
were
done
by
person
from
outside
oh
man
it
just
inconceivable
it
clean
against
common
sense
put
it
to
you
mr
holmes
judging
it
by
what
we
have
heard
well
state
your
case
mr
mac
said
holmes
in
his
most
judicial
style
the
man
is
not
burglar
supposing
that
he
ever
existed
the
ring
business
and
the
card
point
to
premeditated
murder
for
some
private
reason
very
good
here
is
man
who
slips
into
house
with
the
deliberate
intention
of
committing
murder
he
knows
if
he
knows
anything
that
he
will
have
deeficulty
in
making
his
escape
as
the
house
is
surrounded
with
water
what
weapon
would
he
choose
you
would
say
the
most
silent
in
the
world
then
he
could
hope
when
the
deed
was
done
to
slip
quickly
from
the
window
to
wade
the
moat
and
to
get
away
at
his
leisure
that
understandable
but
is
it
understandable
that
he
should
go
out
of
his
way
to
bring
with
him
the
most
noisy
weapon
he
could
select
knowing
well
that
it
will
fetch
every
human
being
in
the
house
to
the
spot
as
quick
as
they
can
run
and
that
it
is
all
odds
that
he
will
be
seen
before
he
can
get
across
the
moat
is
that
credible
mr
holmes
well
you
put
the
case
strongly
my
friend
replied
thoughtfully
it
certainly
needs
good
deal
of
justification
may
ask
mr
white
mason
whether
you
examined
the
farther
side
of
the
moat
at
once
to
see
if
there
were
any
signs
of
the
man
having
climbed
out
from
the
water
there
were
no
signs
mr
holmes
but
it
is
stone
ledge
and
one
could
hardly
expect
them
no
tracks
or
marks
none
ha
would
there
be
any
objection
mr
white
mason
to
our
going
down
to
the
house
at
once
there
may
possibly
be
some
small
point
which
might
be
suggestive
was
going
to
propose
it
mr
holmes
but
thought
it
well
to
put
you
in
touch
with
all
the
facts
before
we
go
suppose
if
anything
should
strike
you
white
mason
looked
doubtfully
at
the
amateur
have
worked
with
mr
holmes
before
said
inspector
macDonald
he
plays
the
game
my
own
idea
of
the
game
at
any
rate
said
holmes
with
smile
go
into
case
to
help
the
ends
of
justice
and
the
work
of
the
police
if
have
ever
separated
myself
from
the
official
force
it
is
because
they
have
first
separated
themselves
from
me
have
no
wish
ever
to
score
at
their
expense
at
the
same
time
mr
white
mason
claim
the
right
to
work
in
my
own
way
and
give
my
results
at
my
own
time
complete
rather
than
in
stages
am
sure
we
are
honoured
by
your
presence
and
to
show
you
all
we
know
said
white
mason
cordially
come
along
dr
watson
and
when
the
time
comes
we
ll
all
hope
for
place
in
your
book
we
walked
down
the
quaint
village
street
with
row
of
pollarded
elms
on
each
side
of
it
just
beyond
were
two
ancient
stone
pillars
weather
stained
and
lichen
blotched
bearing
upon
their
summits
shapeless
something
which
had
once
been
the
rampant
lion
of
capus
of
birlstone
short
walk
along
the
winding
drive
with
such
sward
and
oaks
around
it
as
one
only
sees
in
rural
england
then
sudden
turn
and
the
long
low
jacobean
house
of
dingy
liver
coloured
brick
lay
before
us
with
an
old
fashioned
garden
of
cut
yews
on
each
side
of
it
as
we
approached
it
there
was
the
wooden
drawbridge
and
the
beautiful
broad
moat
as
still
and
luminous
as
quicksilver
in
the
cold
winter
sunshine
three
centuries
had
flowed
past
the
old
manor
house
centuries
of
births
and
of
homecomings
of
country
dances
and
of
the
meetings
of
fox
hunters
strange
that
now
in
its
old
age
this
dark
business
should
have
cast
its
shadow
upon
the
venerable
walls
and
yet
those
strange
peaked
roofs
and
quaint
overhung
gables
were
fitting
covering
to
grim
and
terrible
intrigue
as
looked
at
the
deep
set
windows
and
the
long
sweep
of
the
dull
coloured
water
lapped
front
felt
that
no
more
fitting
scene
could
be
set
for
such
tragedy
that
the
window
said
white
mason
that
one
on
the
immediate
right
of
the
drawbridge
it
open
just
as
it
was
found
last
night
it
looks
rather
narrow
for
man
to
pass
well
it
wasn
fat
man
anyhow
we
don
need
your
deductions
mr
holmes
to
tell
us
that
but
you
or
could
squeeze
through
all
right
holmes
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
moat
and
looked
across
then
he
examined
the
stone
ledge
and
the
grass
border
beyond
it
ve
had
good
look
mr
holmes
said
white
mason
there
is
nothing
there
no
sign
that
anyone
has
landed
but
why
should
he
leave
any
sign
exactly
why
should
he

generally
about
this
colour
the
stream
brings
down
the
clay
how
deep
is
it
about
two
feet
at
each
side
and
three
in
the
middle
so
we
can
put
aside
all
idea
of
the
man
having
been
drowned
in
crossing
no
child
could
not
be
drowned
in
it
we
walked
across
the
drawbridge
and
were
admitted
by
quaint
gnarled
dried
up
person
who
was
the
butler
ames
the
poor
old
fellow
was
white
and
quivering
from
the
shock
the
village
sergeant
tall
formal
melancholy
man
still
held
his
vigil
in
the
room
of
fate
the
doctor
had
departed
anything
fresh
sergeant
wilson
asked
white
mason
no
sir
then
you
can
go
home
you
ve
had
enough
we
can
send
for
you
if
we
want
you
the
butler
had
better
wait
outside
tell
him
to
warn
mr
cecil
barker
mrs
douglas
and
the
housekeeper
that
we
may
want
word
with
them
presently
now
gentlemen
perhaps
you
will
allow
me
to
give
you
the
views
have
formed
first
and
then
you
will
be
able
to
arrive
at
your
own
he
impressed
me
this
country
specialist
he
had
solid
grip
of
fact
and
cool
clear
common
sense
brain
which
should
take
him
some
way
in
his
profession
holmes
listened
to
him
intently
with
no
sign
of
that
impatience
which
the
official
exponent
too
often
produced
is
it
suicide
or
is
it
murder
that
our
first
question
gentlemen
is
it
not
if
it
were
suicide
then
we
have
to
believe
that
this
man
began
by
taking
off
his
wedding
ring
and
concealing
it
that
he
then
came
down
here
in
his
dressing
gown
trampled
mud
into
corner
behind
the
curtain
in
order
to
give
the
idea
someone
had
waited
for
him
opened
the
window
put
blood
on
the
we
can
surely
dismiss
that
said
macDonald
so
think
suicide
is
out
of
the
question
then
murder
has
been
done
what
we
have
to
determine
is
whether
it
was
done
by
someone
outside
or
inside
the
house
well
let
hear
the
argument
there
are
considerable
difficulties
both
ways
and
yet
one
or
the
other
it
must
be
we
will
suppose
first
that
some
person
or
persons
inside
the
house
did
the
crime
they
got
this
man
down
here
at
time
when
everything
was
still
and
yet
no
one
was
asleep
they
then
did
the
deed
with
the
queerest
and
noisiest
weapon
in
the
world
so
as
to
tell
everyone
what
had
happened
weapon
that
was
never
seen
in
the
house
before
that
does
not
seem
very
likely
start
does
it
no
it
does
not
well
then
everyone
is
agreed
that
after
the
alarm
was
given
only
minute
at
the
most
had
passed
before
the
whole
household
not
mr
cecil
barker
alone
though
he
claims
to
have
been
the
first
but
ames
and
all
of
them
were
on
the
spot
do
you
tell
me
that
in
that
time
the
guilty
person
managed
to
make
footmarks
in
the
corner
open
the
window
mark
the
sill
with
blood
take
the
wedding
ring
off
the
dead
man
finger
and
all
the
rest
of
it
impossible
you
put
it
very
clearly
said
holmes
am
inclined
to
agree
with
you
well
then
we
are
driven
back
to
the
theory
that
it
was
done
by
someone
from
outside
we
are
still
faced
with
some
big
difficulties
but
anyhow
they
have
ceased
to
be
impossibilities
the
man
got
into
the
house
between
four
thirty
and
six
that
is
to
say
between
dusk
and
the
time
when
the
bridge
was
raised
there
had
been
some
visitors
and
the
door
was
open
so
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
him
he
may
have
been
common
burglar
or
he
may
have
had
some
private
grudge
against
mr
douglas
since
mr
douglas
has
spent
most
of
his
life
in
america
and
this
shotgun
seems
to
be
an
american
weapon
it
would
seem
that
the
private
grudge
is
the
more
likely
theory
he
slipped
into
this
room
because
it
was
the
first
he
came
to
and
he
hid
behind
the
curtain
there
he
remained
until
past
eleven
at
night
at
that
time
mr
douglas
entered
the
room
it
was
short
interview
if
there
were
any
interview
at
all
for
mrs
douglas
declares
that
her
husband
had
not
left
her
more
than
few
minutes
when
she
heard
the
shot
the
candle
shows
that
said
holmes
exactly
the
candle
which
was
new
one
is
not
burned
more
than
half
an
inch
he
must
have
placed
it
on
the
table
before
he
was
attacked
otherwise
of
course
it
would
have
fallen
when
he
fell
this
shows
that
he
was
not
attacked
the
instant
that
he
entered
the
room
when
mr
barker
arrived
the
candle
was
lit
and
the
lamp
was
out
that
all
clear
enough
well
now
we
can
reconstruct
things
on
those
lines
mr
douglas
enters
the
room
he
puts
down
the
candle
man
appears
from
behind
the
curtain
he
is
armed
with
this
gun
he
demands
the
wedding
ring
heaven
only
knows
why
but
so
it
must
have
been
mr
douglas
gave
it
up
then
either
in
cold
blood
or
in
the
course
of
struggle
douglas
may
have
gripped
the
hammer
that
was
found
upon
the
mat
he
shot
douglas
in
this
horrible
way
he
dropped
his
gun
and
also
it
would
seem
this
queer
card
341
whatever
that
may
mean
and
he
made
his
escape
through
the
window
and
across
the
moat
at
the
very
moment
when
cecil
barker
was
discovering
the
crime
how
that
mr
holmes
very
interesting
but
just
little
unconvincing
man
it
would
be
absolute
nonsense
if
it
wasn
that
anything
else
is
even
worse
cried
macDonald
somebody
killed
the
man
and
whoever
it
was
could
clearly
prove
to
you
that
he
should
have
done
it
some
other
way
what
does
he
mean
by
allowing
his
retreat
to
be
cut
off
like
that
what
does
he
mean
by
using
shotgun
when
silence
was
his
one
chance
of
escape
come
mr
holmes
it
up
to
you
to
give
us
lead
since
you
say
mr
white
mason
theory
is
unconvincing
holmes
had
sat
intently
observant
during
this
long
discussion
missing
no
word
that
was
said
with
his
keen
eyes
darting
to
right
and
to
left
and
his
forehead
wrinkled
with
speculation
should
like
few
more
facts
before
get
so
far
as
theory
mr
mac
said
he
kneeling
down
beside
the
body
dear
me
these
injuries
are
really
appalling
can
we
have
the
butler
in
for
moment
ames
understand
that
you
have
often
seen
this
very
unusual
mark
branded
triangle
inside
circle
upon
mr
douglas
forearm
frequently
sir
you
never
heard
any
speculation
as
to
what
it
meant
no
sir
it
must
have
caused
great
pain
when
it
was
inflicted
it
is
undoubtedly
burn
now
observe
ames
that
there
is
small
piece
of
plaster
at
the
angle
of
mr
douglas
jaw
did
you
observe
that
in
life
yes
sir
he
cut
himself
in
shaving
yesterday
morning
did
you
ever
know
him
to
cut
himself
in
shaving
before
not
for
very
long
time
sir
suggestive
said
holmes
it
may
of
course
be
mere
coincidence
or
it
may
point
to
some
nervousness
which
would
indicate
that
he
had
reason
to
apprehend
danger
had
you
noticed
anything
unusual
in
his
conduct
yesterday
ames
it
struck
me
that
he
was
little
restless
and
excited
sir
ha
the
attack
may
not
have
been
entirely
unexpected
we
do
seem
to
make
little
progress
do
we
not
perhaps
you
would
rather
do
the
questioning
mr
mac
no
mr
holmes
it
in
better
hands
than
mine
well
then
we
will
pass
to
this
card
341
it
is
rough
cardboard
have
you
any
of
the
sort
in
the
house
don
think
so
holmes
walked
across
to
the
desk
and
dabbed
little
ink
from
each
bottle
on
to
the
blotting
paper
it
was
not
printed
in
this
room
he
said
this
is
black
ink
and
the
other
purplish
it
was
done
by
thick
pen
and
these
are
fine
no
it
was
done
elsewhere
should
say
can
you
make
anything
of
the
inscription
ames
no
sir
nothing
what
do
you
think
mr
mac
it
gives
me
the
impression
of
secret
society
of
some
sort
the
same
with
his
badge
upon
the
forearm
that
my
idea
too
said
white
mason
well
we
can
adopt
it
as
working
hypothesis
and
then
see
how
far
our
difficulties
disappear
an
agent
from
such
society
makes
his
way
into
the
house
waits
for
mr
douglas
blows
his
head
nearly
off
with
this
weapon
and
escapes
by
wading
the
moat
after
leaving
card
beside
the
dead
man
which
will
when
mentioned
in
the
papers
tell
other
members
of
the
society
that
vengeance
has
been
done
that
all
hangs
together
but
why
this
gun
of
all
weapons
exactly
and
why
the
missing
ring
quite
so
and
why
no
arrest
it
past
two
now
take
it
for
granted
that
since
dawn
every
constable
within
forty
miles
has
been
looking
out
for
wet
stranger
that
is
so
mr
holmes
well
unless
he
has
burrow
close
by
or
change
of
clothes
ready
they
can
hardly
miss
him
and
yet
they
have
missed
him
up
to
now
holmes
had
gone
to
the
window
and
was
examining
with
his
lens
the
blood
mark
on
the
sill
it
is
clearly
the
tread
of
shoe
it
is
remarkably
broad
splay
foot
one
would
say
curious
because
so
far
as
one
can
trace
any
footmark
in
this
mud
stained
corner
one
would
say
it
was
more
shapely
sole
however
they
are
certainly
very
indistinct

dumb
bells
said

dumb

there
only
one
where
the
other
don
know
mr
holmes
there
may
have
been
only
one
have
not
noticed
them
for
months
one
dumb
bell
holmes
said
seriously
but
his
remarks
were
interrupted
by
sharp
knock
at
the
door
tall
sunburned
capable
looking
clean
shaved
man
looked
in
at
us
had
no
difficulty
in
guessing
that
it
was
the
cecil
barker
of
whom
had
heard
his
masterful
eyes
travelled
quickly
with
questioning
glance
from
face
to
face
sorry
to
interrupt
your
consultation
said
he
but
you
should
hear
the
latest
news
an
arrest
no
such
luck
but
they
ve
found
his
bicycle
the
fellow
left
his
bicycle
behind
him
come
and
have
look
it
is
within
hundred
yards
of
the
hall
door
we
found
three
or
four
grooms
and
idlers
standing
in
the
drive
inspecting
bicycle
which
had
been
drawn
out
from
clump
of
evergreens
in
which
it
had
been
concealed
it
was
well
used
rudge
whitworth
splashed
as
from
considerable
journey
there
was
saddlebag
with
spanner
and
oilcan
but
no
clue
as
to
the
owner
it
would
be
grand
help
to
the
police
said
the
inspector
if
these
things
were
numbered
and
registered
but
we
must
be
thankful
for
what
we
ve
got
if
we
can
find
where
he
went
to
at
least
we
are
likely
to
get
where
he
came
from
but
what
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
wonderful
made
the
fellow
leave
it
behind
and
how
in
the
world
has
he
got
away
without
it
we
don
seem
to
get
gleam
of
light
in
the
case
mr
holmes
don
we
my
friend
answered
thoughtfully
wonder
the
people
of
the
drama
have
you
seen
all
you
want
of
the
study
asked
white
mason
as
we
reentered
the
house
for
the
time
said
the
inspector
and
holmes
nodded
then
perhaps
you
would
now
like
to
hear
the
evidence
of
some
of
the
people
in
the
house
we
could
use
the
dining
room
ames
please
come
yourself
first
and
tell
us
what
you
know
the
butler
account
was
simple
and
clear
one
and
he
gave
convincing
impression
of
sincerity
he
had
been
engaged
five
years
before
when
douglas
first
came
to
birlstone
he
understood
that
mr
douglas
was
rich
gentleman
who
had
made
his
money
in
america
he
had
been
kind
and
considerate
employer
not
quite
what
ames
was
used
to
perhaps
but
one
can
have
everything
he
never
saw
any
signs
of
apprehension
in
mr
douglas
on
the
contrary
he
was
the
most
fearless
man
he
had
ever
known
he
ordered
the
drawbridge
to
be
pulled
up
every
night
because
it
was
the
ancient
custom
of
the
old
house
and
he
liked
to
keep
the
old
ways
up
mr
douglas
seldom
went
to
london
or
left
the
village
but
on
the
day
before
the
crime
he
had
been
shopping
at
tunbridge
wells
he
ames
had
observed
some
restlessness
and
excitement
on
the
part
of
mr
douglas
that
day
for
he
had
seemed
impatient
and
irritable
which
was
unusual
with
him
he
had
not
gone
to
bed
that
night
but
was
in
the
pantry
at
the
back
of
the
house
putting
away
the
silver
when
he
heard
the
bell
ring
violently
he
heard
no
shot
but
it
was
hardly
possible
he
would
as
the
pantry
and
kitchens
were
at
the
very
back
of
the
house
and
there
were
several
closed
doors
and
long
passage
between
the
housekeeper
had
come
out
of
her
room
attracted
by
the
violent
ringing
of
the
bell
they
had
gone
to
the
front
of
the
house
together
as
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stair
he
had
seen
mrs
douglas
coming
down
it
no
she
was
not
hurrying
it
did
not
seem
to
him
that
she
was
particularly
agitated
just
as
she
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stair
mr
barker
had
rushed
out
of
the
study
he
had
stopped
mrs
douglas
and
begged
her
to
go
back
for
god
sake
go
back
to
your
room
he
cried
poor
jack
is
dead
you
can
do
nothing
for
god
sake
go
back
after
some
persuasion
upon
the
stairs
mrs
douglas
had
gone
back
she
did
not
scream
she
made
no
outcry
whatever
mrs
allen
the
housekeeper
had
taken
her
upstairs
and
stayed
with
her
in
the
bedroom
ames
and
mr
barker
had
then
returned
to
the
study
where
they
had
found
everything
exactly
as
the
police
had
seen
it
the
candle
was
not
lit
at
that
time
but
the
lamp
was
burning
they
had
looked
out
of
the
window
but
the
night
was
very
dark
and
nothing
could
be
seen
or
heard
they
had
then
rushed
out
into
the
hall
where
ames
had
turned
the
windlass
which
lowered
the
drawbridge
mr
barker
had
then
hurried
off
to
get
the
police
such
in
its
essentials
was
the
evidence
of
the
butler
the
account
of
mrs
allen
the
housekeeper
was
so
far
as
it
went
corroboration
of
that
of
her
fellow
servant
the
housekeeper
room
was
rather
nearer
to
the
front
of
the
house
than
the
pantry
in
which
ames
had
been
working
she
was
preparing
to
go
to
bed
when
the
loud
ringing
of
the
bell
had
attracted
her
attention
she
was
little
hard
of
hearing
perhaps
that
was
why
she
had
not
heard
the
shot
but
in
any
case
the
study
was
long
way
off
she
remembered
hearing
some
sound
which
she
imagined
to
be
the
slamming
of
door
that
was
good
deal
earlier
half
an
hour
at
least
before
the
ringing
of
the
bell
when
mr
ames
ran
to
the
front
she
went
with
him
she
saw
mr
barker
very
pale
and
excited
come
out
of
the
study
he
intercepted
mrs
douglas
who
was
coming
down
the
stairs
he
entreated
her
to
go
back
and
she
answered
him
but
what
she
said
could
not
be
heard
take
her
up
stay
with
her
he
had
said
to
mrs
allen
she
had
therefore
taken
her
to
the
bedroom
and
endeavoured
to
soothe
her
she
was
greatly
excited
trembling
all
over
but
made
no
other
attempt
to
go
downstairs
she
just
sat
in
her
dressing
gown
by
her
bedroom
fire
with
her
head
sunk
in
her
hands
mrs
allen
stayed
with
her
most
of
the
night
as
to
the
other
servants
they
had
all
gone
to
bed
and
the
alarm
did
not
reach
them
until
just
before
the
police
arrived
they
slept
at
the
extreme
back
of
the
house
and
could
not
possibly
have
heard
anything
so
far
the
housekeeper
could
add
nothing
on
cross
examination
save
lamentations
and
expressions
of
amazement
cecil
barker
succeeded
mrs
allen
as
witness
as
to
the
occurrences
of
the
night
before
he
had
very
little
to
add
to
what
he
had
already
told
the
police
personally
he
was
convinced
that
the
murderer
had
escaped
by
the
window
the
bloodstain
was
conclusive
in
his
opinion
on
that
point
besides
as
the
bridge
was
up
there
was
no
other
possible
way
of
escaping
he
could
not
explain
what
had
become
of
the
assassin
or
why
he
had
not
taken
his
bicycle
if
it
were
indeed
his
he
could
not
possibly
have
been
drowned
in
the
moat
which
was
at
no
place
more
than
three
feet
deep
in
his
own
mind
he
had
very
definite
theory
about
the
murder
douglas
was
reticent
man
and
there
were
some
chapters
in
his
life
of
which
he
never
spoke
he
had
emigrated
to
america
when
he
was
very
young
man
he
had
prospered
well
and
barker
had
first
met
him
in
california
where
they
had
become
partners
in
successful
mining
claim
at
place
called
benito
canyon
they
had
done
very
well
but
douglas
had
suddenly
sold
out
and
started
for
england
he
was
widower
at
that
time
barker
had
afterwards
realized
his
money
and
come
to
live
in
london
thus
they
had
renewed
their
friendship
douglas
had
given
him
the
impression
that
some
danger
was
hanging
over
his
head
and
he
had
always
looked
upon
his
sudden
departure
from
california
and
also
his
renting
house
in
so
quiet
place
in
england
as
being
connected
with
this
peril
he
imagined
that
some
secret
society
some
implacable
organization
was
on
douglas
track
which
would
never
rest
until
it
killed
him
some
remarks
of
his
had
given
him
this
idea
though
he
had
never
told
him
what
the
society
was
nor
how
he
had
come
to
offend
it
he
could
only
suppose
that
the
legend
upon
the
placard
had
some
reference
to
this
secret
society
how
long
were
you
with
douglas
in
california
asked
inspector
macDonald
five
years
altogether
he
was
bachelor
you
say
widower
have
you
ever
heard
where
his
first
wife
came
from
no
remember
his
saying
that
she
was
of
german
extraction
and
have
seen
her
portrait
she
was
very
beautiful
woman
she
died
of
typhoid
the
year
before
met
him
you
don
associate
his
past
with
any
particular
part
of
america
have
heard
him
talk
of
chicago
he
knew
that
city
well
and
had
worked
there
have
heard
him
talk
of
the
coal
and
iron
districts
he
had
travelled
good
deal
in
his
time
was
he
politician
had
this
secret
society
to
do
with
politics
no
he
cared
nothing
about
politics
you
have
no
reason
to
think
it
was
criminal
on
the
contrary
never
met
straighter
man
in
my
life
was
there
anything
curious
about
his
life
in
california
he
liked
best
to
stay
and
to
work
at
our
claim
in
the
mountains
he
would
never
go
where
other
men
were
if
he
could
help
it
that
why
first
thought
that
someone
was
after
him
then
when
he
left
so
suddenly
for
europe
made
sure
that
it
was
so
believe
that
he
had
warning
of
some
sort
within
week
of
his
leaving
half
dozen
men
were
inquiring
for
him
страница

what
sort
of
men
well
they
were
mighty
hard
looking
crowd
they
came
up
to
the
claim
and
wanted
to
know
where
he
was
told
them
that
he
was
gone
to
europe
and
that
did
not
know
where
to
find
him
they
meant
him
no
good
it
was
easy
to
see
that
were
these
men
americans
californians
well
don
know
about
californians
they
were
americans
all
right
but
they
were
not
miners
don
know
what
they
were
and
was
very
glad
to
see
their
backs
that
was
six
years
ago
nearer
seven
and
then
you
were
together
five
years
in
california
so
that
this
business
dates
back
not
less
than
eleven
years
at
the
least
that
is
so
it
must
be
very
serious
feud
that
would
be
kept
up
with
such
earnestness
for
as
long
as
that
it
would
be
no
light
thing
that
would
give
rise
to
it
think
it
shadowed
his
whole
life
it
was
never
quite
out
of
his
mind
but
if
man
had
danger
hanging
over
him
and
knew
what
it
was
don
you
think
he
would
turn
to
the
police
for
protection
maybe
it
was
some
danger
that
he
could
not
be
protected
against
there
one
thing
you
should
know
he
always
went
about
armed
his
revolver
was
never
out
of
his
pocket
but
by
bad
luck
he
was
in
his
dressing
gown
and
had
left
it
in
the
bedroom
last
night
once
the
bridge
was
up
guess
he
thought
he
was
safe
should
like
these
dates
little
clearer
said
macDonald
it
is
quite
six
years
since
douglas
left
california
you
followed
him
next
year
did
you
not
that
is
so
and
he
had
been
married
five
years
you
must
have
returned
about
the
time
of
his
marriage
about
month
before
was
his
best
man
did
you
know
mrs
douglas
before
her
marriage
no
did
not
had
been
away
from
england
for
ten
years
but
you
have
seen
good
deal
of
her
since
barker
looked
sternly
at
the
detective
have
seen
good
deal
of
him
since
he
answered
if
have
seen
her
it
is
because
you
cannot
visit
man
without
knowing
his
wife
if
you
imagine
there
is
any
connection
imagine
nothing
mr
barker
am
bound
to
make
every
inquiry
which
can
bear
upon
the
case
but
mean
no
offense
some
inquiries
are
offensive
barker
answered
angrily
it
only
the
facts
that
we
want
it
is
in
your
interest
and
everyone
interest
that
they
should
be
cleared
up
did
mr
douglas
entirely
approve
your
friendship
with
his
wife
barker
grew
paler
and
his
great
strong
hands
were
clasped
convulsively
together
you
have
no
right
to
ask
such
questions
he
cried
what
has
this
to
do
with
the
matter
you
are
investigating
must
repeat
the
question
well
refuse
to
answer
you
can
refuse
to
answer
but
you
must
be
aware
that
your
refusal
is
in
itself
an
answer
for
you
would
not
refuse
if
you
had
not
something
to
conceal
barker
stood
for
moment
with
his
face
set
grimly
and
his
strong
black
eyebrows
drawn
low
in
intense
thought
then
he
looked
up
with
smile
well
guess
you
gentlemen
are
only
doing
your
clear
duty
after
all
and
have
no
right
to
stand
in
the
way
of
it
only
ask
you
not
to
worry
mrs
douglas
over
this
matter
for
she
has
enough
upon
her
just
now
may
tell
you
that
poor
douglas
had
just
one
fault
in
the
world
and
that
was
his
jealousy
he
was
fond
of
me
no
man
could
be
fonder
of
friend
and
he
was
devoted
to
his
wife
he
loved
me
to
come
here
and
was
forever
sending
for
me
and
yet
if
his
wife
and
talked
together
or
there
seemed
any
sympathy
between
us
kind
of
wave
of
jealousy
would
pass
over
him
and
he
would
be
off
the
handle
and
saying
the
wildest
things
in
moment
more
than
once
ve
sworn
off
coming
for
that
reason
and
then
he
would
write
me
such
penitent
imploring
letters
that
just
had
to
but
you
can
take
it
from
me
gentlemen
if
it
was
my
last
word
that
no
man
ever
had
more
loving
faithful
wife
and
can
say
also
no
friend
could
be
more
loyal
than
it
was
spoken
with
fervour
and
feeling
and
yet
inspector
macDonald
could
not
dismiss
the
subject
you
are
aware
said
he
that
the
dead
man
wedding
ring
has
been
taken
from
his
finger
so
it
appears
said
barker
what
do
you
mean
by
appears
you
know
it
as
fact
the
man
seemed
confused
and
undecided
when
said
appears
meant
that
it
was
conceivable
that
he
had
himself
taken
off
the
ring
the
mere
fact
that
the
ring
should
be
absent
whoever
may
have
removed
it
would
suggest
to
anyone
mind
would
it
not
that
the
marriage
and
the
tragedy
were
connected
barker
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
can
profess
to
say
what
it
means
he
answered
but
if
you
mean
to
hint
that
it
could
reflect
in
any
way
upon
this
lady
honour
his
eyes
blazed
for
an
instant
and
then
with
an
evident
effort
he
got
grip
upon
his
own
emotions
well
you
are
on
the
wrong
track
that
all
don
know
that
ve
anything
else
to
ask
you
at
present
said
macDonald
coldly
there
was
one
small
point
remarked
sherlock
holmes
when
you
entered
the
room
there
was
only
candle
lighted
on
the
table
was
there
not
yes
that
was
so
by
its
light
you
saw
that
some
terrible
incident
had
occurred
exactly
you
at
once
rang
for
help
yes
and
it
arrived
very
speedily
within
minute
or
so
and
yet
when
they
arrived
they
found
that
the
candle
was
out
and
that
the
lamp
had
been
lighted
that
seems
very
remarkable
again
barker
showed
some
signs
of
indecision
don
see
that
it
was
remarkable
mr
holmes
he
answered
after
pause
the
candle
threw
very
bad
light
my
first
thought
was
to
get
better
one
the
lamp
was
on
the
table
so
lit
it
and
blew
out
the
candle
exactly
holmes
asked
no
further
question
and
barker
with
deliberate
look
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
which
had
as
it
seemed
to
me
something
of
defiance
in
it
turned
and
left
the
room
inspector
macDonald
had
sent
up
note
to
the
effect
that
he
would
wait
upon
mrs
douglas
in
her
room
but
she
had
replied
that
she
would
meet
us
in
the
dining
room
she
entered
now
tall
and
beautiful
woman
of
thirty
reserved
and
self
possessed
to
remarkable
degree
very
different
from
the
tragic
and
distracted
figure
had
pictured
it
is
true
that
her
face
was
pale
and
drawn
like
that
of
one
who
has
endured
great
shock
but
her
manner
was
composed
and
the
finely
moulded
hand
which
she
rested
upon
the
edge
of
the
table
was
as
steady
as
my
own
her
sad
appealing
eyes
travelled
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
with
curiously
inquisitive
expression
that
questioning
gaze
transformed
itself
suddenly
into
abrupt
speech
have
you
found
anything
out
yet
she
asked
was
it
my
imagination
that
there
was
an
undertone
of
fear
rather
than
of
hope
in
the
question
we
have
taken
every
possible
step
mrs
douglas
said
the
inspector
you
may
rest
assured
that
nothing
will
be
neglected
spare
no
money
she
said
in
dead
even
tone
it
is
my
desire
that
every
possible
effort
should
be
made
perhaps
you
can
tell
us
something
which
may
throw
some
light
upon
the
matter
fear
not
but
all
know
is
at
your
service
we
have
heard
from
mr
cecil
barker
that
you
did
not
actually
see
that
you
were
never
in
the
room
where
the
tragedy
occurred
no
he
turned
me
back
upon
the
stairs
he
begged
me
to
return
to
my
room
quite
so
you
had
heard
the
shot
and
you
had
at
once
come
down
put
on
my
dressing
gown
and
then
came
down
how
long
was
it
after
hearing
the
shot
that
you
were
stopped
on
the
stair
by
mr
barker
it
may
have
been
couple
of
minutes
it
is
so
hard
to
reckon
time
at
such
moment
he
implored
me
not
to
go
on
he
assured
me
that
could
do
nothing
then
mrs
allen
the
housekeeper
led
me
upstairs
again
it
was
all
like
some
dreadful
dream
can
you
give
us
any
idea
how
long
your
husband
had
been
downstairs
before
you
heard
the
shot
no
cannot
say
he
went
from
his
dressing
room
and
did
not
hear
him
go
he
did
the
round
of
the
house
every
night
for
he
was
nervous
of
fire
it
is
the
only
thing
that
have
ever
known
him
nervous
of
that
is
just
the
point
which
want
to
come
to
mrs
douglas
you
have
known
your
husband
only
in
england
have
you
not
yes
we
have
been
married
five
years
have
you
heard
him
speak
of
anything
which
occurred
in
america
and
might
bring
some
danger
upon
him
mrs
douglas
thought
earnestly
before
she
answered
yes
she
said
at
last
have
always
felt
that
there
was
danger
hanging
over
him
he
refused
to
discuss
it
with
me
it
was
not
from
want
of
confidence
in
me
there
was
the
most
complete
love
and
confidence
between
us
but
it
was
out
of
his
desire
to
keep
all
alarm
away
from
me
he
thought
should
brood
over
it
if
knew
all
and
so
he
was
silent

how
did
you
know
it
then
mrs
douglas
face
lit
with
quick
smile
can
husband
ever
carry
about
secret
all
his
life
and
woman
who
loves
him
have
no
suspicion
of
it
knew
it
by
his
refusal
to
talk
about
some
episodes
in
his
american
life
knew
it
by
certain
precautions
he
took
knew
it
by
certain
words
he
let
fall
knew
it
by
the
way
he
looked
at
unexpected
strangers
was
perfectly
certain
that
he
had
some
powerful
enemies
that
he
believed
they
were
on
his
track
and
that
he
was
always
on
his
guard
against
them
was
so
sure
of
it
that
for
years
have
been
terrified
if
ever
he
came
home
later
than
was
expected
might
ask
asked
holmes
what
the
words
were
which
attracted
your
attention
the
valley
of
fear
the
lady
answered
that
was
an
expression
he
has
used
when
questioned
him
have
been
in
the
valley
of
fear
am
not
out
of
it
yet
are
we
never
to
get
out
of
the
valley
of
fear
have
asked
him
when
have
seen
him
more
serious
than
usual
sometimes
think
that
we
never
shall
he
has
answered
surely
you
asked
him
what
he
meant
by
the
valley
of
fear
did
but
his
face
would
become
very
grave
and
he
would
shake
his
head
it
is
bad
enough
that
one
of
us
should
have
been
in
its
shadow
he
said
please
god
it
shall
never
fall
upon
you
it
was
some
real
valley
in
which
he
had
lived
and
in
which
something
terrible
had
occurred
to
him
of
that
am
certain
but
can
tell
you
no
more
and
he
never
mentioned
any
names
yes
he
was
delirious
with
fever
once
when
he
had
his
hunting
accident
three
years
ago
then
remember
that
there
was
name
that
came
continually
to
his
lips
he
spoke
it
with
anger
and
sort
of
horror
mcGinty
was
the
name
bodymaster
mcGinty
asked
him
when
he
recovered
who
bodymaster
mcGinty
was
and
whose
body
he
was
master
of
never
of
mine
thank
god
he
answered
with
laugh
and
that
was
all
could
get
from
him
but
there
is
connection
between
bodymaster
mcGinty
and
the
valley
of
fear
there
is
one
other
point
said
inspector
macDonald
you
met
mr
douglas
in
boarding
house
in
london
did
you
not
and
became
engaged
to
him
there
was
there
any
romance
anything
secret
or
mysterious
about
the
wedding
there
was
romance
there
is
always
romance
there
was
nothing
mysterious
he
had
no
rival
no
was
quite
free
you
have
heard
no
doubt
that
his
wedding
ring
has
been
taken
does
that
suggest
anything
to
you
suppose
that
some
enemy
of
his
old
life
had
tracked
him
down
and
committed
this
crime
what
possible
reason
could
he
have
for
taking
his
wedding
ring
for
an
instant
could
have
sworn
that
the
faintest
shadow
of
smile
flickered
over
the
woman
lips
really
cannot
tell
she
answered
it
is
certainly
most
extraordinary
thing
well
we
will
not
detain
you
any
longer
and
we
are
sorry
to
have
put
you
to
this
trouble
at
such
time
said
the
inspector
there
are
some
other
points
no
doubt
but
we
can
refer
to
you
as
they
arise
she
rose
and
was
again
conscious
of
that
quick
questioning
glance
with
which
she
had
just
surveyed
us
what
impression
has
my
evidence
made
upon
you
the
question
might
as
well
have
been
spoken
then
with
bow
she
swept
from
the
room
she
beautiful
woman
very
beautiful
woman
said
macDonald
thoughtfully
after
the
door
had
closed
behind
her
this
man
barker
has
certainly
been
down
here
good
deal
he
is
man
who
might
be
attractive
to
woman
he
admits
that
the
dead
man
was
jealous
and
maybe
he
knew
best
himself
what
cause
he
had
for
jealousy
then
there
that
wedding
ring
you
can
get
past
that
the
man
who
tears
wedding
ring
off
dead
man
what
do
you
say
to
it
mr
holmes
my
friend
had
sat
with
his
head
upon
his
hands
sunk
in
the
deepest
thought
now
he
rose
and
rang
the
bell
ames
he
said
when
the
butler
entered
where
is
mr
cecil
barker
now
ll
see
sir
he
came
back
in
moment
to
say
that
barker
was
in
the
garden
can
you
remember
ames
what
mr
barker
had
on
his
feet
last
night
when
you
joined
him
in
the
study
yes
mr
holmes
he
had
pair
of
bedroom
slippers
brought
him
his
boots
when
he
went
for
the
police
where
are
the
slippers
now
they
are
still
under
the
chair
in
the
hall
very
good
ames
it
is
of
course
important
for
us
to
know
which
tracks
may
be
mr
barker
and
which
from
outside
yes
sir
may
say
that
noticed
that
the
slippers
were
stained
with
blood
so
indeed
were
my
own
that
is
natural
enough
considering
the
condition
of
the
room
very
good
ames
we
will
ring
if
we
want
you
few
minutes
later
we
were
in
the
study
holmes
had
brought
with
him
the
carpet
slippers
from
the
hall
as
ames
had
observed
the
soles
of
both
were
dark
with
blood
strange
murmured
holmes
as
he
stood
in
the
light
of
the
window
and
examined
them
minutely
very
strange
indeed
stooping
with
one
of
his
quick
feline
pounces
he
placed
the
slipper
upon
the
blood
mark
on
the
sill
it
exactly
corresponded
he
smiled
in
silence
at
his
colleagues
the
inspector
was
transfigured
with
excitement
his
native
accent
rattled
like
stick
upon
railings
man
he
cried
there
not
doubt
of
it
barker
has
just
marked
the
window
himself
it
good
deal
broader
than
any
bootmark
mind
that
you
said
it
was
splay
foot
and
here
the
explanation
but
what
the
game
mr
holmes
what
the
game
ay
what
the
game
my
friend
repeated
thoughtfully
white
mason
chuckled
and
rubbed
his
fat
hands
together
in
his
professional
satisfaction
said
it
was
snorter
he
cried
and
real
snorter
it
is
vi
dawning
light
the
three
detectives
had
many
matters
of
detail
into
which
to
inquire
so
returned
alone
to
our
modest
quarters
at
the
village
inn
but
before
doing
so
took
stroll
in
the
curious
old
world
garden
which
flanked
the
house
rows
of
very
ancient
yew
trees
cut
into
strange
designs
girded
it
round
inside
was
beautiful
stretch
of
lawn
with
an
old
sundial
in
the
middle
the
whole
effect
so
soothing
and
restful
that
it
was
welcome
to
my
somewhat
jangled
nerves
in
that
deeply
peaceful
atmosphere
one
could
forget
or
remember
only
as
some
fantastic
nightmare
that
darkened
study
with
the
sprawling
bloodstained
figure
on
the
floor
and
yet
as
strolled
round
it
and
tried
to
steep
my
soul
in
its
gentle
balm
strange
incident
occurred
which
brought
me
back
to
the
tragedy
and
left
sinister
impression
in
my
mind
have
said
that
decoration
of
yew
trees
circled
the
garden
at
the
end
farthest
from
the
house
they
thickened
into
continuous
hedge
on
the
other
side
of
this
hedge
concealed
from
the
eyes
of
anyone
approaching
from
the
direction
of
the
house
there
was
stone
seat
as
approached
the
spot
was
aware
of
voices
some
remark
in
the
deep
tones
of
man
answered
by
little
ripple
of
feminine
laughter
an
instant
later
had
come
round
the
end
of
the
hedge
and
my
eyes
lit
upon
mrs
douglas
and
the
man
barker
before
they
were
aware
of
my
presence
her
appearance
gave
me
shock
in
the
dining
room
she
had
been
demure
and
discreet
now
all
pretense
of
grief
had
passed
away
from
her
eyes
shone
with
the
joy
of
living
and
her
face
still
quivered
with
amusement
at
some
remark
of
her
companion
he
sat
forward
his
hands
clasped
and
his
forearms
on
his
knees
with
an
answering
smile
upon
his
bold
handsome
face
in
an
instant
but
it
was
just
one
instant
too
late
they
resumed
their
solemn
masks
as
my
figure
came
into
view
hurried
word
or
two
passed
between
them
and
then
barker
rose
and
came
towards
me
excuse
me
sir
said
he
but
am
addressing
dr
watson
bowed
with
coldness
which
showed
dare
say
very
plainly
the
impression
which
had
been
produced
upon
my
mind
we
thought
that
it
was
probably
you
as
your
friendship
with
mr
sherlock
holmes
is
so
well
known
would
you
mind
coming
over
and
speaking
to
mrs
douglas
for
one
instant
followed
him
with
dour
face
very
clearly
could
see
in
my
mind
eye
that
shattered
figure
on
the
floor
here
within
few
hours
of
the
tragedy
were
his
wife
and
his
nearest
friend
laughing
together
behind
bush
in
the
garden
which
had
been
his
greeted
the
lady
with
reserve
had
grieved
with
her
grief
in
the
dining
room
now
met
her
appealing
gaze
with
an
unresponsive
eye
fear
that
you
think
me
callous
and
hard
hearted
said
she
shrugged
my
shoulders
it
is
no
business
of
mine
said
perhaps
some
day
you
will
do
me
justice
if
you
only
realized
there
is
no
need
why
dr
watson
should
realize
said
barker
quickly
as
he
has
himself
said
it
is
no
possible
business
of
his
exactly
said
and
so
will
beg
leave
to
resume
my
walk

one
moment
dr
watson
cried
the
woman
in
pleading
voice
there
is
one
question
which
you
can
answer
with
more
authority
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
and
it
may
make
very
great
difference
to
me
you
know
mr
holmes
and
his
relations
with
the
police
better
than
anyone
else
can
supposing
that
matter
were
brought
confidentially
to
his
knowledge
is
it
absolutely
necessary
that
he
should
pass
it
on
to
the
detectives
yes
that
it
said
barker
eagerly
is
he
on
his
own
or
is
he
entirely
in
with
them
really
don
know
that
should
be
justified
in
discussing
such
point
beg
implore
that
you
will
dr
watson
assure
you
that
you
will
be
helping
us
helping
me
greatly
if
you
will
guide
us
on
that
point
there
was
such
ring
of
sincerity
in
the
woman
voice
that
for
the
instant
forgot
all
about
her
levity
and
was
moved
only
to
do
her
will
mr
holmes
is
an
independent
investigator
said
he
is
his
own
master
and
would
act
as
his
own
judgment
directed
at
the
same
time
he
would
naturally
feel
loyalty
towards
the
officials
who
were
working
on
the
same
case
and
he
would
not
conceal
from
them
anything
which
would
help
them
in
bringing
criminal
to
justice
beyond
this
can
say
nothing
and
would
refer
you
to
mr
holmes
himself
if
you
wanted
fuller
information
so
saying
raised
my
hat
and
went
upon
my
way
leaving
them
still
seated
behind
that
concealing
hedge
looked
back
as
rounded
the
far
end
of
it
and
saw
that
they
were
still
talking
very
earnestly
together
and
as
they
were
gazing
after
me
it
was
clear
that
it
was
our
interview
that
was
the
subject
of
their
debate
wish
none
of
their
confidences
said
holmes
when
reported
to
him
what
had
occurred
he
had
spent
the
whole
afternoon
at
the
manor
house
in
consultation
with
his
two
colleagues
and
returned
about
five
with
ravenous
appetite
for
high
tea
which
had
ordered
for
him
no
confidences
watson
for
they
are
mighty
awkward
if
it
comes
to
an
arrest
for
conspiracy
and
murder
you
think
it
will
come
to
that
he
was
in
his
most
cheerful
and
debonair
humour
my
dear
watson
when
have
exterminated
that
fourth
egg
shall
be
ready
to
put
you
in
touch
with
the
whole
situation
don
say
that
we
have
fathomed
it
far
from
it
but
when
we
have
traced
the
missing
dumb
bell
the
dumb
bell
dear
me
watson
is
it
possible
that
you
have
not
penetrated
the
fact
that
the
case
hangs
upon
the
missing
dumb
bell
well
you
need
not
be
downcast
for
between
ourselves
don
think
that
either
inspector
mac
or
the
excellent
local
practitioner
has
grasped
the
overwhelming
importance
of
this
incident
one
dumb
bell
watson
consider
an
athlete
with
one
dumb
bell
picture
to
yourself
the
unilateral
development
the
imminent
danger
of
spinal
curvature
shocking
watson
shocking
he
sat
with
his
mouth
full
of
toast
and
his
eyes
sparkling
with
mischief
watching
my
intellectual
entanglement
the
mere
sight
of
his
excellent
appetite
was
an
assurance
of
success
for
had
very
clear
recollections
of
days
and
nights
without
thought
of
food
when
his
baffled
mind
had
chafed
before
some
problem
while
his
thin
eager
features
became
more
attenuated
with
the
asceticism
of
complete
mental
concentration
finally
he
lit
his
pipe
and
sitting
in
the
inglenook
of
the
old
village
inn
he
talked
slowly
and
at
random
about
his
case
rather
as
one
who
thinks
aloud
than
as
one
who
makes
considered
statement
lie
watson
great
big
thumping
obtrusive
uncompromising
lie
that
what
meets
us
on
the
threshold
there
is
our
starting
point
the
whole
story
told
by
barker
is
lie
but
barker
story
is
corroborated
by
mrs
douglas
therefore
she
is
lying
also
they
are
both
lying
and
in
conspiracy
so
now
we
have
the
clear
problem
why
are
they
lying
and
what
is
the
truth
which
they
are
trying
so
hard
to
conceal
let
us
try
watson
you
and
if
we
can
get
behind
the
lie
and
reconstruct
the
truth
how
do
know
that
they
are
lying
because
it
is
clumsy
fabrication
which
simply
could
not
be
true
consider
according
to
the
story
given
to
us
the
assassin
had
less
than
minute
after
the
murder
had
been
committed
to
take
that
ring
which
was
under
another
ring
from
the
dead
man
finger
to
replace
the
other
ring
thing
which
he
would
surely
never
have
done
and
to
put
that
singular
card
beside
his
victim
say
that
this
was
obviously
impossible
you
may
argue
but
have
too
much
respect
for
your
judgment
watson
to
think
that
you
will
do
so
that
the
ring
may
have
been
taken
before
the
man
was
killed
the
fact
that
the
candle
had
been
lit
only
short
time
shows
that
there
had
been
no
lengthy
interview
was
douglas
from
what
we
hear
of
his
fearless
character
man
who
would
be
likely
to
give
up
his
wedding
ring
at
such
short
notice
or
could
we
conceive
of
his
giving
it
up
at
all
no
watson
the
assassin
was
alone
with
the
dead
man
for
some
time
with
the
lamp
lit
of
that
have
no
doubt
at
all
but
the
gunshot
was
apparently
the
cause
of
death
therefore
the
shot
must
have
been
fired
some
time
earlier
than
we
are
told
but
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
such
matter
as
that
we
are
in
the
presence
therefore
of
deliberate
conspiracy
upon
the
part
of
the
two
people
who
heard
the
gunshot
of
the
man
barker
and
of
the
woman
douglas
when
on
the
top
of
this
am
able
to
show
that
the
blood
mark
on
the
windowsill
was
deliberately
placed
there
by
barker
in
order
to
give
false
clue
to
the
police
you
will
admit
that
the
case
grows
dark
against
him
now
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
at
what
hour
the
murder
actually
did
occur
up
to
half
past
ten
the
servants
were
moving
about
the
house
so
it
was
certainly
not
before
that
time
at
quarter
to
eleven
they
had
all
gone
to
their
rooms
with
the
exception
of
ames
who
was
in
the
pantry
have
been
trying
some
experiments
after
you
left
us
this
afternoon
and
find
that
no
noise
which
macDonald
can
make
in
the
study
can
penetrate
to
me
in
the
pantry
when
the
doors
are
all
shut
it
is
otherwise
however
from
the
housekeeper
room
it
is
not
so
far
down
the
corridor
and
from
it
could
vaguely
hear
voice
when
it
was
very
loudly
raised
the
sound
from
shotgun
is
to
some
extent
muffled
when
the
discharge
is
at
very
close
range
as
it
undoubtedly
was
in
this
instance
it
would
not
be
very
loud
and
yet
in
the
silence
of
the
night
it
should
have
easily
penetrated
to
mrs
allen
room
she
is
as
she
has
told
us
somewhat
deaf
but
none
the
less
she
mentioned
in
her
evidence
that
she
did
hear
something
like
door
slamming
half
an
hour
before
the
alarm
was
given
half
an
hour
before
the
alarm
was
given
would
be
quarter
to
eleven
have
no
doubt
that
what
she
heard
was
the
report
of
the
gun
and
that
this
was
the
real
instant
of
the
murder
if
this
is
so
we
have
now
to
determine
what
barker
and
mrs
douglas
presuming
that
they
are
not
the
actual
murderers
could
have
been
doing
from
quarter
to
eleven
when
the
sound
of
the
shot
brought
them
down
until
quarter
past
eleven
when
they
rang
the
bell
and
summoned
the
servants
what
were
they
doing
and
why
did
they
not
instantly
give
the
alarm
that
is
the
question
which
faces
us
and
when
it
has
been
answered
we
shall
surely
have
gone
some
way
to
solve
our
problem
am
convinced
myself
said
that
there
is
an
understanding
between
those
two
people
she
must
be
heartless
creature
to
sit
laughing
at
some
jest
within
few
hours
of
her
husband
murder
exactly
she
does
not
shine
as
wife
even
in
her
own
account
of
what
occurred
am
not
whole
souled
admirer
of
womankind
as
you
are
aware
watson
but
my
experience
of
life
has
taught
me
that
there
are
few
wives
having
any
regard
for
their
husbands
who
would
let
any
man
spoken
word
stand
between
them
and
that
husband
dead
body
should
ever
marry
watson
should
hope
to
inspire
my
wife
with
some
feeling
which
would
prevent
her
from
being
walked
off
by
housekeeper
when
my
corpse
was
lying
within
few
yards
of
her
it
was
badly
stage
managed
for
even
the
rawest
investigators
must
be
struck
by
the
absence
of
the
usual
feminine
ululation
if
there
had
been
nothing
else
this
incident
alone
would
have
suggested
prearranged
conspiracy
to
my
mind
you
think
then
definitely
that
barker
and
mrs
douglas
are
guilty
of
the
murder
there
is
an
appalling
directness
about
your
questions
watson
said
holmes
shaking
his
pipe
at
me
they
come
at
me
like
bullets
if
you
put
it
that
mrs
douglas
and
barker
know
the
truth
about
the
murder
and
are
conspiring
to
conceal
it
then
can
give
you
whole
souled
answer
am
sure
they
do
but
your
more
deadly
proposition
is
not
so
clear
let
us
for
moment
consider
the
difficulties
which
stand
in
the
way
we
will
suppose
that
this
couple
are
united
by
the
bonds
of
guilty
love
and
that
they
have
determined
to
get
rid
of
the
man
who
stands
between
them
it
is
large
supposition
for
discreet
inquiry
among
servants
and
others
has
failed
to
corroborate
it
in
any
way
on
the
contrary
there
is
good
deal
of
evidence
that
the
douglases
were
very
attached
to
each
other

that
am
sure
cannot
he
true
said
thinking
of
the
beautiful
smiling
face
in
the
garden
well
at
least
they
gave
that
impression
however
we
will
suppose
that
they
are
an
extraordinarily
astute
couple
who
deceive
everyone
upon
this
point
and
conspire
to
murder
the
husband
he
happens
to
be
man
over
whose
head
some
danger
hangs
we
have
only
their
word
for
that
holmes
looked
thoughtful
see
watson
you
are
sketching
out
theory
by
which
everything
they
say
from
the
beginning
is
false
according
to
your
idea
there
was
never
any
hidden
menace
or
secret
society
or
valley
of
fear
or
boss
macSomebody
or
anything
else
well
that
is
good
sweeping
generalization
let
us
see
what
that
brings
us
to
they
invent
this
theory
to
account
for
the
crime
they
then
play
up
to
the
idea
by
leaving
this
bicycle
in
the
park
as
proof
of
the
existence
of
some
outsider
the
stain
on
the
windowsill
conveys
the
same
idea
so
does
the
card
on
the
body
which
might
have
been
prepared
in
the
house
that
all
fits
into
your
hypothesis
watson
but
now
we
come
on
the
nasty
angular
uncompromising
bits
which
won
slip
into
their
places
why
cut
off
shotgun
of
all
weapons
and
an
american
one
at
that
how
could
they
be
so
sure
that
the
sound
of
it
would
not
bring
someone
on
to
them
it
mere
chance
as
it
is
that
mrs
allen
did
not
start
out
to
inquire
for
the
slamming
door
why
did
your
guilty
couple
do
all
this
watson
confess
that
can
explain
it
then
again
if
woman
and
her
lover
conspire
to
murder
husband
are
they
going
to
advertise
their
guilt
by
ostentatiously
removing
his
wedding
ring
after
his
death
does
that
strike
you
as
very
probable
watson
no
it
does
not
and
once
again
if
the
thought
of
leaving
bicycle
concealed
outside
had
occurred
to
you
would
it
really
have
seemed
worth
doing
when
the
dullest
detective
would
naturally
say
this
is
an
obvious
blind
as
the
bicycle
is
the
first
thing
which
the
fugitive
needed
in
order
to
make
his
escape
can
conceive
of
no
explanation
and
yet
there
should
be
no
combination
of
events
for
which
the
wit
of
man
cannot
conceive
an
explanation
simply
as
mental
exercise
without
any
assertion
that
it
is
true
let
me
indicate
possible
line
of
thought
it
is
admit
mere
imagination
but
how
often
is
imagination
the
mother
of
truth
we
will
suppose
that
there
was
guilty
secret
really
shameful
secret
in
the
life
of
this
man
douglas
this
leads
to
his
murder
by
someone
who
is
we
will
suppose
an
avenger
someone
from
outside
this
avenger
for
some
reason
which
confess
am
still
at
loss
to
explain
took
the
dead
man
wedding
ring
the
vendetta
might
conceivably
date
back
to
the
man
first
marriage
and
the
ring
be
taken
for
some
such
reason
before
this
avenger
got
away
barker
and
the
wife
had
reached
the
room
the
assassin
convinced
them
that
any
attempt
to
arrest
him
would
lead
to
the
publication
of
some
hideous
scandal
they
were
converted
to
this
idea
and
preferred
to
let
him
go
for
this
purpose
they
probably
lowered
the
bridge
which
can
be
done
quite
noiselessly
and
then
raised
it
again
he
made
his
escape
and
for
some
reason
thought
that
he
could
do
so
more
safely
on
foot
than
on
the
bicycle
he
therefore
left
his
machine
where
it
would
not
be
discovered
until
he
had
got
safely
away
so
far
we
are
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
are
we
not
well
it
is
possible
no
doubt
said
with
some
reserve
we
have
to
remember
watson
that
whatever
occurred
is
certainly
something
very
extraordinary
well
now
to
continue
our
supposititious
case
the
couple
not
necessarily
guilty
couple
realize
after
the
murderer
is
gone
that
they
have
placed
themselves
in
position
in
which
it
may
be
difficult
for
them
to
prove
that
they
did
not
themselves
either
do
the
deed
or
connive
at
it
they
rapidly
and
rather
clumsily
met
the
situation
the
mark
was
put
by
barker
bloodstained
slipper
upon
the
windowsill
to
suggest
how
the
fugitive
got
away
they
obviously
were
the
two
who
must
have
heard
the
sound
of
the
gun
so
they
gave
the
alarm
exactly
as
they
would
have
done
but
good
half
hour
after
the
event
and
how
do
you
propose
to
prove
all
this
well
if
there
were
an
outsider
he
may
be
traced
and
taken
that
would
be
the
most
effective
of
all
proofs
but
if
not
well
the
resources
of
science
are
far
from
being
exhausted
think
that
an
evening
alone
in
that
study
would
help
me
much
an
evening
alone
propose
to
go
up
there
presently
have
arranged
it
with
the
estimable
ames
who
is
by
no
means
whole
hearted
about
barker
shall
sit
in
that
room
and
see
if
its
atmosphere
brings
me
inspiration
believer
in
the
genius
loci
you
smile
friend
watson
well
we
shall
see
by
the
way
you
have
that
big
umbrella
of
yours
have
you
not
it
is
here
well
ll
borrow
that
if
may
certainly
but
what
wretched
weapon
if
there
is
danger
nothing
serious
my
dear
watson
or
should
certainly
ask
for
your
assistance
but
ll
take
the
umbrella
at
present
am
only
awaiting
the
return
of
our
colleagues
from
tunbridge
wells
where
they
are
at
present
engaged
in
trying
for
likely
owner
to
the
bicycle
it
was
nightfall
before
inspector
macDonald
and
white
mason
came
back
from
their
expedition
and
they
arrived
exultant
reporting
great
advance
in
our
investigation
man
ll
admeet
that
had
my
doubts
if
there
was
ever
an
outsider
said
macDonald
but
that
all
past
now
we
ve
had
the
bicycle
identified
and
we
have
description
of
our
man
so
that
long
step
on
our
journey
it
sounds
to
me
like
the
beginning
of
the
end
said
holmes
sure
congratulate
you
both
with
all
my
heart
well
started
from
the
fact
that
mr
douglas
had
seemed
disturbed
since
the
day
before
when
he
had
been
at
tunbridge
wells
it
was
at
tunbridge
wells
then
that
he
had
become
conscious
of
some
danger
it
was
clear
therefore
that
if
man
had
come
over
with
bicycle
it
was
from
tunbridge
wells
that
he
might
be
expected
to
have
come
we
took
the
bicycle
over
with
us
and
showed
it
at
the
hotels
it
was
identified
at
once
by
the
manager
of
the
eagle
commercial
as
belonging
to
man
named
hargrave
who
had
taken
room
there
two
days
before
this
bicycle
and
small
valise
were
his
whole
belongings
he
had
registered
his
name
as
coming
from
london
but
had
given
no
address
the
valise
was
london
made
and
the
contents
were
british
but
the
man
himself
was
undoubtedly
an
american
well
said
holmes
gleefully
you
have
indeed
done
some
solid
work
while
have
been
sitting
spinning
theories
with
my
friend
it
lesson
in
being
practical
mr
mac
ay
it
just
that
mr
holmes
said
the
inspector
with
satisfaction
but
this
may
all
fit
in
with
your
theories
remarked
that
may
or
may
not
be
but
let
us
hear
the
end
mr
mac
was
there
nothing
to
identify
this
man
so
little
that
it
was
evident
that
he
had
carefully
guarded
himself
against
identification
there
were
no
papers
or
letters
and
no
marking
upon
the
clothes
cycle
map
of
the
county
lay
on
his
bedroom
table
he
had
left
the
hotel
after
breakfast
yesterday
morning
on
his
bicycle
and
no
more
was
heard
of
him
until
our
inquiries
that
what
puzzles
me
mr
holmes
said
white
mason
if
the
fellow
did
not
want
the
hue
and
cry
raised
over
him
one
would
imagine
that
he
would
have
returned
and
remained
at
the
hotel
as
an
inoffensive
tourist
as
it
is
he
must
know
that
he
will
be
reported
to
the
police
by
the
hotel
manager
and
that
his
disappearance
will
be
connected
with
the
murder
so
one
would
imagine
still
he
has
been
justified
of
his
wisdom
up
to
date
at
any
rate
since
he
has
not
been
taken
but
his
description
what
of
that
macDonald
referred
to
his
notebook
here
we
have
it
so
far
as
they
could
give
it
they
don
seem
to
have
taken
any
very
particular
stock
of
him
but
still
the
porter
the
clerk
and
the
chambermaid
are
all
agreed
that
this
about
covers
the
points
he
was
man
about
five
foot
nine
in
height
fifty
or
so
years
of
age
his
hair
slightly
grizzled
greyish
moustache
curved
nose
and
face
which
all
of
them
described
as
fierce
and
forbidding
well
bar
the
expression
that
might
almost
be
description
of
douglas
himself
said
holmes
he
is
just
over
fifty
with
grizzled
hair
and
moustache
and
about
the
same
height
did
you
get
anything
else
he
was
dressed
in
heavy
grey
suit
with
reefer
jacket
and
he
wore
short
yellow
overcoat
and
soft
cap
what
about
the
shotgun
it
is
less
than
two
feet
long
it
could
very
well
have
fitted
into
his
valise
he
could
have
carried
it
inside
his
overcoat
without
difficulty
and
how
do
you
consider
that
all
this
bears
upon
the
general
case
well
mr
holmes
said
macDonald
when
we
have
got
our
man
and
you
may
be
sure
that
had
his
description
on
the
wires
within
five
minutes
of
hearing
it
we
shall
be
better
able
to
judge
but
even
as
it
stands
we
have
surely
gone
long
way
we
know
that
an
american
calling
himself
hargrave
came
to
tunbridge
wells
two
days
ago
with
bicycle
and
valise
in
the
latter
was
sawed
off
shotgun
so
he
came
with
the
deliberate
purpose
of
crime
yesterday
morning
he
set
off
for
this
place
on
his
bicycle
with
his
gun
concealed
in
his
overcoat
no
one
saw
him
arrive
so
far
as
we
can
learn
but
he
need
not
pass
through
the
village
to
reach
the
park
gates
and
there
are
many
cyclists
upon
the
road
presumably
he
at
once
concealed
his
cycle
among
the
laurels
where
it
was
found
and
possibly
lurked
there
himself
with
his
eye
on
the
house
waiting
for
mr
douglas
to
come
out
the
shotgun
is
strange
weapon
to
use
inside
house
but
he
had
intended
to
use
it
outside
and
there
it
has
very
obvious
advantages
as
it
would
be
impossible
to
miss
with
it
and
the
sound
of
shots
is
so
common
in
an
english
sporting
neighbourhood
that
no
particular
notice
would
be
taken

that
is
all
very
clear
said
holmes
well
mr
douglas
did
not
appear
what
was
he
to
do
next
he
left
his
bicycle
and
approached
the
house
in
the
twilight
he
found
the
bridge
down
and
no
one
about
he
took
his
chance
intending
no
doubt
to
make
some
excuse
if
he
met
anyone
he
met
no
one
he
slipped
into
the
first
room
that
he
saw
and
concealed
himself
behind
the
curtain
thence
he
could
see
the
drawbridge
go
up
and
he
knew
that
his
only
escape
was
through
the
moat
he
waited
until
quarter
past
eleven
when
mr
douglas
upon
his
usual
nightly
round
came
into
the
room
he
shot
him
and
escaped
as
arranged
he
was
aware
that
the
bicycle
would
be
described
by
the
hotel
people
and
be
clue
against
him
so
he
left
it
there
and
made
his
way
by
some
other
means
to
london
or
to
some
safe
hiding
place
which
he
had
already
arranged
how
is
that
mr
holmes
well
mr
mac
it
is
very
good
and
very
clear
so
far
as
it
goes
that
is
your
end
of
the
story
my
end
is
that
the
crime
was
committed
half
an
hour
earlier
than
reported
that
mrs
douglas
and
barker
are
both
in
conspiracy
to
conceal
something
that
they
aided
the
murderer
escape
or
at
least
that
they
reached
the
room
before
he
escaped
and
that
they
fabricated
evidence
of
his
escape
through
the
window
whereas
in
all
probability
they
had
themselves
let
him
go
by
lowering
the
bridge
that
my
reading
of
the
first
half
the
two
detectives
shook
their
heads
well
mr
holmes
if
this
is
true
we
only
tumble
out
of
one
mystery
into
another
said
the
london
inspector
and
in
some
ways
worse
one
added
white
mason
the
lady
has
never
been
in
america
in
all
her
life
what
possible
connection
could
she
have
with
an
american
assassin
which
would
cause
her
to
shelter
him
freely
admit
the
difficulties
said
holmes
propose
to
make
little
investigation
of
my
own
to
night
and
it
is
just
possible
that
it
may
contribute
something
to
the
common
cause
can
we
help
you
mr
holmes
no
darkness
and
dr
watson
umbrella
my
wants
are
simple
and
ames
the
faithful
ames
no
doubt
he
will
stretch
point
for
me
all
my
lines
of
thought
lead
me
back
invariably
to
the
one
basic
question
why
should
an
athletic
man
develop
his
frame
upon
so
unnatural
an
instrument
as
single
dumb
bell
it
was
late
that
night
when
holmes
returned
from
his
solitary
excursion
we
slept
in
double
bedded
room
which
was
the
best
that
the
little
country
inn
could
do
for
us
was
already
asleep
when
was
partly
awakened
by
his
entrance
well
holmes
murmured
have
you
found
anything
out
he
stood
beside
me
in
silence
his
candle
in
his
hand
then
the
tall
lean
figure
inclined
towards
me
say
watson
he
whispered
would
you
be
afraid
to
sleep
in
the
same
room
with
lunatic
man
with
softening
of
the
brain
an
idiot
whose
mind
has
lost
its
grip
not
in
the
least
answered
in
astonishment
ah
that
lucky
he
said
and
not
another
word
would
he
utter
that
night
vii
the
solution
next
morning
after
breakfast
we
found
inspector
macDonald
and
white
mason
seated
in
close
consultation
in
the
small
parlour
of
the
local
police
sergeant
on
the
table
in
front
of
them
were
piled
number
of
letters
and
telegrams
which
they
were
carefully
sorting
and
docketing
three
had
been
placed
on
one
side
still
on
the
track
of
the
elusive
bicyclist
holmes
asked
cheerfully
what
is
the
latest
news
of
the
ruffian
macDonald
pointed
ruefully
to
his
heap
of
correspondence
he
is
at
present
reported
from
leicester
nottingham
southampton
derby
east
ham
richmond
and
fourteen
other
places
in
three
of
them
east
ham
leicester
and
liverpool
there
is
clear
case
against
him
and
he
has
actually
been
arrested
the
country
seems
to
be
full
of
the
fugitives
with
yellow
coats
dear
me
said
holmes
sympathetically
now
mr
mac
and
you
mr
white
mason
wish
to
give
you
very
earnest
piece
of
advice
when
went
into
this
case
with
you
bargained
as
you
will
no
doubt
remember
that
should
not
present
you
with
half
proved
theories
but
that
should
retain
and
work
out
my
own
ideas
until
had
satisfied
myself
that
they
were
correct
for
this
reason
am
not
at
the
present
moment
telling
you
all
that
is
in
my
mind
on
the
other
hand
said
that
would
play
the
game
fairly
by
you
and
do
not
think
it
is
fair
game
to
allow
you
for
one
unnecessary
moment
to
waste
your
energies
upon
profitless
task
therefore
am
here
to
advise
you
this
morning
and
my
advice
to
you
is
summed
up
in
three
words
abandon
the
case
macDonald
and
white
mason
stared
in
amazement
at
their
celebrated
colleague
you
consider
it
hopeless
cried
the
inspector
consider
your
case
to
be
hopeless
do
not
consider
that
it
is
hopeless
to
arrive
at
the
truth
but
this
cyclist
he
is
not
an
invention
we
have
his
description
his
valise
his
bicycle
the
fellow
must
be
somewhere
why
should
we
not
get
him
yes
no
doubt
he
is
somewhere
and
no
doubt
we
shall
get
him
but
would
not
have
you
waste
your
energies
in
east
ham
or
liverpool
am
sure
that
we
can
find
some
shorter
cut
to
result
you
are
holding
something
back
it
hardly
fair
of
you
mr
holmes
the
inspector
was
annoyed
you
know
my
methods
of
work
mr
mac
but
will
hold
it
back
for
the
shortest
time
possible
only
wish
to
verify
my
details
in
one
way
which
can
very
readily
be
done
and
then
make
my
bow
and
return
to
london
leaving
my
results
entirely
at
your
service
owe
you
too
much
to
act
otherwise
for
in
all
my
experience
cannot
recall
any
more
singular
and
interesting
study
this
is
clean
beyond
me
mr
holmes
we
saw
you
when
we
returned
from
tunbridge
wells
last
night
and
you
were
in
general
agreement
with
our
results
what
has
happened
since
then
to
give
you
completely
new
idea
of
the
case
well
since
you
ask
me
spent
as
told
you
that
would
some
hours
last
night
at
the
manor
house
well
what
happened
ah
can
only
give
you
very
general
answer
to
that
for
the
moment
by
the
way
have
been
reading
short
but
clear
and
interesting
account
of
the
old
building
purchasable
at
the
modest
sum
of
one
penny
from
the
local
tobacconist
here
holmes
drew
small
tract
embellished
with
rude
engraving
of
the
ancient
manor
house
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
it
immensely
adds
to
the
zest
of
an
investigation
my
dear
mr
mac
when
one
is
in
conscious
sympathy
with
the
historical
atmosphere
of
one
surroundings
don
look
so
impatient
for
assure
you
that
even
so
bald
an
account
as
this
raises
some
sort
of
picture
of
the
past
in
one
mind
permit
me
to
give
you
sample
erected
in
the
fifth
year
of
the
reign
of
james
and
standing
upon
the
site
of
much
older
building
the
manor
house
of
birlstone
presents
one
of
the
finest
surviving
examples
of
the
moated
jacobean
residence
you
are
making
fools
of
us
mr
holmes
tut
mr
mac
the
first
sign
of
temper
have
detected
in
you
well
won
read
it
verbatim
since
you
feel
so
strongly
upon
the
subject
but
when
tell
you
that
there
is
some
account
of
the
taking
of
the
place
by
parliamentary
colonel
in
1644
of
the
concealment
of
charles
for
several
days
in
the
course
of
the
civil
war
and
finally
of
visit
there
by
the
second
george
you
will
admit
that
there
are
various
associations
of
interest
connected
with
this
ancient
house
don
doubt
it
mr
holmes
but
that
is
no
business
of
ours
is
it
not
is
it
not
breadth
of
view
my
dear
mr
mac
is
one
of
the
essentials
of
our
profession
the
interplay
of
ideas
and
the
oblique
uses
of
knowledge
are
often
of
extraordinary
interest
you
will
excuse
these
remarks
from
one
who
though
mere
connoisseur
of
crime
is
still
rather
older
and
perhaps
more
experienced
than
yourself
the
first
to
admit
that
said
the
detective
heartily
you
get
to
your
point
admit
but
you
have
such
deuced
round
thecorner
way
of
doing
it
well
ll
drop
past
history
and
get
down
to
presentday
facts
called
last
night
as
have
already
said
at
the
manor
house
did
not
see
either
barker
or
mrs
douglas
saw
no
necessity
to
disturb
them
but
was
pleased
to
hear
that
the
lady
was
not
visibly
pining
and
that
she
had
partaken
of
an
excellent
dinner
my
visit
was
specially
made
to
the
good
mr
ames
with
whom
exchanged
some
amiabilities
which
culminated
in
his
allowing
me
without
reference
to
anyone
else
to
sit
alone
for
time
in
the
study
what
with
that
ejaculated
no
everything
is
now
in
order
you
gave
permission
for
that
mr
mac
as
am
informed
the
room
was
in
its
normal
state
and
in
it
passed
an
instructive
quarter
of
an
hour
what
were
you
doing
well
not
to
make
mystery
of
so
simple
matter
was
looking
for
the
missing
dumb
bell
it
has
always
bulked
rather
large
in
my
estimate
of
the
case
ended
by
finding
it

where
ah
there
we
come
to
the
edge
of
the
unexplored
let
me
go
little
further
very
little
further
and
will
promise
that
you
shall
share
everything
that
know
well
we
re
bound
to
take
you
on
your
own
terms
said
the
inspector
but
when
it
comes
to
telling
us
to
abandon
the
case
why
in
the
name
of
goodness
should
we
abandon
the
case
for
the
simple
reason
my
dear
mr
mac
that
you
have
not
got
the
first
idea
what
it
is
that
you
are
investigating
we
are
investigating
the
murder
of
mr
john
douglas
of
birlstone
manor
yes
so
you
are
but
don
trouble
to
trace
the
mysterious
gentleman
upon
the
bicycle
assure
you
that
it
won
help
you
then
what
do
you
suggest
that
we
do
will
tell
you
exactly
what
to
do
if
you
will
do
it
well
bound
to
say
ve
always
found
you
had
reason
behind
all
your
queer
ways
ll
do
what
you
advise
and
you
mr
white
mason
the
country
detective
looked
helplessly
from
one
to
the
other
holmes
and
his
methods
were
new
to
him
well
if
it
is
good
enough
for
the
inspector
it
is
good
enough
for
me
he
said
at
last
capital
said
holmes
well
then
should
recommend
nice
cheery
country
walk
for
both
of
you
they
tell
me
that
the
views
from
birlstone
ridge
over
the
weald
are
very
remarkable
no
doubt
lunch
could
be
got
at
some
suitable
hostelry
though
my
ignorance
of
the
country
prevents
me
from
recommending
one
in
the
evening
tired
but
happy
man
this
is
getting
past
joke
cried
macDonald
rising
angrily
from
his
chair
well
spend
the
day
as
you
like
said
holmes
patting
him
cheerfully
upon
the
shoulder
do
what
you
like
and
go
where
you
will
but
meet
me
here
before
dusk
without
fail
without
fail
mr
mac
that
sounds
more
like
sanity
all
of
it
was
excellent
advice
but
don
insist
so
long
as
you
are
here
when
need
you
but
now
before
we
part
want
you
to
write
note
to
mr
barker
well
ll
dictate
it
if
you
like
ready
dear
sir
it
has
struck
me
that
it
is
our
duty
to
drain
the
moat
in
the
hope
that
we
may
find
some
it
impossible
said
the
inspector
ve
made
inquiry
tut
my
dear
sir
please
do
what
ask
you
well
go
on
in
the
hope
that
we
may
find
something
which
may
bear
upon
our
investigation
have
made
arrangements
and
the
workmen
will
be
at
work
early
to
morrow
morning
diverting
the
stream
impossible
diverting
the
stream
so
thought
it
best
to
explain
matters
beforehand
now
sign
that
and
send
it
by
hand
about
four
clock
at
that
hour
we
shall
meet
again
in
this
room
until
then
we
may
each
do
what
we
like
for
can
assure
you
that
this
inquiry
has
come
to
definite
pause
evening
was
drawing
in
when
we
reassembled
holmes
was
very
serious
in
his
manner
myself
curious
and
the
detectives
obviously
critical
and
annoyed
well
gentlemen
said
my
friend
gravely
am
asking
you
now
to
put
everything
to
the
test
with
me
and
you
will
judge
for
yourselves
whether
the
observations
have
made
justify
the
conclusions
to
which
have
come
it
is
chill
evening
and
do
not
know
how
long
our
expedition
may
last
so
beg
that
you
will
wear
your
warmest
coats
it
is
of
the
first
importance
that
we
should
be
in
our
places
before
it
grows
dark
so
with
your
permission
we
shall
get
started
at
once
we
passed
along
the
outer
bounds
of
the
manor
house
park
until
we
came
to
place
where
there
was
gap
in
the
rails
which
fenced
it
through
this
we
slipped
and
then
in
the
gathering
gloom
we
followed
holmes
until
we
had
reached
shrubbery
which
lies
nearly
opposite
to
the
main
door
and
the
drawbridge
the
latter
had
not
been
raised
holmes
crouched
down
behind
the
screen
of
laurels
and
we
all
three
followed
his
example
well
what
are
we
to
do
now
asked
macDonald
with
some
gruffness
possess
our
souls
in
patience
and
make
as
little
noise
as
possible
holmes
answered
what
are
we
here
for
at
all
really
think
that
you
might
treat
us
with
more
frankness
holmes
laughed
watson
insists
that
am
the
dramatist
in
real
life
said
he
some
touch
of
the
artist
wells
up
within
me
and
calls
insistently
for
well
staged
performance
surely
our
profession
mr
mac
would
be
drab
and
sordid
one
if
we
did
not
sometimes
set
the
scene
so
as
to
glorify
our
results
the
blunt
accusation
the
brutal
tap
upon
the
shoulder
what
can
one
make
of
such
denouement
but
the
quick
inference
the
subtle
trap
the
clever
forecast
of
coming
events
the
triumphant
vindication
of
bold
theories
are
these
not
the
pride
and
the
justification
of
our
life
work
at
the
present
moment
you
thrill
with
the
glamour
of
the
situation
and
the
anticipation
of
the
hunt
where
would
be
that
thrill
if
had
been
as
definite
as
timetable
only
ask
little
patience
mr
mac
and
all
will
be
clear
to
you
well
hope
the
pride
and
justification
and
the
rest
of
it
will
come
before
we
all
get
our
death
of
cold
said
the
london
detective
with
comic
resignation
we
all
had
good
reason
to
join
in
the
aspiration
for
our
vigil
was
long
and
bitter
one
slowly
the
shadows
darkened
over
the
long
sombre
face
of
the
old
house
cold
damp
reek
from
the
moat
chilled
us
to
the
bones
and
set
our
teeth
chattering
there
was
single
lamp
over
the
gateway
and
steady
globe
of
light
in
the
fatal
study
everything
else
was
dark
and
still
how
long
is
this
to
last
asked
the
inspector
finally
and
what
is
it
we
are
watching
for
have
no
more
notion
than
you
how
long
it
is
to
last
holmes
answered
with
some
asperity
if
criminals
would
always
schedule
their
movements
like
railway
trains
it
would
certainly
be
more
convenient
for
all
of
us
as
to
what
it
is
we
well
that
what
we
are
watching
for
as
he
spoke
the
bright
yellow
light
in
the
study
was
obscured
by
somebody
passing
to
and
fro
before
it
the
laurels
among
which
we
lay
were
immediately
opposite
the
window
and
not
more
than
hundred
feet
from
it
presently
it
was
thrown
open
with
whining
of
hinges
and
we
could
dimly
see
the
dark
outline
of
man
head
and
shoulders
looking
out
into
the
gloom
for
some
minutes
he
peered
forth
in
furtive
stealthy
fashion
as
one
who
wishes
to
be
assured
that
he
is
unobserved
then
he
leaned
forward
and
in
the
intense
silence
we
were
aware
of
the
soft
lapping
of
agitated
water
he
seemed
to
be
stirring
up
the
moat
with
something
which
he
held
in
his
hand
then
suddenly
he
hauled
something
in
as
fisherman
lands
fish
some
large
round
object
which
obscured
the
light
as
it
was
dragged
through
the
open
casement
now
cried
holmes
now
we
were
all
upon
our
feet
staggering
after
him
with
our
stiffened
limbs
while
he
ran
swiftly
across
the
bridge
and
rang
violently
at
the
bell
there
was
the
rasping
of
bolts
from
the
other
side
and
the
amazed
ames
stood
in
the
entrance
holmes
brushed
him
aside
without
word
and
followed
by
all
of
us
rushed
into
the
room
which
had
been
occupied
by
the
man
whom
we
had
been
watching
the
oil
lamp
on
the
table
represented
the
glow
which
we
had
seen
from
outside
it
was
now
in
the
hand
of
cecil
barker
who
held
it
towards
us
as
we
entered
its
light
shone
upon
his
strong
resolute
clean
shaved
face
and
his
menacing
eyes
what
the
devil
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
he
cried
what
are
you
after
anyhow
holmes
took
swift
glance
round
and
then
pounced
upon
sodden
bundle
tied
together
with
cord
which
lay
where
it
had
been
thrust
under
the
writing
table
this
is
what
we
are
after
mr
barker
this
bundle
weighted
with
dumb
bell
which
you
have
just
raised
from
the
bottom
of
the
moat
barker
stared
at
holmes
with
amazement
in
his
face
how
in
thunder
came
you
to
know
anything
about
it
he
asked
simply
that
put
it
there
you
put
it
there
you
perhaps
should
have
said
replaced
it
there
said
holmes
you
will
remember
inspector
macDonald
that
was
somewhat
struck
by
the
absence
of
dumb
bell
drew
your
attention
to
it
but
with
the
pressure
of
other
events
you
had
hardly
the
time
to
give
it
the
consideration
which
would
have
enabled
you
to
draw
deductions
from
it
when
water
is
near
and
weight
is
missing
it
is
not
very
far
fetched
supposition
that
something
has
been
sunk
in
the
water
the
idea
was
at
least
worth
testing
so
with
the
help
of
ames
who
admitted
me
to
the
room
and
the
crook
of
dr
watson
umbrella
was
able
last
night
to
fish
up
and
inspect
this
bundle
it
was
of
the
first
importance
however
that
we
should
be
able
to
prove
who
placed
it
there
this
we
accomplished
by
the
very
obvious
device
of
announcing
that
the
moat
would
be
dried
to
morrow
which
had
of
course
the
effect
that
whoever
had
hidden
the
bundle
would
most
certainly
withdraw
it
the
moment
that
darkness
enabled
him
to
do
so
we
have
no
less
than
four
witnesses
as
to
who
it
was
who
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
and
so
mr
barker
think
the
word
lies
now
with
you

sherlock
holmes
put
the
sopping
bundle
upon
the
table
beside
the
lamp
and
undid
the
cord
which
bound
it
from
within
he
extracted
dumb
bell
which
he
tossed
down
to
its
fellow
in
the
corner
next
he
drew
forth
pair
of
boots
american
as
you
perceive
he
remarked
pointing
to
the
toes
then
he
laid
upon
the
table
long
deadly
sheathed
knife
finally
he
unravelled
bundle
of
clothing
comprising
complete
set
of
underclothes
socks
grey
tweed
suit
and
short
yellow
overcoat
the
clothes
are
commonplace
remarked
holmes
save
only
the
overcoat
which
is
full
of
suggestive
touches
he
held
it
tenderly
towards
the
light
here
as
you
perceive
is
the
inner
pocket
prolonged
into
the
lining
in
such
fashion
as
to
give
ample
space
for
the
truncated
fowling
piece
the
tailor
tab
is
on
the
neck
neal
outfitter
vermissa
have
spent
an
instructive
afternoon
in
the
rector
library
and
have
enlarged
my
knowledge
by
adding
the
fact
that
vermissa
is
flourishing
little
town
at
the
head
of
one
of
the
best
known
coal
and
iron
valleys
in
the
united
states
have
some
recollection
mr
barker
that
you
associated
the
coal
districts
with
mr
douglas
first
wife
and
it
would
surely
not
be
too
far
fetched
an
inference
that
the
upon
the
card
by
the
dead
body
might
stand
for
vermissa
valley
or
that
this
very
valley
which
sends
forth
emissaries
of
murder
may
be
that
valley
of
fear
of
which
we
have
heard
so
much
is
fairly
clear
and
now
mr
barker
seem
to
be
standing
rather
in
the
way
of
your
explanation
it
was
sight
to
see
cecil
barker
expressive
face
during
this
exposition
of
the
great
detective
anger
amazement
consternation
and
indecision
swept
over
it
in
turn
finally
he
took
refuge
in
somewhat
acrid
irony
you
know
such
lot
mr
holmes
perhaps
you
had
better
tell
us
some
more
he
sneered
have
no
doubt
that
could
tell
you
great
deal
more
mr
barker
but
it
would
come
with
better
grace
from
you
oh
you
think
so
do
you
well
all
can
say
is
that
if
there
any
secret
here
it
is
not
my
secret
and
am
not
the
man
to
give
it
away
well
if
you
take
that
line
mr
barker
said
the
inspector
quietly
we
must
just
keep
you
in
sight
until
we
have
the
warrant
and
can
hold
you
can
do
what
you
damn
please
about
that
said
barker
defiantly
the
proceedings
seemed
to
have
come
to
definite
end
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
for
one
had
only
to
look
at
that
granite
face
to
realize
that
no
peine
forte
et
dure
would
ever
force
him
to
plead
against
his
will
the
deadlock
was
broken
however
by
woman
voice
mrs
douglas
had
been
standing
listening
at
the
half
opened
door
and
now
she
entered
the
room
you
have
done
enough
for
now
cecil
said
she
whatever
comes
of
it
in
the
future
you
have
done
enough
and
more
than
enough
remarked
sherlock
holmes
gravely
have
every
sympathy
with
you
madam
and
should
strongly
urge
you
to
have
some
confidence
in
the
common
sense
of
our
jurisdiction
and
to
take
the
police
voluntarily
into
your
complete
confidence
it
may
be
that
am
myself
at
fault
for
not
following
up
the
hint
which
you
conveyed
to
me
through
my
friend
dr
watson
but
at
that
time
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
you
were
directly
concerned
in
the
crime
now
am
assured
that
this
is
not
so
at
the
same
time
there
is
much
that
is
unexplained
and
should
strongly
recommend
that
you
ask
mr
douglas
to
tell
us
his
own
story
mrs
douglas
gave
cry
of
astonishment
at
holmes
words
the
detectives
and
must
have
echoed
it
when
we
were
aware
of
man
who
seemed
to
have
emerged
from
the
wall
who
advanced
now
from
the
gloom
of
the
corner
in
which
he
had
appeared
mrs
douglas
turned
and
in
an
instant
her
arms
were
round
him
barker
had
seized
his
outstretched
hand
it
best
this
way
jack
his
wife
repeated
am
sure
that
it
is
best
indeed
yes
mr
douglas
said
sherlock
holmes
am
sure
that
you
will
find
it
best
the
man
stood
blinking
at
us
with
the
dazed
look
of
one
who
comes
from
the
dark
into
the
light
it
was
remarkable
face
bold
grey
eyes
strong
short
clipped
grizzled
moustache
square
projecting
chin
and
humorous
mouth
he
took
good
look
at
us
all
and
then
to
my
amazement
he
advanced
to
me
and
handed
me
bundle
of
paper
ve
heard
of
you
said
he
in
voice
which
was
not
quite
english
and
not
quite
american
but
was
altogether
mellow
and
pleasing
you
are
the
historian
of
this
bunch
well
dr
watson
you
ve
never
had
such
story
as
that
pass
through
your
hands
before
and
ll
lay
my
last
dollar
on
that
tell
it
your
own
way
but
there
are
the
facts
and
you
can
miss
the
public
so
long
as
you
have
those
ve
been
cooped
up
two
days
and
ve
spent
the
daylight
hours
as
much
daylight
as
could
get
in
that
rat
trap
in
putting
the
thing
into
words
you
re
welcome
to
them
you
and
your
public
there
the
story
of
the
valley
of
fear
that
the
past
mr
douglas
said
sherlock
holmes
quietly
what
we
desire
now
is
to
hear
your
story
of
the
present
you
ll
have
it
sir
said
douglas
may
smoke
as
talk
well
thank
you
mr
holmes
you
re
smoker
yourself
if
remember
right
and
you
ll
guess
what
it
is
to
be
sitting
for
two
days
with
tobacco
in
your
pocket
and
afraid
that
the
smell
will
give
you
away
he
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
and
sucked
at
the
cigar
which
holmes
had
handed
him
ve
heard
of
you
mr
holmes
never
guessed
that
should
meet
you
but
before
you
are
through
with
that
he
nodded
at
my
papers
you
will
say
ve
brought
you
something
fresh
inspector
macDonald
had
been
staring
at
the
newcomer
with
the
greatest
amazement
well
this
fairly
beats
me
he
cried
at
last
if
you
are
mr
john
douglas
of
birlstone
manor
then
whose
death
have
we
been
investigating
for
these
two
days
and
where
in
the
world
have
you
sprung
from
now
you
seemed
to
me
to
come
out
of
the
floor
like
jack
in
box
ah
mr
mac
said
holmes
shaking
reproving
forefinger
you
would
not
read
that
excellent
local
compilation
which
described
the
concealment
of
king
charles
people
did
not
hide
in
those
days
without
excellent
hiding
places
and
the
hiding
place
that
has
once
been
used
may
be
again
had
persuaded
myself
that
we
should
find
mr
douglas
under
this
roof
and
how
long
have
you
been
playing
this
trick
upon
us
mr
holmes
said
the
inspector
angrily
how
long
have
you
allowed
us
to
waste
ourselves
upon
search
that
you
knew
to
be
an
absurd
one
not
one
instant
my
dear
mr
mac
only
last
night
did
form
my
views
of
the
case
as
they
could
not
be
put
to
the
proof
until
this
evening
invited
you
and
your
colleague
to
take
holiday
for
the
day
pray
what
more
could
do
when
found
the
suit
of
clothes
in
the
moat
it
at
once
became
apparent
to
me
that
the
body
we
had
found
could
not
have
been
the
body
of
mr
john
douglas
at
all
but
must
be
that
of
the
bicyclist
from
tunbridge
wells
no
other
conclusion
was
possible
therefore
had
to
determine
where
mr
john
douglas
himself
could
be
and
the
balance
of
probability
was
that
with
the
connivance
of
his
wife
and
his
friend
he
was
concealed
in
house
which
had
such
conveniences
for
fugitive
and
awaiting
quieter
times
when
he
could
make
his
final
escape
well
you
figured
it
out
about
right
said
douglas
approvingly
thought
dodge
your
british
law
for
was
not
sure
how
stood
under
it
and
also
saw
my
chance
to
throw
these
hounds
once
for
all
off
my
track
mind
you
from
first
to
last
have
done
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
and
nothing
that
would
not
do
again
but
you
ll
judge
that
for
yourselves
when
tell
you
my
story
never
mind
warning
me
inspector
ready
to
stand
pat
upon
the
truth
not
going
to
begin
at
the
beginning
that
all
there
he
indicated
my
bundle
of
papers
and
mighty
queer
yarn
you
ll
find
it
all
comes
down
to
this
that
there
are
some
men
that
have
good
cause
to
hate
me
and
would
give
their
last
dollar
to
know
that
they
had
got
me
so
long
as
am
alive
and
they
are
alive
there
is
no
safety
in
this
world
for
me
they
hunted
me
from
chicago
to
california
then
they
chased
me
out
of
america
but
when
married
and
settled
down
in
this
quiet
spot
thought
my
last
years
were
going
to
be
peaceable
never
explained
to
my
wife
how
things
were
why
should
pull
her
into
it
she
would
never
have
quiet
moment
again
but
would
always
be
imagining
trouble
fancy
she
knew
something
for
may
have
dropped
word
here
or
word
there
but
until
yesterday
after
you
gentlemen
had
seen
her
she
never
knew
the
rights
of
the
matter
she
told
you
all
she
knew
and
so
did
barker
here
for
on
the
night
when
this
thing
happened
there
was
mighty
little
time
for
explanations
she
knows
everything
now
and
would
have
been
wiser
man
if
had
told
her
sooner
but
it
was
hard
question
dear
he
took
her
hand
for
an
instant
in
his
own
and
acted
for
the

well
gentlemen
the
day
before
these
happenings
was
over
in
tunbridge
wells
and
got
glimpse
of
man
in
the
street
it
was
only
glimpse
but
have
quick
eye
for
these
things
and
never
doubted
who
it
was
it
was
the
worst
enemy
had
among
them
all
one
who
has
been
after
me
like
hungry
wolf
after
caribou
all
these
years
knew
there
was
trouble
coming
and
came
home
and
made
ready
for
it
guessed
fight
through
it
all
right
on
my
own
my
luck
was
proverb
in
the
states
about
76
never
doubted
that
it
would
be
with
me
still
was
on
my
guard
all
that
next
day
and
never
went
out
into
the
park
it
as
well
or
he
have
had
the
drop
on
me
with
that
buckshot
gun
of
his
before
ever
could
draw
on
him
after
the
bridge
was
up
my
mind
was
always
more
restful
when
that
bridge
was
up
in
the
evenings
put
the
thing
clear
out
of
my
head
never
dreamed
of
his
getting
into
the
house
and
waiting
for
me
but
when
made
my
round
in
my
dressing
gown
as
was
my
habit
had
no
sooner
entered
the
study
than
scented
danger
guess
when
man
has
had
dangers
in
his
life
and
ve
had
more
than
most
in
my
time
there
is
kind
of
sixth
sense
that
waves
the
red
flag
saw
the
signal
clear
enough
and
yet
couldn
tell
you
why
next
instant
spotted
boot
under
the
window
curtain
and
then
saw
why
plain
enough
just
the
one
candle
that
was
in
my
hand
but
there
was
good
light
from
the
hall
lamp
through
the
open
door
put
down
the
candle
and
jumped
for
hammer
that
left
on
the
mantel
at
the
same
moment
he
sprang
at
me
saw
the
glint
of
knife
and
lashed
at
him
with
the
hammer
got
him
somewhere
for
the
knife
tinkled
down
on
the
floor
he
dodged
round
the
table
as
quick
as
an
eel
and
moment
later
he
got
his
gun
from
under
his
coat
heard
him
cock
it
but
had
got
hold
of
it
before
he
could
fire
had
it
by
the
barrel
and
we
wrestled
for
it
all
ends
up
for
minute
or
more
it
was
death
to
the
man
that
lost
his
grip
he
never
lost
his
grip
but
he
got
it
butt
downward
for
moment
too
long
maybe
it
was
that
pulled
the
trigger
maybe
we
just
jolted
it
off
between
us
anyhow
he
got
both
barrels
in
the
face
and
there
was
staring
down
at
all
that
was
left
of
ted
baldwin
recognized
him
in
the
township
and
again
when
he
sprang
for
me
but
his
own
mother
wouldn
recognize
him
as
saw
him
then
used
to
rough
work
but
fairly
turned
sick
at
the
sight
of
him
was
hanging
on
the
side
of
the
table
when
barker
came
hurrying
down
heard
my
wife
coming
and
ran
to
the
door
and
stopped
her
it
was
no
sight
for
woman
promised
come
to
her
soon
said
word
or
two
to
barker
he
took
it
all
in
at
glance
and
we
waited
for
the
rest
to
come
along
but
there
was
no
sign
of
them
then
we
understood
that
they
could
hear
nothing
and
that
all
that
had
happened
was
known
only
to
ourselves
it
was
at
that
instant
that
the
idea
came
to
me
was
fairly
dazzled
by
the
brilliance
of
it
the
man
sleeve
had
slipped
up
and
there
was
the
branded
mark
of
the
lodge
upon
his
forearm
see
here
the
man
whom
we
had
known
as
douglas
turned
up
his
own
coat
and
cuff
to
show
brown
triangle
within
circle
exactly
like
that
which
we
had
seen
upon
the
dead
man
it
was
the
sight
of
that
which
started
me
on
it
seemed
to
see
it
all
clear
at
glance
there
were
his
height
and
hair
and
figure
about
the
same
as
my
own
no
one
could
swear
to
his
face
poor
devil
brought
down
this
suit
of
clothes
and
in
quarter
of
an
hour
barker
and
had
put
my
dressing
gown
on
him
and
he
lay
as
you
found
him
we
tied
all
his
things
into
bundle
and
weighted
them
with
the
only
weight
could
find
and
put
them
through
the
window
the
card
he
had
meant
to
lay
upon
my
body
was
lying
beside
his
own
my
rings
were
put
on
his
finger
but
when
it
came
to
the
wedding
ring
he
held
out
his
muscular
hand
you
can
see
for
yourselves
that
had
struck
the
limit
have
not
moved
it
since
the
day
was
married
and
it
would
have
taken
file
to
get
it
off
don
know
anyhow
that
should
have
cared
to
part
with
it
but
if
had
wanted
to
couldn
so
we
just
had
to
leave
that
detail
to
take
care
of
itself
on
the
other
hand
brought
bit
of
plaster
down
and
put
it
where
am
wearing
one
myself
at
this
instant
you
slipped
up
there
mr
holmes
clever
as
you
are
for
if
you
had
chanced
to
take
off
that
plaster
you
would
have
found
no
cut
underneath
it
well
that
was
the
situation
if
could
lie
low
for
while
and
then
get
away
where
could
be
joined
by
my
widow
we
should
have
chance
at
last
of
living
in
peace
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
these
devils
would
give
me
no
rest
so
long
as
was
above
ground
but
if
they
saw
in
the
papers
that
baldwin
had
got
his
man
there
would
be
an
end
of
all
my
troubles
hadn
much
time
to
make
it
all
clear
to
barker
and
to
my
wife
but
they
understood
enough
to
be
able
to
help
me
knew
all
about
this
hiding
place
so
did
ames
but
it
never
entered
his
head
to
connect
it
with
the
matter
retired
into
it
and
it
was
up
to
barker
to
do
the
rest
guess
you
can
fill
in
for
yourselves
what
he
did
he
opened
the
window
and
made
the
mark
on
the
sill
to
give
an
idea
of
how
the
murderer
escaped
it
was
tall
order
that
but
as
the
bridge
was
up
there
was
no
other
way
then
when
everything
was
fixed
he
rang
the
bell
for
all
he
was
worth
what
happened
afterward
you
know
and
so
gentlemen
you
can
do
what
you
please
but
ve
told
you
the
truth
and
the
whole
truth
so
help
me
god
what
ask
you
now
is
how
do
stand
by
the
english
law
there
was
silence
which
was
broken
by
sherlock
holmes
the
english
law
is
in
the
main
just
law
you
will
get
no
worse
than
your
deserts
from
that
mr
douglas
but
would
ask
you
how
did
this
man
know
that
you
lived
here
or
how
to
get
into
your
house
or
where
to
hide
to
get
you
know
nothing
of
this
holmes
face
was
very
white
and
grave
the
story
is
not
over
yet
fear
said
he
you
may
find
worse
dangers
than
the
english
law
or
even
than
your
enemies
from
america
see
trouble
before
you
mr
douglas
you
ll
take
my
advice
and
still
be
on
your
guard
and
now
my
long
suffering
readers
will
ask
you
to
come
away
with
me
for
time
far
from
the
sussex
manor
house
of
birlstone
and
far
also
from
the
year
of
grace
in
which
we
made
our
eventful
journey
which
ended
with
the
strange
story
of
the
man
who
had
been
known
as
john
douglas
wish
you
to
journey
back
some
twenty
years
in
time
and
westward
some
thousands
of
miles
in
space
that
may
lay
before
you
singular
and
terrible
narrative
so
singular
and
so
terrible
that
you
may
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
even
as
tell
it
even
so
did
it
occur
do
not
think
that
intrude
one
story
before
another
is
finished
as
you
read
on
you
will
find
that
this
is
not
so
and
when
have
detailed
those
distant
events
and
you
have
solved
this
mystery
of
the
past
we
shall
meet
once
more
in
those
rooms
on
baker
street
where
this
like
so
many
other
wonderful
happenings
will
find
its
end
part
ii
the
scowrers
the
man
it
was
the
fourth
of
february
in
the
year
1875
it
had
been
severe
winter
and
the
snow
lay
deep
in
the
gorges
of
the
gilmerton
mountains
the
steam
ploughs
had
however
kept
the
railroad
open
and
the
evening
train
which
connects
the
long
line
of
coal
mining
and
iron
working
settlements
was
slowly
groaning
its
way
up
the
steep
gradients
which
lead
from
stagville
on
the
plain
to
vermissa
the
central
township
which
lies
at
the
head
of
vermissa
valley
from
this
point
the
track
sweeps
downward
to
barton
crossing
helmdale
and
the
purely
agricultural
county
of
merton
it
was
single
track
railroad
but
at
every
siding
and
they
were
numerous
long
lines
of
trucks
piled
with
coal
and
iron
ore
told
of
the
hidden
wealth
which
had
brought
rude
population
and
bustling
life
to
this
most
desolate
corner
of
the
united
states
of
america
for
desolate
it
was
little
could
the
first
pioneer
who
had
traversed
it
have
ever
imagined
that
the
fairest
prairies
and
the
most
lush
water
pastures
were
valueless
compared
to
this
gloomy
land
of
black
crag
and
tangled
forest
above
the
dark
and
often
scarcely
penetrable
woods
upon
their
flanks
the
high
bare
crowns
of
the
mountains
white
snow
and
jagged
rock
towered
upon
each
flank
leaving
long
winding
tortuous
valley
in
the
centre
up
this
the
little
train
was
slowly
crawling
the
oil
lamps
had
just
been
lit
in
the
leading
passenger
car
long
bare
carriage
in
which
some
twenty
or
thirty
people
were
seated
the
greater
number
of
these
were
workmen
returning
from
their
day
toil
in
the
lower
part
of
the
valley
at
least
dozen
by
their
grimed
faces
and
the
safety
lanterns
which
they
carried
proclaimed
themselves
miners
these
sat
smoking
in
group
and
conversed
in
low
voices
glancing
occasionally
at
two
men
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
car
whose
uniforms
and
badges
showed
them
to
be
policemen

several
women
of
the
labouring
class
and
one
or
two
travellers
who
might
have
been
small
local
storekeepers
made
up
the
rest
of
the
company
with
the
exception
of
one
young
man
in
corner
by
himself
it
is
with
this
man
that
we
are
concerned
take
good
look
at
him
for
he
is
worth
it
he
is
fresh
complexioned
middle
sized
young
man
not
far
one
would
guess
from
his
thirtieth
year
he
has
large
shrewd
humorous
grey
eyes
which
twinkle
inquiringly
from
time
to
time
as
he
looks
round
through
his
spectacles
at
the
people
about
him
it
is
easy
to
see
that
he
is
of
sociable
and
possibly
simple
disposition
anxious
to
be
friendly
to
all
men
anyone
could
pick
him
at
once
as
gregarious
in
his
habits
and
communicative
in
his
nature
with
quick
wit
and
ready
smile
and
yet
the
man
who
studied
him
more
closely
might
discern
certain
firmness
of
jaw
and
grim
tightness
about
the
lips
which
would
warn
him
that
there
were
depths
beyond
and
that
this
pleasant
brown
haired
young
irishman
might
conceivably
leave
his
mark
for
good
or
evil
upon
any
society
to
which
he
was
introduced
having
made
one
or
two
tentative
remarks
to
the
nearest
miner
and
receiving
only
short
gruff
replies
the
traveller
resigned
himself
to
uncongenial
silence
staring
moodily
out
of
the
window
at
the
fading
landscape
it
was
not
cheering
prospect
through
the
growing
gloom
there
pulsed
the
red
glow
of
the
furnaces
on
the
sides
of
the
hills
great
heaps
of
slag
and
dumps
of
cinders
loomed
up
on
each
side
with
the
high
shafts
of
the
collieries
towering
above
them
huddled
groups
of
mean
wooden
houses
the
windows
of
which
were
beginning
to
outline
themselves
in
light
were
scattered
here
and
there
along
the
line
and
the
frequent
halting
places
were
crowded
with
their
swarthy
inhabitants
the
iron
and
coal
valleys
of
the
vermissa
district
were
no
resorts
for
the
leisured
or
the
cultured
everywhere
there
were
stern
signs
of
the
crudest
battle
of
life
the
rude
work
to
be
done
and
the
rude
strong
workers
who
did
it
the
young
traveller
gazed
out
into
this
dismal
country
with
face
of
mingled
repulsion
and
interest
which
showed
that
the
scene
was
new
to
him
at
intervals
he
drew
from
his
pocket
bulky
letter
to
which
he
referred
and
on
the
margins
of
which
he
scribbled
some
notes
once
from
the
back
of
his
waist
he
produced
something
which
one
would
hardly
have
expected
to
find
in
the
possession
of
so
mild
mannered
man
it
was
navy
revolver
of
the
largest
size
as
he
turned
it
slantwise
to
the
light
the
glint
upon
the
rims
of
the
copper
shells
within
the
drum
showed
that
it
was
fully
loaded
he
quickly
restored
it
to
his
secret
pocket
but
not
before
it
had
been
observed
by
working
man
who
had
seated
himself
upon
the
adjoining
bench
hullo
mate
said
he
you
seem
heeled
and
ready
the
young
man
smiled
with
an
air
of
embarrassment
yes
said
he
we
need
them
sometimes
in
the
place
come
from
and
where
may
that
be
last
from
chicago
stranger
in
these
parts
yes
you
may
find
you
need
it
here
said
the
workman
ah
is
that
so
the
young
man
seemed
interested
have
you
heard
nothing
of
doings
hereabouts
nothing
out
of
the
way
why
thought
the
country
was
full
of
it
you
ll
hear
quick
enough
what
made
you
come
here
heard
there
was
always
work
for
willing
man
are
you
one
of
the
labour
union
sure
then
you
ll
get
your
job
guess
have
you
any
friends
not
yet
but
have
the
means
of
making
them
how
that
then
am
one
of
the
ancient
order
of
freemen
there
no
town
without
lodge
and
where
there
is
lodge
ll
find
my
friends
the
remark
had
singular
effect
upon
his
companion
he
glanced
round
suspiciously
at
the
others
in
the
car
the
miners
were
still
whispering
among
themselves
the
two
police
officers
were
dozing
he
came
across
seated
himself
close
to
the
young
traveller
and
held
out
his
hand
put
it
there
he
said
hand
grip
passed
between
the
two
see
you
speak
the
truth
said
the
workman
but
it
well
to
make
certain
he
raised
his
right
hand
to
his
right
eyebrow
the
traveller
at
once
raised
his
left
hand
to
his
left
eyebrow
dark
nights
are
unpleasant
said
the
workman
yes
for
strangers
to
travel
the
other
answered
that
good
enough
brother
scanlan

chicago
bodymaster

but
am
in
luck
to
meet
brother
so
early
well
there
are
plenty
of
us
about
you
won
find
the
order
more
flourishing
anywhere
in
the
states
than
right
here
in
vermissa
valley
but
we
could
do
with
some
lads
like
you
can
understand
spry
man
of
the
union
finding
no
work
to
do
in
chicago
found
plenty
of
work
to
do
said
mcMurdo
then
why
did
you
leave
mcMurdo
nodded
towards
the
policemen
and
smiled
guess
those
chaps
would
be
glad
to
know
he
said
scanlan
groaned
sympathetically
in
trouble
he
asked
in
whisper
deep
penitentiary
job
and
the
rest
not
killing
it
early
days
to
talk
of
such
things
said
mcMurdo
with
the
air
of
man
who
had
been
surprised
into
saying
more
than
he
intended
ve
my
own
good
reasons
for
leaving
chicago
and
let
that
be
enough
for
you
who
are
you
that
you
should
take
it
on
yourself
to
ask
such
things
his
grey
eyes
gleamed
with
sudden
and
dangerous
anger
from
behind
his
glasses
all
right
mate
no
offense
meant
the
boys
will
think
none
the
worse
of
you
whatever
you
may
have
done
where
are
you
bound
for
now
vermissa
that
the
third
halt
down
the
line
where
are
you
staying
mcMurdo
took
out
an
envelope
and
held
it
close
to
the
murky
oil
lamp
here
is
the
address
jacob
shafter
sheridan
street
it
boarding
house
that
was
recommended
by
man
knew
in
chicago
well
don
know
it
but
vermissa
is
out
of
my
beat
live
at
hobson
patch
and
that
here
where
we
are
drawing
up
but
say
there
one
bit
of
advice
ll
give
you
before
we
part
if
you
re
in
trouble
in
vermissa
go
straight
to
the
union
house
and
see
boss
mcGinty
he
is
the
bodymaster
of
vermissa
lodge
and
nothing
can
happen
in
these
parts
unless
black
jack
mcGinty
wants
it
so
long
mate
maybe
we
ll
meet
in
lodge
one
of
these
evenings
but
mind
my
words
if
you
are
in
trouble
go
to
boss
mcGinty
scanlan
descended
and
mcMurdo
was
left
once
again
to
his
thoughts
night
had
now
fallen
and
the
flames
of
the
frequent
furnaces
were
roaring
and
leaping
in
the
darkness
against
their
lurid
background
dark
figures
were
bending
and
straining
twisting
and
turning
with
the
motion
of
winch
or
of
windlass
to
the
rhythm
of
an
eternal
clank
and
roar
guess
hell
must
look
something
like
that
said
voice
mcMurdo
turned
and
saw
that
one
of
the
policemen
had
shifted
in
his
seat
and
was
staring
out
into
the
fiery
waste
for
that
matter
said
the
other
policeman
allow
that
hell
must
be
something
like
that
if
there
are
worse
devils
down
yonder
than
some
we
could
name
it
more
than
expect
guess
you
are
new
to
this
part
young
man
well
what
if
am
mcMurdo
answered
in
surly
voice
just
this
mister
that
should
advise
you
to
be
careful
in
choosing
your
friends
don
think
begin
with
mike
scanlan
or
his
gang
if
were
you
what
the
hell
is
it
to
you
who
are
my
friends
roared
mcMurdo
in
voice
which
brought
every
head
in
the
carriage
round
to
witness
the
altercation
did
ask
you
for
your
advice
or
did
you
think
me
such
sucker
that
couldn
move
without
it
you
speak
when
you
are
spoken
to
and
by
the
lord
you
have
to
wait
long
time
if
it
was
me
he
thrust
out
his
face
and
grinned
at
the
patrolmen
like
snarling
dog
the
two
policemen
heavy
good
natured
men
were
taken
aback
by
the
extraordinary
vehemence
with
which
their
friendly
advances
had
been
rejected
no
offense
stranger
said
one
it
was
warning
for
your
own
good
seeing
that
you
are
by
your
own
showing
new
to
the
place
new
to
the
place
but
not
new
to
you
and
your
kind
cried
mcMurdo
in
cold
fury
guess
you
re
the
same
in
all
places
shoving
your
advice
in
when
nobody
asks
for
it
maybe
we
ll
see
more
of
you
before
very
long
said
one
of
the
patrolmen
with
grin
you
re
real
hand
picked
one
if
am
judge
was
thinking
the
same
remarked
the
other
guess
we
may
meet
again
not
afraid
of
you
and
don
you
think
it
cried
mcMurdo
my
name
jack
mcMurdo
see
if
you
want
me
you
ll
find
me
at
jacob
shafter
on
sheridan
street
vermissa
so
not
hiding
from
you
am
day
or
night
dare
to
look
the
like
of
you
in
the
face
don
make
any
mistake
about

there
was
murmur
of
sympathy
and
admiration
from
the
miners
at
the
dauntless
demeanour
of
the
newcomer
while
the
two
policemen
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
renewed
conversation
between
themselves
few
minutes
later
the
train
ran
into
the
ill
lit
station
and
there
was
general
clearing
for
vermissa
was
by
far
the
largest
town
on
the
line
mcMurdo
picked
up
his
leather
gripsack
and
was
about
to
start
off
into
the
darkness
when
one
of
the
miners
accosted
him
by
gar
mate
you
know
how
to
speak
to
the
cops
he
said
in
voice
of
awe
it
was
grand
to
hear
you
let
me
carry
your
grip
and
show
you
the
road
passing
shafter
on
the
way
to
my
own
shack
there
was
chorus
of
friendly
good
nights
from
the
other
miners
as
they
passed
from
the
platform
before
ever
he
had
set
foot
in
it
mcMurdo
the
turbulent
had
become
character
in
vermissa
the
country
had
been
place
of
terror
but
the
town
was
in
its
way
even
more
depressing
down
that
long
valley
there
was
at
least
certain
gloomy
grandeur
in
the
huge
fires
and
the
clouds
of
drifting
smoke
while
the
strength
and
industry
of
man
found
fitting
monuments
in
the
hills
which
he
had
spilled
by
the
side
of
his
monstrous
excavations
but
the
town
showed
dead
level
of
mean
ugliness
and
squalor
the
broad
street
was
churned
up
by
the
traffic
into
horrible
rutted
paste
of
muddy
snow
the
sidewalks
were
narrow
and
uneven
the
numerous
gas
lamps
served
only
to
show
more
clearly
long
line
of
wooden
houses
each
with
its
veranda
facing
the
street
unkempt
and
dirty
as
they
approached
the
centre
of
the
town
the
scene
was
brightened
by
row
of
well
lit
stores
and
even
more
by
cluster
of
saloons
and
gaming
houses
in
which
the
miners
spent
their
hard
earned
but
generous
wages
that
the
union
house
said
the
guide
pointing
to
one
saloon
which
rose
almost
to
the
dignity
of
being
hotel
jack
mcGinty
is
the
boss
there
what
sort
of
man
is
he
mcMurdo
asked
what
have
you
never
heard
of
the
boss
how
could
have
heard
of
him
when
you
know
that
am
stranger
in
these
parts
well
thought
his
name
was
known
clear
across
the
country
it
been
in
the
papers
often
enough
what
for
well
the
miner
lowered
his
voice
over
the
affairs
what
affairs
good
lord
mister
you
are
queer
if
must
say
it
without
offense
there
only
one
set
of
affairs
that
you
ll
hear
of
in
these
parts
and
that
the
affairs
of
the
scowrers
why
seem
to
have
read
of
the
scowrers
in
chicago
gang
of
murderers
are
they
not
hush
on
your
life
cried
the
miner
standing
still
in
alarm
and
gazing
in
amazement
at
his
companion
man
you
won
live
long
in
these
parts
if
you
speak
in
the
open
street
like
that
many
man
has
had
the
life
beaten
out
of
him
for
less
well
know
nothing
about
them
it
only
what
have
read
and
not
saying
that
you
have
not
read
the
truth
the
man
looked
nervously
round
him
as
he
spoke
peering
into
the
shadows
as
if
he
feared
to
see
some
lurking
danger
if
killing
is
murder
then
god
knows
there
is
murder
and
to
spare
but
don
you
dare
to
breathe
the
name
of
jack
mcGinty
in
connection
with
it
stranger
for
every
whisper
goes
back
to
him
and
he
is
not
one
that
is
likely
to
let
it
pass
now
that
the
house
you
re
after
that
one
standing
back
from
the
street
you
ll
find
old
jacob
shafter
that
runs
it
as
honest
man
as
lives
in
this
township
thank
you
said
mcMurdo
and
shaking
hands
with
his
new
acquaintance
he
plodded
gripsack
in
hand
up
the
path
which
led
to
the
dwelling
house
at
the
door
of
which
he
gave
resounding
knock
it
was
opened
at
once
by
someone
very
different
from
what
he
had
expected
it
was
woman
young
and
singularly
beautiful
she
was
of
the
german
type
blonde
and
fair
haired
with
the
piquant
contrast
of
pair
of
beautiful
dark
eyes
with
which
she
surveyed
the
stranger
with
surprise
and
pleasing
embarrassment
which
brought
wave
of
colour
over
her
pale
face
framed
in
the
bright
light
of
the
open
doorway
it
seemed
to
mcMurdo
that
he
had
never
seen
more
beautiful
picture
the
more
attractive
for
its
contrast
with
the
sordid
and
gloomy
surroundings
lovely
violet
growing
upon
one
of
those
black
slag
heaps
of
the
mines
would
not
have
seemed
more
surprising
so
entranced
was
he
that
he
stood
staring
without
word
and
it
was
she
who
broke
the
silence
thought
it
was
father
said
she
with
pleasing
little
touch
of
german
accent
did
you
come
to
see
him
he
is
downtown
expect
him
back
every
minute
mcMurdo
continued
to
gaze
at
her
in
open
admiration
until
her
eyes
dropped
in
confusion
before
this
masterful
visitor
no
miss
he
said
at
last
in
no
hurry
to
see
him
but
your
house
was
recommended
to
me
for
board
thought
it
might
suit
me
and
now
know
it
will
you
are
quick
to
make
up
your
mind
said
she
with
smile
anyone
but
blind
man
could
do
as
much
the
other
answered
she
laughed
at
the
compliment
come
right
in
sir
she
said
miss
ettie
shafter
mr
shafter
daughter
my
mother
dead
and
run
the
house
you
can
sit
down
by
the
stove
in
the
front
room
until
father
comes
along
ah
here
he
is
so
you
can
fix
things
with
him
right
away
heavy
elderly
man
came
plodding
up
the
path
in
few
words
mcMurdo
explained
his
business
man
of
the
name
of
murphy
had
given
him
the
address
in
chicago
he
in
turn
had
it
from
someone
else
old
shafter
was
quite
ready
the
stranger
made
no
bones
about
terms
agreed
at
once
to
every
condition
and
was
apparently
fairly
flush
of
money
for
seven
dollars
week
paid
in
advance
he
was
to
have
board
and
lodging
so
it
was
that
mcMurdo
the
self
confessed
fugitive
from
justice
took
up
his
abode
under
the
roof
of
the
shafters
the
first
step
which
was
to
lead
to
so
long
and
dark
train
of
events
ending
in
far
distant
land
ii
the
bodymaster
mcMurdo
was
man
who
made
his
mark
quickly
wherever
he
was
the
folk
around
soon
knew
it
within
week
he
had
become
infinitely
the
most
important
person
at
shafter
there
were
ten
or
dozen
boarders
there
but
they
were
honest
foremen
or
commonplace
clerks
from
the
stores
of
very
different
calibre
from
the
young
irishman
of
an
evening
when
they
gathered
together
his
joke
was
always
the
readiest
his
conversation
the
brightest
and
his
song
the
best
he
was
born
boon
companion
with
magnetism
which
drew
good
humour
from
all
around
him
and
yet
he
showed
again
and
again
as
he
had
shown
in
the
railway
carriage
capacity
for
sudden
fierce
anger
which
compelled
the
respect
and
even
the
fear
of
those
who
met
him
for
the
law
too
and
all
who
were
connected
with
it
he
exhibited
bitter
contempt
which
delighted
some
and
alarmed
others
of
his
fellow
boarders
from
the
first
he
made
it
evident
by
his
open
admiration
that
the
daughter
of
the
house
had
won
his
heart
from
the
instant
that
he
had
set
eyes
upon
her
beauty
and
her
grace
he
was
no
backward
suitor
on
the
second
day
he
told
her
that
he
loved
her
and
from
then
onward
he
repeated
the
same
story
with
an
absolute
disregard
of
what
she
might
say
to
discourage
him
someone
else
he
would
cry
well
the
worse
luck
for
someone
else
let
him
look
out
for
himself
am
to
lose
my
life
chance
and
all
my
heart
desire
for
someone
else
you
can
keep
on
saying
no
ettie
the
day
will
come
when
you
will
say
yes
and
young
enough
to
wait
he
was
dangerous
suitor
with
his
glib
irish
tongue
and
his
pretty
coaxing
ways
there
was
about
him
also
that
glamour
of
experience
and
of
mystery
which
attracts
woman
interest
and
finally
her
love
he
could
talk
of
the
sweet
valleys
of
county
monaghan
from
which
he
came
of
the
lovely
distant
island
the
low
hills
and
green
meadows
of
which
seemed
the
more
beautiful
when
imagination
viewed
them
from
this
place
of
grime
and
snow
then
he
was
versed
in
the
life
of
the
cities
of
the
north
of
detroit
and
the
lumber
camps
of
michigan
and
finally
of
chicago
where
he
had
worked
in
planing
mill
and
afterwards
came
the
hint
of
romance
the
feeling
that
strange
things
had
happened
to
him
in
that
great
city
so
strange
and
so
intimate
that
they
might
not
be
spoken
of
he
spoke
wistfully
of
sudden
leaving
breaking
of
old
ties
flight
into
strange
world
ending
in
this
dreary
valley
and
ettie
listened
her
dark
eyes
gleaming
with
pity
and
with
sympathy
those
two
qualities
which
may
turn
so
rapidly
and
so
naturally
to
love
mcMurdo
had
obtained
temporary
job
as
bookkeeper
for
he
was
well
educated
man
this
kept
him
out
most
of
the
day
and
he
had
not
found
occasion
yet
to
report
himself
to
the
head
of
the
lodge
of
theAncient
order
of
freemen
he
was
reminded
of
his
omission
however
by
visit
one
evening
from
mike
scanlan
the
fellow
member
whom
he
had
met
in
the
train
scanlan
the
small
sharp
faced
nervous
black
eyed
man
seemed
glad
to
see
him
once
more
after
glass
or
two
of
whisky
he
broached
the
object
of
his
visit

so
pressing
as
all
that
maybe
not
in
chicago
well
it
the
same
society
here

at

long
and
fixedly
there

in
his
eyes

friend
advice
and
go
at
once
it
chanced
that
on
the
same
evening
mcMurdo
had
another
more
pressing
interview
which
urged
him
in
the
same
direction
it
may
have
been
that
his
attentions
to
ettie
had
been
more
evident
than
before
or
that
they
had
gradually
obtruded
themselves
into
the
slow
mind
of
his
good
german
host
but
whatever
the
cause
the
boarding
house
keeper
beckoned
the
young
man
into
his
private
room
and
started
on
the
subject
without
any
circumlocution
it
seems
to
me
mister

mcMurdo

mcMurdo
found
himself
under
sentence
of
banishment
both
from
his
comfortable
quarters
and
from
the
girl
whom
he
loved
he
found
her
alone
in
the
sitting
room
that
same
evening
and
he
poured
his
troubles
into
her
ear
sure
your
father
is

said

the
girl
sank
her
face
into
her
hands
wish
to
heaven
that

had
been
first
she
sobbed
mcMurdo
was
down
on
his
knees
before
her
in
an
instant
for
god
sake
ettie
let
it
stand
at
that
he
cried
will
you
ruin
your
life
and
my
own
for
the
sake
of
this
promise
follow
your
heart
acushla
tis
safer
guide
than
any
promise
before
you
knew
what
it
was
that
you
were
saying
he
had
seized
ettie
white
hand
between
his
own
strong
brown
ones
say
that
you
will
be
mine
and
we
will
face
it
out
together
not
here
yes
here
no
jack
his
arms
were
round
her
now
it
could
not
be
here
could
you
take
me
away
struggle
passed
for
moment
over
mcMurdo
face
but
it
ended
by
setting
like
granite
no
here
he
said
ll
hold
you
against
the
world
ettie
right
here
where
we
are
why
should
we
not
leave
together
no
ettie
can
leave
here
but
why
never
hold
my
head
up
again
if
felt
that
had
been
driven
out
besides
what
is
there
to
be
afraid
of

country
if

and
you
who

them
said
mcMurdo
ve
lived
among
rough
men
my
darling
and
instead
of
fearing
them
it
has
always
ended
that
they
have
feared
me
always
ettie
it
mad
on
the
face
of
it
if
these
men
as
your
father
says
have
done
crime
after
crime
in
the
valley
and
if
everyone
knows
them
by
name
how
comes
it
that
none
are
brought
to
justice
you
answer
me
that
ettie
because
no
witness
dares
to
appear
against
them
he
would
not
live
month
if
he
did
also
because
they
have
always
their
own
men
to
swear
that
the
accused
one
was
far
from
the
scene
of
the
crime
but
surely
jack
you
must
have
read
all
this
had
understood
that
every
paper
in
the
united
states
was
writing
about
it
well
have
read
something
it
is
true
but
had
thought
it
was
story
maybe
these
men
have
some
reason
in
what
they
do
maybe
they
are
wronged
and
have
no
other
way
to
help
themselves
oh
jack
don
let
me
hear
you
speak
so
that
is
how
he
speaks
the
other
one
baldwin
he
speaks
like
that
does
he
and
that
is
why
loathe
him
so
oh
jack
now
can
tell
you
the
truth
loathe
him
with
all
my
heart
but
fear
him
also
fear
him
for
myself
but
above
all
fear
him
for
father
know
that
some
great
sorrow
would
come
upon
us
if
dared
to
say
what
really
felt
that
is
why
have
put
him
off
with
half
promises
it
was
in
real
truth
our
only
hope
but
if
you
would
fly
with
me
jack
we
could
take
father
with
us
and
live
forever
far
from
the
power
of
these
wicked
men
again
there
was
the
struggle
upon
mcMurdo
face
and
again
it
set
like
granite
no
harm
shall
come
to
you
ettie
nor
to
your
father
either
as
to
wicked
men
expect
you
may
find
that
am
as
bad
as
the
worst
of
them
before
we
re
through
no
jack
would
trust
you
anywhere
mcMurdo
laughed
bitterly
good
lord
how
little
you
know
of
me
your
innocent
soul
my
darling
could
not
even
guess
what
is
passing
in
mine
but

the
door
had
opened
suddenly
and
young
fellow
came
swaggering
in
with
the
air
of
one
who
is
the
master
he
was
handsome
dashing
young
man
of
about
the
same
age
and
build
as
mcMurdo
himself
under
his
broad
brimmed
black
felt
hat
which
he
had
not
troubled
to
remove
handsome
face
with
fierce
domineering
eyes
and
curved
hawk
bill
of
nose
looked
savagely
at
the
pair
who
sat
by
the
stove
ettie
had
jumped
to
her
feet
full
of
confusion
and
alarm
glad
to

she

mcMurdo

mcMurdo
quietly
or
maybe
mr
baldwin
you
will
take
turn
down
the
street
with
me
it
fine
evening
and
there
some
open
ground
beyond
the
next
block

without

my
hands

his
enemy

wish

house
before

no
time
like
the
present
cried
mcMurdo
ll
choose
my
own
time
mister
you
can
leave
the
time
to
me
see
here
he
suddenly
rolled
up
his
sleeve
and
showed
upon
his
forearm
peculiar
sign
which
appeared
to
have
been
branded
there
it
was
circle
with
triangle
within
it
you
know
what
that
means
neither
know
nor
care
well
you
will
know
ll
promise
you

to
you
ettie
you

come
back
to

on
your
knees

tell
you
what
your
punishment
may
be
you
ve
sowed
and
by
the
lord
ll
see
that
you
reap
he
glanced
at
them
both
in
fury
then
he
turned
upon
his
heel
and
an
instant
later
the
outer
door
had
banged
behind
him
for
few
moments
mcMurdo
and
the
girl
stood
in
silence
then
she
threw
her
arms
around
him
oh
jack
how
brave
you
were
but
it
is
no
use
you
must
fly
to
night
jack
to
night
it
your
only
hope
he
will
have
your
life
read
it
in
his
horrible
eyes
what
chance
have
you
against
dozen
of
them
with
boss
mcGinty
and
all
the
power
of
the
lodge
behind
them
mcMurdo
disengaged
her
hands
kissed
her
and
gently
pushed
her
back
into
chair
there
acushla
there
don
be
disturbed
or
fear
for
me
freeman
myself
after
telling
your
father
about
it
maybe
am
no
better
than
the
others
so
don
make
saint
of
me
perhaps
you
hate
me
too
now
that
ve
told
you
as
much
hate
you
jack
while
life
lasts
could
never
do
that
ve
heard
that
there
is
no
harm
in
being
freeman
anywhere
but
here
so
why
should
think
the
worse
of
you
for
that
but
if
you
are
freeman
jack
why
should
you
not
go
down
and
make
friend
of
boss
mcGinty
oh
hurry
jack
hurry
get
your
word
in
first
or
the
hounds
will
be
on
your
trail
was
thinking
the
same
thing
said
mcMurdo
ll
go
right
now
and
fix
it
you
can
tell
your
father
that
ll
sleep
here
to
night
and
find
some
other
quarters
in
the
morning
the
bar
of
mcGinty
saloon
was
crowded
as
usual
for
it
was
the
favourite
loafing
place
of
all
the
rougher
elements
of
the
town
the
man
was
popular
for
he
had
rough
jovial
disposition
which
formed
mask
covering
great
deal
which
lay
behind
it
but
apart
from
this
popularity
the
fear
in
which
he
was
held
throughout
the
township
and
indeed
down
the
whole
thirty
miles
of
the
valley
and
past
the
mountains
on
each
side
of
it
was
enough
in
itself
to
fill
his
bar
for
none
could
afford
to
neglect
his
good
will
besides
those
secret
powers
which
it
was
universally
believed
that
he
exercised
in
so
pitiless
fashion
he
was
high
public
official
municipal
councillor
and
commissioner
of
roads
elected
to
the
office
through
the
votes
of
the
ruffians
who
in
turn
expected
to
receive
favours
at
his
hands
assessments
and
taxes
were
enormous
the
public
works
were
notoriously
neglected
the
accounts
were
slurred
over
by
bribed
auditors
and
the
decent
citizen
was
terrorized
into
paying
public
blackmail
and
holding
his
tongue
lest
some
worse
thing
befall
him
thus
it
was
that
year
by
year
boss
mcGinty
diamond
pins
became
more
obtrusive
his
gold
chains
more
weighty
across
more
gorgeous
vest
and
his
saloon
stretched
farther
and
farther
until
it
threatened
to
absorb
one
whole
side
of
the
market
square
mcMurdo
pushed
open
the
swinging
door
of
the
saloon
and
made
his
way
amid
the
crowd
of
men
within
through
an
atmosphere
blurred
with
tobacco
smoke
and
heavy
with
the
smell
of
spirits
the
place
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
the
huge
heavily
gilt
mirrors
upon
every
wall
reflected
and
multiplied
the
garish
illumination
there
were
several
bartenders
in
their
shirt
sleeves
hard
at
work
mixing
drinks
for
the
loungers
who
fringed
the
broad
brass
trimmed
counter
at
the
far
end
with
his
body
resting
upon
the
bar
and
cigar
stuck
at
an
acute
angle
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
stood
tall
strong
heavily
built
man
who
could
be
none
other
than
the
famous
mcGinty
himself
he
was
black
maned
giant
bearded
to
the
cheek
bones
and
with
shock
of
raven
hair
which
fell
to
his
collar
his
complexion
was
as
swarthy
as
that
of
an
italian
and
his
eyes
were
of
strange
dead
black
which
combined
with
slight
squint
gave
them
particularly
sinister
appearance
all
else
in
the
man
his
noble
proportions
his
fine
features
and
his
frank
bearing
fitted
in
with
that
jovial
man
to
man
manner
which
he
affected
here
one
would
say
is
bluff
honest
fellow
whose
heart
would
be
sound
however
rude
his
outspoken
words
might
seem
it
was
only
when
those
dead
dark
eyes
deep
and
remorseless
were
turned
upon
man
that
he
shrank
within
himself
feeling
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
an
infinite
possibility
of
latent
evil
with
strength
and
courage
and
cunning
behind
it
which
made
it
thousand
times
more
deadly
having
had
good
look
at
his
man
mcMurdo
elbowed
his
way
forward
with
his
usual
careless
audacity
and
pushed
himself
through
the
little
group
of
courtiers
who
were
fawning
upon
the
powerful
boss
laughing
uproariously
at
the
smallest
of
his
jokes
the
young
stranger
bold
grey
eyes
looked
back
fearlessly
through
their
glasses
at
the
deadly
black
ones
which
turned
sharply
upon
him
well
young
man
can
call
your
face
to
mind
new
here
mr
mcGinty
you
are
not
so
new
that
you
can
give
gentleman
his
proper
title
he
councillor
mcGinty
young
man
said
voice
from
the
group
sorry
councillor
strange
to
the
ways
of
the
place
but
was
advised
to
see
you
well
you
see
me
this
is
all
there
is
what
you
think
of
me
well
it
early
days
if
your
heart
is
as
big
as
your
body
and
your
soul
as
fine
as
your
face
then
ask
for
nothing
better
said
mcMurdo
by
gosh
you
ve
got
an
irish
tongue
in
your
head
anyhow
cried
the
saloon
keeper
not
quite
certain
whether
to
humour
this
audacious
visitor
or
to
stand
upon
his
dignity
so
you
are
good
enough
to
pass
my
appearance
sure
said
mcMurdo
and
you
were
told
to
see
me
was
and
who
told
you
brother
scanlan
of
lodge
341
vermissa
drink
your
health
councillor
and
to
our
better
acquaintance
he
raised
glass
with
which
he
had
been
served
to
his
lips
and
elevated
his
little
finger
as
he
drank
it
mcGinty
who
had
been
watching
him
narrowly
raised
his
thick
black
eyebrows
oh
it
like
that
is
it
said
he
ll
have
to
look
bit
closer
into
this
mister
mcMurdo
bit
closer
mr
mcMurdo
for
we
don
take
folk
on
trust
in
these
parts
nor
believe
all
we
re
told
neither
come
in
here
for
moment
behind
the
bar
there
was
small
room
there
lined
with
barrels
mcGinty
carefully
closed
the
door
and
then
seated
himself
on
one
of
them
biting
thoughtfully
on
his
cigar
and
surveying
his
companion
with
those
disquieting
eyes
for
couple
of
minutes
he
sat
in
complete
silence
mcMurdo
bore
the
inspection
cheerfully
one
hand
in
his
coat
pocket
the
other
twisting
his
brown
moustache
suddenly
mcGinty
stooped
and
produced
wicked
looking
revolver

see
here
my
joker
said
he
if
thought
you
were
playing
any
game
on
us
it
would
be
short
work
for
you
this
is
strange
welcome
mcMurdo
answered
with
some
dignity
for
the
bodymaster
of
lodge
of
freemen
to
give
to
stranger
brother
ay
but
it
just
that
same
that
you
have
to
prove
said
mcGinty
and
god
help
you
if
you
fail
where
were
you
made
lodge
29
chicago
when
june
24
1872
what
bodymaster
james
scott
who
is
your
district
ruler
bartholomew
wilson
hum
you
seem
glib
enough
in
your
tests
what
are
you
doing
here
working
the
same
as
you
but
poorer
job
you
have
your
back
answer
quick
enough
yes
was
always
quick
of
speech
are
you
quick
of
action
have
had
that
name
among
those
that
knew
me
best
well
we
may
try
you
sooner
than
you
think
have
you
heard
anything
of
the
lodge
in
these
parts
ve
heard
that
it
takes
man
to
be
brother
true
for
you
mr
mcMurdo
why
did
you
leave
chicago
damned
if
tell
you
that
mcGinty
opened
his
eyes
he
was
not
used
to
being
answered
in
such
fashion
and
it
amused
him
why
won
you
tell
me
because
no
brother
may
tell
another
lie
then
the
truth
is
too
bad
to
tell
you
can
put
it
that
way
if
you
like
see
here
mister
you
can
expect
me
as
bodymaster
to
pass
into
the
lodge
man
for
whose
past
he
can
answer
mcMurdo
looked
puzzled
then
he
took
worn
newspaper
cutting
from
an
inner
pocket
you
wouldn
squeal
on
fellow
said
he
ll
wipe
my
hand
across
your
face
if
you
say
such
words
to
me
cried
mcGinty
hotly
you
are
right
councillor
said
mcMurdo
meekly
should
apologize
spoke
without
thought
well
know
that
am
safe
in
your
hands
look
at
that
clipping
mcGinty
glanced
his
eyes
over
the
account
of
the
shooting
of
one
jonas
pinto
in
the
lake
saloon
market
street
chicago
in
the
new
year
week
of
1874
your
work
he
asked
as
he
handed
back
the
paper
mcMurdo
nodded
why
did
you
shoot
him
was
helping
uncle
sam
to
make
dollars
maybe
mine
were
not
as
good
gold
as
his
but
they
looked
as
well
and
were
cheaper
to
make
this
man
pinto
helped
me
to
shove
the
queer
to
do
what
well
it
means
to
pass
the
dollars
out
into
circulation
then
he
said
he
would
split
maybe
he
did
split
didn
wait
to
see
just
killed
him
and
lighted
out
for
the
coal
country
why
the
coal
country
cause
read
in
the
papers
that
they
weren
too
particular
in
those
parts
mcGinty
laughed
you
were
first
coiner
and
then
murderer
and
you
came
to
these
parts
because
you
thought
you
be
welcome
that
about
the
size
of
it
mcMurdo
answered
well
guess
you
ll
go
far
say
can
you
make
those
dollars
yet
mcMurdo
took
half
dozen
from
his
pocket
those
never
passed
the
washington
mint
said
he
you
don
say
mcGinty
held
them
to
the
light
in
his
enormous
hand
which
was
hairy
as
gorilla
can
see
no
difference
gar
you
ll
be
mighty
useful
brother
thinking
we
can
do
with
bad
man
or
two
among
us
friend
mcMurdo
for
there
are
times
when
we
have
to
take
our
own
part
we
soon
be
against
the
wall
if
we
didn
shove
back
at
those
that
were
pushing
us
well
guess
ll
do
my
share
of
shoving
with
the
rest
of
the
boys
you
seem
to
have
good
nerve
you
didn
flinch
when
put
this
pistol
on
you
it
was
not
me
that
was
in
danger
who
then
it
was
you
councillor
mcMurdo
drew
cocked
pistol
from
the
side
pocket
of
his
peajacket
was
covering
you
all
the
time
guess
my
shot
would
have
been
as
quick
as
yours
by
gar
mcGinty
flushed
an
angry
red
and
then
burst
into
roar
of
laughter
say
we
ve
had
no
such
holy
terror
come
to
hand
this
many
year
reckon
the
lodge
will
learn
to
be
proud
of
you…
well
what
the
hell
do
you
want
and
can
speak
alone
with
gentleman
for
five
minutes
but
you
must
butt
in
on
us
the
bar
tender
stood
abashed
sorry
councillor
but
it
ted
baldwin
he
says
he
must
see
you
this
very
minute
the
message
was
unnecessary
for
the
set
cruel
face
of
the
man
himself
was
looking
over
the
servant
shoulder
he
pushed
the
bartender
out
and
closed
the
door
on
him
so
said
he
with
furious
glance
at
mcMurdo
you
got
here
first
did
you
ve
word
to
say
to
you
councillor
about
this
man
then
say
it
here
and
now
before
my
face
cried
mcMurdo
ll
say
it
at
my
own
time
in
my
own
way
tut
said
mcGinty
getting
off
his
barrel
this
will
never
do
we
have
new
brother
here
baldwin
and
it
not
for
us
to
greet
him
in
such
fashion
hold
out
your
hand
man
and
make
it
up
never
cried
baldwin
in
fury
ve
offered
to
fight
him
if
he
thinks
have
wronged
him
said
mcMurdo
ll
fight
him
with
fists
or
if
that
won
satisfy
him
ll
fight
him
any
other
way
he
chooses
now
ll
leave
it
to
you
councillor
to
judge
between
us
as
bodymaster
should
what
is
it
then
young
lady
she
free
to
choose
for
herself
is
she
cried
baldwin
as
between
two
brothers
of
the
lodge
should
say
that
she
was
said
the
boss
oh
that
your
ruling
is
it
yes
it
is
ted
baldwin
said
mcGinty
with
wicked
stare
is
it
you
that
would
dispute
it
you
would
throw
over
one
that
has
stood
by
you
this
five
years
in
favour
of
man
that
you
never
saw
before
in
your
life
you
re
not
bodymaster
for
life
jack
mcGinty
and
by
god
when
next
it
comes
to
vote
the
councillor
sprang
at
him
like
tiger
his
hand
closed
round
the
other
neck
and
he
hurled
him
back
across
one
of
the
barrels
in
his
mad
fury
he
would
have
squeezed
the
life
out
of
him
if
mcMurdo
had
not
interfered
easy
councillor
for
heaven
sake
go
easy
he
cried
as
he
dragged
him
back
mcGinty
released
his
hold
and
baldwin
cowed
and
shaken
gasping
for
breath
and
shivering
in
every
limb
as
one
who
has
looked
over
the
very
edge
of
death
sat
up
on
the
barrel
over
which
he
had
been
hurled
you
ve
been
asking
for
it
this
many
day
ted
baldwin
now
you
ve
got
it
cried
mcGinty
his
huge
chest
rising
and
falling
maybe
you
think
if
was
voted
down
from
bodymaster
you
would
find
yourself
in
my
shoes
it
for
the
lodge
to
say
that
but
so
long
as
am
the
chief
ll
have
no
man
lift
his
voice
against
me
or
my
rulings
have
nothing
against
you
mumbled
baldwin
feeling
his
throat
well
then
cried
the
other
relapsing
in
moment
into
bluff
joviality
we
are
all
good
friends
again
and
there
an
end
of
the
matter
he
took
bottle
of
champagne
down
from
the
shelf
and
twisted
out
the
cork
see
now
he
continued
as
he
filled
three
high
glasses
let
us
drink
the
quarrelling
toast
of
the
lodge
after
that
as
you
know
there
can
be
no
bad
blood
between
us
now
then
the
left
hand
on
the
apple
of
my
throat
say
to
you
ted
baldwin
what
is
the
offense
sir
the
clouds
are
heavy
answered
baldwin
but
they
will
forever
brighten
and
this
swear
the
men
drank
their
glasses
and
the
same
ceremony
was
performed
between
baldwin
and
mcMurdo
there
cried
mcGinty
rubbing
his
hands
that
the
end
of
the
black
blood
you
come
under
lodge
discipline
if
it
goes
further
and
that
heavy
hand
in
these
parts
as
brother
baldwin
knows
and
as
you
will
damn
soon
find
out
brother
mcMurdo
if
you
ask
for
trouble
faith
be
slow
to
do
that
said
mcMurdo
he
held
out
his
hand
to
baldwin
quick
to
quarrel
and
quick
to
forgive
it
my
hot
irish
blood
they
tell
me
but
it
over
for
me
and
bear
no
grudge
baldwin
had
to
take
the
proffered
hand
for
the
baleful
eye
of
the
terrible
boss
was
upon
him
but
his
sullen
face
showed
how
little
the
words
of
the
other
had
moved
him
mcGinty
clapped
them
both
on
the
shoulders
tut
these
girls
these
girls
he
cried
to
think
that
the
same
petticoats
should
come
between
two
of
my
boys
it
the
devil
own
luck
well
it
the
colleen
inside
of
them
that
must
settle
the
question
for
it
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
bodymaster
and
the
lord
be
praised
for
that
we
have
enough
on
us
without
the
women
as
well
you
ll
have
to
be
affiliated
to
lodge
341
brother
mcMurdo
we
have
our
own
ways
and
methods
different
from
chicago
saturday
night
is
our
meeting
and
if
you
come
then
we
ll
make
you
free
forever
of
the
vermissa
valley
iii
lodge
341
vermissa
on
the
day
following
the
evening
which
had
contained
so
many
exciting
events
mcMurdo
moved
his
lodgings
from
old
jacob
shafter
and
took
up
his
quarters
at
the
widow
macNamara
on
the
extreme
outskirts
of
the
town
scanlan
his
original
acquaintance
aboard
the
train
had
occasion
shortly
afterwards
to
move
into
vermissa
and
the
two
lodged
together
there
was
no
other
boarder
and
the
hostess
was
an
easy
going
old
irishwoman
who
left
them
to
themselves
so
that
they
had
freedom
for
speech
and
action
welcome
to
men
who
had
secrets
in

shafter
had
relented
to
the
extent
of
letting
mcMurdo
come
to
his
meals
there
when
he
liked
so
that
his
intercourse
with
ettie
was
by
no
means
broken
on
the
contrary
it
drew
closer
and
more
intimate
as
the
weeks
went
by
in
his
bedroom
at
his
new
abode
mcMurdo
felt
it
safe
to
take
out
the
coining
moulds
and
under
many
pledge
of
secrecy
number
of
brothers
from
the
lodge
were
allowed
to
come
in
and
see
them
each
carrying
away
in
his
pocket
some
examples
of
the
false
money
so
cunningly
struck
that
there
was
never
the
slightest
difficulty
or
danger
in
passing
it
why
with
such
wonderful
art
at
his
command
mcMurdo
should
condescend
to
work
at
all
was
perpetual
mystery
to
his
companions
though
he
made
it
clear
to
anyone
who
asked
him
that
if
he
lived
without
any
visible
means
it
would
very
quickly
bring
the
police
upon
his
track
one
policeman
was
indeed
after
him
already
but
the
incident
as
luck
would
have
it
did
the
adventurer
great
deal
more
good
than
harm
after
the
first
introduction
there
were
few
evenings
when
he
did
not
find
his
way
to
mcGinty
saloon
there
to
make
closer
acquaintance
with
the
boys
which
was
the
jovial
title
by
which
the
dangerous
gang
who
infested
the
place
were
known
to
one
another
his
dashing
manner
and
fearlessness
of
speech
made
him
favourite
with
them
all
while
the
rapid
and
scientific
way
in
which
he
polished
off
his
antagonist
in
an
all
in
bar
room
scrap
earned
the
respect
of
that
rough
community
another
incident
however
raised
him
even
higher
in
their
estimation
just
at
the
crowded
hour
one
night
the
door
opened
and
man
entered
with
the
quiet
blue
uniform
and
peaked
cap
of
the
coal
and
iron
police
this
was
special
body
raised
by
the
railways
and
colliery
owners
to
supplement
the
efforts
of
the
ordinary
civil
police
who
were
perfectly
helpless
in
the
face
of
the
organized
ruffianism
which
terrorized
the
district
there
was
hush
as
he
entered
and
many
curious
glance
was
cast
at
him
but
the
relations
between
policemen
and
criminals
are
peculiar
in
some
parts
of
the
states
and
mcGinty
himself
standing
behind
his
counter
showed
no
surprise
when
the
policeman
enrolled
himself
among
his
customers
straight
whisky
for
the
night
is
bitter
said
the
police
officer
don
think
we
have
met
before
councillor
you
ll
be
the
new
captain
said
mcGinty
that
so
we
re
looking
to
you
councillor
and
to
the
other
leading
citizens
to
help
us
in
upholding
law
and
order
in
this
township
captain
marvin
is
my
name
of
the
coal
and
iron
we
do
better
without
you
captain
marvin
said
mcGinty
coldly
for
we
have
our
own
police
of
the
township
and
no
need
for
any
imported
goods
what
are
you
but
the
paid
tool
of
the
capitalists
hired
by
them
to
club
or
shoot
your
poorer
fellow
citizen
well
we
won
argue
about
that
said
the
police
officer
good
humouredly
expect
we
all
do
our
duty
same
as
we
see
it
but
we
can
all
see
it
the
same
he
had
drunk
off
his
glass
and
had
turned
to
go
when
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
face
of
jack
mcMurdo
who
was
scowling
at
his
elbow
hullo
he
cried
looking
him
up
and
down
here
an
old
acquaintance
mcMurdo
shrank
away
from
him
was
never
friend
to
you
nor
any
other
cursed
copper
in
my
life
said
he
an
acquaintance
isn
always
friend
said
the
police
captain
grinning
you
re
jack
mcMurdo
of
chicago
right
enough
and
don
you
deny
it
mcMurdo
shrugged
his
shoulders
not
denying
it
said
he
ye
think
ashamed
of
my
own
name
you
ve
got
good
cause
to
be
anyhow
what
the
devil
you
mean
by
that
he
roared
with
his
fists
clenched
no
jack
bluster
won
do
with
me
was
an
officer
in
chicago
before
ever
came
to
this
darned
coal
bunker
and
know
chicago
crook
when
see
one
mcMurdo
face
fell
don
tell
me
that
you
re
marvin
of
the
chicago
central
he
cried
just
the
same
old
teddy
marvin
at
your
service
we
haven
forgotten
the
shooting
of
jonas
pinto
up
there
never
shot
him
did
you
not
that
good
impartial
evidence
ain
it
well
his
death
came
in
uncommon
handy
for
you
or
they
would
have
had
you
for
shoving
the
queer
well
we
can
let
that
be
bygones
for
between
you
and
me
and
perhaps
going
further
than
my
duty
in
saying
it
they
could
get
no
clear
case
against
you
and
chicago
open
to
you
to
morrow
very
well
where
am
well
ve
given
you
the
pointer
and
you
re
sulky
dog
not
to
thank
me
for
it
well
suppose
you
mean
well
and
do
thank
you
said
mcMurdo
in
no
very
gracious
manner
it
mum
with
me
so
long
as
see
you
living
on
the
straight
said
the
captain
but
by
the
lord
if
you
get
off
after
this
it
another
story
so
good
night
to
you
and
goodnight
councillor
he
left
the
bar
room
but
not
before
he
had
created
local
hero
mcMurdo
deeds
in
far
chicago
had
been
whispered
before
he
had
put
off
all
questions
with
smile
as
one
who
did
not
wish
to
have
greatness
thrust
upon
him
but
now
the
thing
was
officially
confirmed
the
bar
loafers
crowded
round
him
and
shook
him
heartily
by
the
hand
he
was
free
of
the
community
from
that
time
on
he
could
drink
hard
and
show
little
trace
of
it
but
that
evening
had
his
mate
scanlan
not
been
at
hand
to
lead
him
home
the
feted
hero
would
surely
have
spent
his
night
under
the
bar
on
saturday
night
mcMurdo
was
introduced
to
the
lodge
he
had
thought
to
pass
in
without
ceremony
as
being
an
initiate
of
chicago
but
there
were
particular
rites
in
vermissa
of
which
they
were
proud
and
these
had
to
be
undergone
by
every
postulant
the
assembly
met
in
large
room
reserved
for
such
purposes
at
the
union
house
some
sixty
members
assembled
at
vermissa
but
that
by
no
means
represented
the
full
strength
of
the
organization
for
there
were
several
other
lodges
in
the
valley
and
others
across
the
mountains
on
each
side
who
exchanged
members
when
any
serious
business
was
afoot
so
that
crime
might
be
done
by
men
who
were
strangers
to
the
locality
altogether
there
were
not
less
than
five
hundred
scattered
over
the
coal
district
in
the
bare
assembly
room
the
men
were
gathered
round
long
table
at
the
side
was
second
one
laden
with
bottles
and
glasses
on
which
some
members
of
the
company
were
already
turning
their
eyes
mcGinty
sat
at
the
head
with
flat
black
velvet
cap
upon
his
shock
of
tangled
black
hair
and
coloured
purple
stole
round
his
neck
so
that
he
seemed
to
be
priest
presiding
over
some
diabolical
ritual
to
right
and
left
of
him
were
the
higher
lodge
officials
the
cruel
handsome
face
of
ted
baldwin
among
them
each
of
these
wore
some
scarf
or
medallion
as
emblem
of
his
office
they
were
for
the
most
part
men
of
mature
age
but
the
rest
of
the
company
consisted
of
young
fellows
from
eighteen
to
twenty
five
the
ready
and
capable
agents
who
carried
out
the
commands
of
their
seniors
among
the
older
men
were
many
whose
features
showed
the
tigerish
lawless
souls
within
but
looking
at
the
rank
and
file
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
these
eager
and
open
faced
young
fellows
were
in
very
truth
dangerous
gang
of
murderers
whose
minds
had
suffered
such
complete
moral
perversion
that
they
took
horrible
pride
in
their
proficiency
at
the
business
and
looked
with
deepest
respect
at
the
man
who
had
the
reputation
of
making
what
they
called
clean
job
to
their
contorted
natures
it
had
become
spirited
and
chivalrous
thing
to
volunteer
for
service
against
some
man
who
had
never
injured
them
and
whom
in
many
cases
they
had
never
seen
in
their
lives
the
crime
committed
they
quarrelled
as
to
who
had
actually
struck
the
fatal
blow
and
amused
one
another
and
the
company
by
describing
the
cries
and
contortions
of
the
murdered
man
at
first
they
had
shown
some
secrecy
in
their
arrangements
but
at
the
time
which
this
narrative
describes
their
proceedings
were
extraordinarily
open
for
the
repeated
failures
of
the
law
had
proved
to
them
that
on
the
one
hand
no
one
would
dare
to
witness
against
them
and
on
the
other
they
had
an
unlimited
number
of
stanch
witnesses
upon
whom
they
could
call
and
well
filled
treasure
chest
from
which
they
could
draw
the
funds
to
engage
the
best
legal
talent
in
the
state
in
ten
long
years
of
outrage
there
had
been
no
single
conviction
and
the
only
danger
that
ever
threatened
the
scowrers
lay
in
the
victim
himself
who
however
outnumbered
and
taken
by
surprise
might
and
occasionally
did
leave
his
mark
upon
his
assailants
mcMurdo
had
been
warned
that
some
ordeal
lay
before
him
but
no
one
would
tell
him
in
what
it
consisted
he
was
led
now
into
an
outer
room
by
two
solemn
brothers
through
the
plank
partition
he
could
hear
the
murmur
of
many
voices
from
the
assembly
within
once
or
twice
he
caught
the
sound
of
his
own
name
and
he
knew
that
they
were
discussing
his
candidacy
then
there
entered
an
inner
guard
with
green
and
gold
sash
across
his
chest

the
bodymaster
orders
that
he
shall
be
trussed
blinded
and
entered
said
he
the
three
of
them
removed
his
coat
turned
up
the
sleeve
of
his
right
arm
and
finally
passed
rope
round
above
the
elbows
and
made
it
fast
they
next
placed
thick
black
cap
right
over
his
head
and
the
upper
part
of
his
face
so
that
he
could
see
nothing
he
was
then
led
into
the
assembly
hall
it
was
pitch
dark
and
very
oppressive
under
his
hood
he
heard
the
rustle
and
murmur
of
the
people
round
him
and
then
the
voice
of
mcGinty
sounded
dull
and
distant
through
the
covering
of
his
ears
john
mcMurdo
said
the
voice
are
you
already
member
of
the
ancient
order
of
freemen
he
bowed
in
assent
is
your
lodge
no

chicago
he
bowed
again
dark
nights
are
unpleasant
said
the
voice
yes
for
strangers
to
travel
he
answered
the
clouds
are
heavy
yes
storm
is
approaching
are
the
brethren
satisfied
asked
the
bodymaster
there
was
general
murmur
of
assent
we
know
brother
by
your
sign
and
by
your
countersign
that
you
are
indeed
one
of
us
said
mcGinty
we
would
have
you
know
however
that
in
this
county
and
in
other
counties
of
these
parts
we
have
certain
rites
and
also
certain
duties
of
our
own
which
call
for
good
men
are
you
ready
to
be
tested
am
are
you
of
stout
heart
am
take
stride
forward
to
prove
it
as
the
words
were
said
he
felt
two
hard
points
in
front
of
his
eyes
pressing
upon
them
so
that
it
appeared
as
if
he
could
not
move
forward
without
danger
of
losing
them
none
the
less
he
nerved
himself
to
step
resolutely
out
and
as
he
did
so
the
pressure
melted
away
there
was
low
murmur
of
applause
he
is
of
stout
heart
said
the
voice
can
you
bear
pain
as
well
as
another
he
answered
test
him
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
keep
himself
from
screaming
out
for
an
agonizing
pain
shot
through
his
forearm
he
nearly
fainted
at
the
sudden
shock
of
it
but
he
bit
his
lip
and
clenched
his
hands
to
hide
his
agony
can
take
more
than
that
said
he
this
time
there
was
loud
applause
finer
first
appearance
had
never
been
made
in
the
lodge
hands
clapped
him
on
the
back
and
the
hood
was
plucked
from
his
head
he
stood
blinking
and
smiling
amid
the
congratulations
of
the
brothers
one
last
word
brother
mcMurdo
said
mcGinty
you
have
already
sworn
the
oath
of
secrecy
and
fidelity
and
you
are
aware
that
the
punishment
for
any
breach
of
it
is
instant
and
inevitable
death
am
said
mcMurdo
and
you
accept
the
rule
of
the
bodymaster
for
the
time
being
under
all
circumstances
do
then
in
the
name
of
lodge
341
vermissa
welcome
you
to
its
privileges
and
debates
you
will
put
the
liquor
on
the
table
brother
scanlan
and
we
will
drink
to
our
worthy
brother
mcMurdo
coat
had
been
brought
to
him
but
before
putting
it
on
he
examined
his
right
arm
which
still
smarted
heavily
there
on
the
flesh
of
the
forearm
was
circle
with
triangle
within
it
deep
and
red
as
the
branding
iron
had
left
it
one
or
two
of
his
neighbours
pulled
up
their
sleeves
and
showed
their
own
lodge
marks
we
ve
all
had
it
said
one
but
not
all
as
brave
as
you
over
it
tut
it
was
nothing
said
he
but
it
burned
and
ached
all
the
same
when
the
drinks
which
followed
the
ceremony
of
initiation
had
all
been
disposed
of
the
business
of
the
lodge
proceeded
mcMurdo
accustomed
only
to
the
prosaic
performances
of
chicago
listened
with
open
ears
and
more
surprise
than
he
ventured
to
show
to
what
followed
the
first
business
on
the
agenda
paper
said
mcGinty
is
to
read
the
following
letter
from
division
master
windle
of
merton
county
lodge
249
he
says
dear
sir
there
is
job
to
be
done
on
andrew
rae
of
rae
sturmash
coal
owners
near
this
place
you
will
remember
that
your
lodge
owes
us
return
having
had
the
service
of
two
brethren
in
the
matter
of
the
patrolman
last
fall
you
will
send
two
good
men
they
will
be
taken
charge
of
by
treasurer
higgins
of
this
lodge
whose
address
you
know
he
will
show
them
when
to
act
and
where
yours
in
freedom
windle
has
never
refused
us
when
we
have
had
occasion
to
ask
for
the
loan
of
man
or
two
and
it
is
not
for
us
to
refuse
him
mcGinty
paused
and
looked
round
the
room
with
his
dull
malevolent
eyes
who
will
volunteer
for
the
job
several
young
fellows
held
up
their
hands
the
bodymaster
looked
at
them
with
an
approving
smile
you
ll
do
tiger
cormac
if
you
handle
it
as
well
as
you
did
the
last
you
won
be
wrong
and
you
wilson
ve
no
pistol
said
the
volunteer
mere
boy
in
his
teens
it
your
first
is
it
not
well
you
have
to
be
blooded
some
time
it
will
be
great
start
for
you
as
to
the
pistol
you
ll
find
it
waiting
for
you
or
mistaken
if
you
report
yourselves
on
monday
it
will
be
time
enough
you
ll
get
great
welcome
when
you
return
any
reward
this
time
asked
cormac
thick
set
darkfaced
brutal
looking
young
man
whose
ferocity
had
earned
him
the
nickname
of
tiger
never
mind
the
reward
you
just
do
it
for
the
honour
of
the
thing
maybe
when
it
is
done
there
will
be
few
odd
dollars
at
the
bottom
of
the
box
what
has
the
man
done
asked
young
wilson
sure
it
not
for
the
likes
of
you
to
ask
what
the
man
has
done
he
has
been
judged
over
there
that
no
business
of
ours
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
carry
it
out
for
them
same
as
they
would
for
us
speaking
of
that
two
brothers
from
the
merton
lodge
are
coming
over
to
us
next
week
to
do
some
business
in
this
quarter
who
are
they
asked
someone
faith
it
is
wiser
not
to
ask
if
you
know
nothing
you
can
testify
nothing
and
no
trouble
can
come
of
it
but
they
are
men
who
will
make
clean
job
when
they
are
about
it
and
time
too
cried
ted
baldwin
folk
are
gettin
out
of
hand
in
these
parts
it
was
only
last
week
that
three
of
our
men
were
turned
off
by
foreman
blaker
it
been
owing
him
long
time
and
he
ll
get
it
full
and
proper
get
what
mcMurdo
whispered
to
his
neighbour
the
business
end
of
buckshot
cartridge
cried
the
man
with
loud
laugh
what
think
you
of
our
ways
brother
mcMurdo
criminal
soul
seemed
to
have
already
absorbed
the
spirit
of
the
vile
association
of
which
he
was
now
member
like
it
well
said
he
tis
proper
place
for
lad
of
mettle
several
of
those
who
sat
around
heard
his
words
and
applauded
them
what
that
cried
the
black
maned
bodymaster
from
the
end
of
the
table
tis
our
new
brother
sir
who
finds
our
ways
to
his
taste
mcMurdo
rose
to
his
feet
for
an
instant
would
say
eminent
bodymaster
that
if
man
should
be
wanted
should
take
it
as
an
honour
to
be
chosen
to
help
the
lodge
there
was
great
applause
at
this
it
was
felt
that
new
sun
was
pushing
its
rim
above
the
horizon
to
some
of
the
elders
it
seemed
that
the
progress
was
little
too
rapid
would
move
said
the
secretary
harraway
vulture
faced
old
greybeard
who
sat
near
the
chairman
that
brother
mcMurdo
should
wait
until
it
is
the
good
pleasure
of
the
lodge
to
employ
him
sure
that
was
what
meant
in
your
hands
said
mcMurdo
your
time
will
come
brother
said
the
chairman
we
have
marked
you
down
as
willing
man
and
we
believe
that
you
will
do
good
work
in
these
parts
there
is
small
matter
to
night
in
which
you
may
take
hand
if
it
so
please
you
will
wait
for
something
that
is
worth
while
you
can
come
to
night
anyhow
and
it
will
help
you
to
know
what
we
stand
for
in
this
community
will
make
the
announcement
later
meanwhile
he
glanced
at
his
agenda
paper
have
one
or
two
more
points
to
bring
before
the
meeting
first
of
all
will
ask
the
treasurer
as
to
our
bank
balance
there
is
the
pension
to
jim
carnaway
widow
he
was
struck
down
doing
the
work
of
the
lodge
and
it
is
for
us
to
see
that
she
is
not
the
loser
jim
was
shot
last
month
when
they
tried
to
kill
chester
wilcox
of
marley
creek
mcMurdo
neighbour
informed
him
the
funds
are
good
at
the
moment
said
the
treasurer
with
the
bankbook
in
front
of
him
the
firms
have
been
generous
of
late
max
linder
co
paid
five
hundred
to
be
left
alone
walker
brothers
sent
in
hundred
but
took
it
on
myself
to
return
it
and
ask
for
five
if
do
not
hear
by
wednesday
their
winding
gear
may
get
out
of
order
we
had
to
burn
their
breaker
last
year
before
they
became
reasonable
then
the
west
section
coaling
company
has
paid
its
annual
contribution
we
have
enough
on
hand
to
meet
any
obligations
what
about
archie
swindon
asked
brother
he
has
sold
out
and
left
the
district
the
old
devil
left
note
for
us
to
say
that
he
had
rather
be
free
crossing
sweeper
in
new
york
than
large
mine
owner
under
the
power
of
ring
of
blackmailers
by
gar
it
was
as
well
that
he
made
break
for
it
before
the
note
reached
us
guess
he
won
show
his
face
in
this
valley
again

an
elderly
clean
shaved
man
with
kindly
face
and
good
brow
rose
from
the
end
of
the
table
which
faced
the
chairman
mr
treasurer
he
asked
may
ask
who
has
bought
the
property
of
this
man
that
we
have
driven
out
of
the
district
yes
brother
morris
it
has
been
bought
by
the
state
merton
county
railroad
company
and
who
bought
the
mines
of
todman
and
of
lee
that
came
into
the
market
in
the
same
way
last
year
the
same
company
brother
morris
and
who
bought
the
ironworks
of
manson
and
of
shuman
and
of
van
deher
and
of
atwood
which
have
all
been
given
up
of
late
they
were
all
bought
by
the
west
gilmerton
general
mining
company
don
see
brother
morris
said
the
chairman
that
it
matters
to
us
who
buys
them
since
they
can
carry
them
out
of
the
district
with
all
respect
to
you
eminent
bodymaster
think
it
may
matter
very
much
to
us
this
process
has
been
going
on
now
for
ten
long
years
we
are
gradually
driving
all
the
small
men
out
of
trade
what
is
the
result
we
find
in
their
places
great
companies
like
the
railroad
or
the
general
iron
who
have
their
directors
in
new
york
or
philadelphia
and
care
nothing
for
our
threats
we
can
take
it
out
of
their
local
bosses
but
it
only
means
that
others
will
be
sent
in
their
stead
and
we
are
making
it
dangerous
for
ourselves
the
small
men
could
not
harm
us
they
had
not
the
money
nor
the
power
so
long
as
we
did
not
squeeze
them
too
dry
they
would
stay
on
under
our
power
but
if
these
big
companies
find
that
we
stand
between
them
and
their
profits
they
will
spare
no
pains
and
no
expense
to
hunt
us
down
and
bring
us
to
court
there
was
hush
at
these
ominous
words
and
every
face
darkened
as
gloomy
looks
were
exchanged
so
omnipotent
and
unchallenged
had
they
been
that
the
very
thought
that
there
was
possible
retribution
in
the
background
had
been
banished
from
their
minds
and
yet
the
idea
struck
chill
to
the
most
reckless
of
them
it
is
my
advice
the
speaker
continued
that
we
go
easier
upon
the
small
men
on
the
day
that
they
have
all
been
driven
out
the
power
of
this
society
will
have
been
broken
unwelcome
truths
are
not
popular
there
were
angry
cries
as
the
speaker
resumed
his
seat
mcGinty
rose
with
gloom
upon
his
brow
brother
morris
said
he
you
were
always
croaker
so
long
as
the
members
of
this
lodge
stand
together
there
is
no
power
in
the
united
states
that
can
touch
them
sure
have
we
not
tried
it
often
enough
in
the
law
courts
expect
the
big
companies
will
find
it
easier
to
pay
than
to
fight
same
as
the
little
companies
do
and
now
brethren
mcGinty
took
off
his
black
velvet
cap
and
his
stole
as
he
spoke—
this
lodge
has
finished
its
business
for
the
evening
save
for
one
small
matter
which
may
be
mentioned
when
we
are
parting
the
time
has
now
come
for
fraternal
refreshment
and
for
harmony
strange
indeed
is
human
nature
here
were
these
men
to
whom
murder
was
familiar
who
again
and
again
had
struck
down
the
father
of
the
family
some
man
against
whom
they
had
no
personal
feeling
without
one
thought
of
compunction
or
of
compassion
for
his
weeping
wife
or
helpless
children
and
yet
the
tender
or
pathetic
in
music
could
move
them
to
tears
mcMurdo
had
fine
tenor
voice
and
if
he
had
failed
to
gain
the
good
will
of
the
lodge
before
it
could
no
longer
have
been
withheld
after
he
had
thrilled
them
with
sitting
on
the
stile
mary
and
on
the
banks
of
allan
water
in
his
very
first
night
the
new
recruit
had
made
himself
one
of
the
most
popular
of
the
brethren
marked
already
for
advancement
and
high
office
there
were
other
qualities
needed
however
besides
those
of
good
fellowship
to
make
worthy
freeman
and
of
these
he
was
given
an
example
before
the
evening
was
over
the
whisky
bottle
had
passed
round
many
times
and
the
men
were
flushed
and
ripe
for
mischief
when
their
bodymaster
rose
once
more
to
address
them
boys
said
he
there
one
man
in
this
town
that
wants
trimming
up
and
it
for
you
to
see
that
he
gets
it
speaking
of
james
stanger
of
the
herald
you
ve
seen
how
he
been
opening
his
mouth
against
us
again
there
was
murmur
of
assent
with
many
muttered
oath
mcGinty
took
slip
of
paper
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
law
and
order
that
how
he
heads
it
reign
of
terror
in
the
coal
and
iron
district
twelve
years
have
now
elapsed
since
the
first
assassinations
which
proved
the
existence
of
criminal
organization
in
our
midst
from
that
day
these
outrages
have
never
ceased
until
now
they
have
reached
pitch
which
makes
us
the
opprobrium
of
the
civilized
world
is
it
for
such
results
as
this
that
our
great
country
welcomes
to
its
bosom
the
alien
who
flies
from
the
despotisms
of
europe
is
it
that
they
shall
themselves
become
tyrants
over
the
very
men
who
have
given
them
shelter
and
that
state
of
terrorism
and
lawlessness
should
be
established
under
the
very
shadow
of
the
sacred
folds
of
the
starry
flag
of
freedom
which
would
raise
horror
in
our
minds
if
we
read
of
it
as
existing
under
the
most
effete
monarchy
of
the
east
the
men
are
known
the
organization
is
patent
and
public
how
long
are
we
to
endure
it
can
we
forever
live
sure
ve
read
enough
of
the
slush
cried
the
chairman
tossing
the
paper
down
upon
the
table
that
what
he
says
of
us
the
question
asking
you
is
what
shall
we
say
to
him
kill
him
cried
dozen
fierce
voices
protest
against
that
said
brother
morris
the
man
of
the
good
brow
and
shaved
face
tell
you
brethren
that
our
hand
is
too
heavy
in
this
valley
and
that
there
will
come
point
where
in
self
defense
every
man
will
unite
to
crush
us
out
james
stanger
is
an
old
man
he
is
respected
in
the
township
and
the
district
his
paper
stands
for
all
that
is
solid
in
the
valley
if
that
man
is
struck
down
there
will
be
stir
through
this
state
that
will
only
end
with
our
destruction
and
how
would
they
bring
about
our
destruction
mr
standback
cried
mcGinty
is
it
by
the
police
sure
half
of
them
are
in
our
pay
and
half
of
them
afraid
of
us
or
is
it
by
the
law
courts
and
the
judge
haven
we
tried
that
before
now
and
what
ever
came
of
it
there
is
judge
lynch
that
might
try
the
case
said
brother
morris
general
shout
of
anger
greeted
the
suggestion
have
but
to
raise
my
finger
cried
mcGinty
and
could
put
two
hundred
men
into
this
town
that
would
clear
it
out
from
end
to
end
then
suddenly
raising
his
voice
and
bending
his
huge
black
brows
into
terrible
frown
see
here
brother
morris
have
my
eye
on
you
and
have
had
for
some
time
you
ve
no
heart
yourself
and
you
try
to
take
the
heart
out
of
others
it
will
be
an
ill
day
for
you
brother
morris
when
your
own
name
comes
on
our
agenda
paper
and
thinking
that
it
just
there
that
ought
to
place
it
morris
had
turned
deadly
pale
and
his
knees
seemed
to
give
way
under
him
as
he
fell
back
into
his
chair
he
raised
his
glass
in
his
trembling
hand
and
drank
before
he
could
answer
apologize
worshipful
master
to
you
and
to
every
brother
in
this
lodge
if
have
said
more
than
should
am
faithful
member
you
all
know
that
and
it
is
my
fear
lest
evil
come
to
the
lodge
which
makes
me
speak
in
anxious
words
but
have
greater
trust
in
your
judgment
than
in
my
own
worshipful
master
and
promise
you
that
will
not
offend
again
the
bodymaster
scowl
relaxed
as
he
listened
to
the
humble
words
very
good
brother
morris
it
myself
that
would
be
sorry
if
it
were
needful
to
give
you
lesson
but
so
long
as
am
in
this
chair
we
shall
be
united
lodge
in
word
and
in
deed
and
now
boys
he
continued
looking
round
at
the
company
ll
say
this
much
that
if
stanger
got
his
full
deserts
there
would
be
more
trouble
than
we
need
ask
for
these
editors
hang
together
and
every
journal
in
the
state
would
be
crying
out
for
police
and
troops
but
guess
you
can
give
him
pretty
severe
warning
will
you
fix
it
brother
baldwin
sure
said
the
young
man
eagerly
how
many
will
you
take
half
dozen
and
two
to
guard
the
door
you
ll
come
gower
and
you
mansel
and
you
scanlan
and
the
two
willabys
promised
the
new
brother
he
should
go
said
the
chairman
ted
baldwin
looked
at
mcMurdo
with
eyes
which
showed
that
he
had
not
forgotten
nor
forgiven
well
he
can
come
if
he
wants
he
said
in
surly
voice
that
enough
the
sooner
we
get
to
work
the
better
the
company
broke
up
with
shouts
and
yells
and
snatches
of
drunken
song
the
bar
was
still
crowded
with
revellers
and
many
of
the
brethren
remained
there
the
little
band
who
had
been
told
off
for
duty
passed
out
into
the
street
proceeding
in
twos
and
threes
along
the
sidewalk
so
as
not
to
provoke
attention
it
was
bitterly
cold
night
with
half
moon
shining
brilliantly
in
frosty
star
spangled
sky
the
men
stopped
and
gathered
in
yard
which
faced
high
building
the
words
vermissa
herald
were
printed
in
gold
lettering
between
the
brightly
lit
windows
from
within
came
the
clanking
of
the
printing
press

here
you
said
baldwin
to
mcMurdo
you
can
stand
below
at
the
door
and
see
that
the
road
is
kept
open
for
us
arthur
willaby
can
stay
with
you
others
come
with
me
have
no
fears
boys
for
we
have
dozen
witnesses
that
we
are
in
the
union
bar
at
this
very
moment
it
was
nearly
midnight
and
the
street
was
deserted
save
for
one
or
two
revellers
upon
their
way
home
the
party
crossed
the
road
and
pushing
open
the
door
of
the
newspaper
office
baldwin
and
his
men
rushed
in
and
up
the
stair
which
faced
them
mcMurdo
and
another
remained
below
from
the
room
above
came
shout
cry
for
help
and
then
the
sound
of
trampling
feet
and
of
falling
chairs
an
instant
later
grey
haired
man
rushed
out
on
the
landing
he
was
seized
before
he
could
get
farther
and
his
spectacles
came
tinkling
down
to
mcMurdo
feet
there
was
thud
and
groan
he
was
on
his
face
and
half
dozen
sticks
were
clattering
together
as
they
fell
upon
him
he
writhed
and
his
long
thin
limbs
quivered
under
the
blows
the
others
ceased
at
last
but
baldwin
his
cruel
face
set
in
an
infernal
smile
was
hacking
at
the
man
head
which
he
vainly
endeavoured
to
defend
with
his
arms
his
white
hair
was
dabbled
with
patches
of
blood
baldwin
was
still
stooping
over
his
victim
putting
in
short
vicious
blow
whenever
he
could
see
part
exposed
when
mcMurdo
dashed
up
the
stair
and
pushed
him
back
you
ll
kill
the
man
said
he
drop
it
baldwin
looked
at
him
in
amazement
curse
you
he
cried
who
are
you
to
interfere
you
that
are
new
to
the
lodge
stand
back
he
raised
his
stick
but
mcMurdo
had
whipped
his
pistol
out
of
his
hip
pocket
stand
back
yourself
he
cried
ll
blow
your
face
in
if
you
lay
hand
on
me
as
to
the
lodge
wasn
it
the
order
of
the
bodymaster
that
the
man
was
not
to
be
killed
and
what
are
you
doing
but
killing
him
it
truth
he
says
remarked
one
of
the
men
by
gar
you
best
hurry
yourselves
cried
the
man
below
the
windows
are
all
lighting
up
and
you
ll
have
the
whole
town
here
inside
of
five
minutes
there
was
indeed
the
sound
of
shouting
in
the
street
and
little
group
of
compositors
and
typesetters
was
forming
in
the
hall
below
and
nerving
itself
to
action
leaving
the
limp
and
motionless
body
of
the
editor
at
the
head
of
the
stair
the
criminals
rushed
down
and
made
their
way
swiftly
along
the
street
having
reached
the
union
house
some
of
them
mixed
with
the
crowd
in
mcGinty
saloon
whispering
across
the
bar
to
the
boss
that
the
job
had
been
well
carried
through
others
and
among
them
mcMurdo
broke
away
into
side
streets
and
so
by
devious
paths
to
their
own
homes
iv
the
valley
of
fear
when
mcMurdo
awoke
next
morning
he
had
good
reason
to
remember
his
initiation
into
the
lodge
his
head
ached
with
the
effect
of
the
drink
and
his
arm
where
he
had
been
branded
was
hot
and
swollen
having
his
own
peculiar
source
of
income
he
was
irregular
in
his
attendance
at
his
work
so
he
had
late
breakfast
and
remained
at
home
for
the
morning
writing
long
letter
to
friend
afterwards
he
read
the
daily
herald
in
special
column
put
in
at
the
last
moment
he
read
outrage
at
the
herald
office
editor
seriously
injured
it
was
short
account
of
the
facts
with
which
he
was
himself
more
familiar
than
the
writer
could
have
been
it
ended
with
the
statement
the
matter
is
now
in
the
hands
of
the
police
but
it
can
hardly
be
hoped
that
their
exertions
will
be
attended
by
any
better
results
than
in
the
past
some
of
the
men
were
recognized
and
there
is
hope
that
conviction
may
be
obtained
the
source
of
the
outrage
was
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
infamous
society
which
has
held
this
community
in
bondage
for
so
long
period
and
against
which
the
herald
has
taken
so
uncompromising
stand
mr
stanger
many
friends
will
rejoice
to
hear
that
though
he
has
been
cruelly
and
brutally
beaten
and
though
he
has
sustained
severe
injuries
about
the
head
there
is
no
immediate
danger
to
his
life
below
it
stated
that
guard
of
coal
and
iron
police
armed
with
winchester
rifles
had
been
requisitioned
for
the
defense
of
the
office
mcMurdo
had
laid
down
the
paper
and
was
lighting
his
pipe
with
hand
which
was
shaky
from
the
excesses
of
the
previous
evening
when
there
was
knock
outside
and
his
landlady
brought
to
him
note
which
had
just
been
handed
in
by
lad
it
was
unsigned
and
ran
thus
should
wish
to
speak
to
you
but
would
rather
not
do
so
in
your
house
you
will
find
me
beside
the
flagstaff
upon
miller
hill
if
you
will
come
there
now
have
something
which
it
is
important
for
you
to
hear
and
for
me
to
say
mcMurdo
read
the
note
twice
with
the
utmost
surprise
for
he
could
not
imagine
what
it
meant
or
who
was
the
author
of
it
had
it
been
in
feminine
hand
he
might
have
imagined
that
it
was
the
beginning
of
one
of
those
adventures
which
had
been
familiar
enough
in
his
past
life
but
it
was
the
writing
of
man
and
of
well
educated
one
too
finally
after
some
hesitation
he
determined
to
see
the
matter
through
miller
hill
is
an
ill
kept
public
park
in
the
very
centre
of
the
town
in
summer
it
is
favourite
resort
of
the
people
but
in
winter
it
is
desolate
enough
from
the
top
of
it
one
has
view
not
only
of
the
whole
straggling
grimy
town
but
of
the
winding
valley
beneath
with
its
scattered
mines
and
factories
blackening
the
snow
on
each
side
of
it
and
of
the
wooded
and
white
capped
ranges
flanking
it
mcMurdo
strolled
up
the
winding
path
hedged
in
with
evergreens
until
he
reached
the
deserted
restaurant
which
forms
the
centre
of
summer
gaiety
beside
it
was
bare
flagstaff
and
underneath
it
man
his
hat
drawn
down
and
the
collar
of
his
overcoat
turned
up
when
he
turned
his
face
mcMurdo
saw
that
it
was
brother
morris
he
who
had
incurred
the
anger
of
the
bodymaster
the
night
before
the
lodge
sign
was
given
and
exchanged
as
they
met
wanted
to
have
word
with
you
mr
mcMurdo
said
the
older
man
speaking
with
hesitation
which
showed
that
he
was
on
delicate
ground
it
was
kind
of
you
to
come
why
did
you
not
put
your
name
to
the
note
one
has
to
be
cautious
mister
one
never
knows
in
times
like
these
how
thing
may
come
back
to
one
never
knows
either
who
to
trust
or
who
not
to
trust
surely
one
may
trust
brothers
of
the
lodge
no
not
always
cried
morris
with
vehemence
whatever
we
say
even
what
we
think
seems
to
go
back
to
that
man
mcGinty
look
here
said
mcMurdo
sternly
it
was
only
last
night
as
you
know
well
that
swore
good
faith
to
our
bodymaster
would
you
be
asking
me
to
break
my
oath
if
that
is
the
view
you
take
said
morris
sadly
can
only
say
that
am
sorry
gave
you
the
trouble
to
come
and
meet
me
things
have
come
to
bad
pass
when
two
free
citizens
cannot
speak
their
thoughts
to
each
other
mcMurdo
who
had
been
watching
his
companion
very
narrowly
relaxed
somewhat
in
his
bearing
sure
spoke
for
myself
only
said
he
am
newcomer
as
you
know
and
am
strange
to
it
all
it
is
not
for
me
to
open
my
mouth
mr
morris
and
if
you
think
well
to
say
anything
to
me
am
here
to
hear
it
and
to
take
it
back
to
boss
mcGinty
said
morris
bitterly
indeed
then
you
do
me
injustice
there
cried
mcMurdo
for
myself
am
loyal
to
the
lodge
and
so
tell
you
straight
but
would
be
poor
creature
if
were
to
repeat
to
any
other
what
you
might
say
to
me
in
confidence
it
will
go
no
further
than
me
though
warn
you
that
you
may
get
neither
help
nor
sympathy
have
given
up
looking
for
either
the
one
or
the
other
said
morris
may
be
putting
my
very
life
in
your
hands
by
what
say
but
bad
as
you
are
and
it
seemed
to
me
last
night
that
you
were
shaping
to
be
as
bad
as
the
worst
still
you
are
new
to
it
and
your
conscience
cannot
yet
be
as
hardened
as
theirs
that
was
why
thought
to
speak
with
you
well
what
have
you
to
say
if
you
give
me
away
may
curse
be
on
you
sure
said
would
not
would
ask
you
then
when
you
joined
the
freeman
society
in
chicago
and
swore
vows
of
charity
and
fidelity
did
ever
it
cross
your
mind
that
you
might
find
it
would
lead
you
to
crime
if
you
call
it
crime
mcMurdo
answered
call
it
crime
cried
morris
his
voice
vibrating
with
passion
you
have
seen
little
of
it
if
you
can
call
it
anything
else
was
it
crime
last
night
when
man
old
enough
to
be
your
father
was
beaten
till
the
blood
dripped
from
his
white
hairs
was
that
crime
or
what
else
would
you
call
it
there
are
some
would
say
it
was
war
said
mcMurdo
war
of
two
classes
with
all
in
so
that
each
struck
as
best
it
could
well
did
you
think
of
such
thing
when
you
joined
the
freeman
society
at
chicago

no
bound
to
say
did
not
nor
did
when
joined
it
at
philadelphia
it
was
just
benefit
club
and
meeting
place
for
one
fellows
then
heard
of
this
place
curse
the
hour
that
the
name
first
fell
upon
my
ears
and
came
to
better
myself
my
god
to
better
myself
my
wife
and
three
children
came
with
me
started
dry
goods
store
on
market
square
and
prospered
well
the
word
had
gone
round
that
was
freeman
and
was
forced
to
join
the
local
lodge
same
as
you
did
last
night
ve
the
badge
of
shame
on
my
forearm
and
something
worse
branded
on
my
heart
found
that
was
under
the
orders
of
black
villain
and
caught
in
meshwork
of
crime
what
could
do
every
word
said
to
make
things
better
was
taken
as
treason
same
as
it
was
last
night
can
get
away
for
all
have
in
the
world
is
in
my
store
if
leave
the
society
know
well
that
it
means
murder
to
me
and
god
knows
what
to
my
wife
and
children
oh
man
it
is
awful
he
put
his
hands
to
his
face
and
his
body
shook
with
convulsive
sobs
mcMurdo
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
were
too
soft
for
the
job
said
he
you
are
the
wrong
sort
for
such
work
had
conscience
and
religion
but
they
made
me
criminal
among
them
was
chosen
for
job
if
backed
down
knew
well
what
would
come
to
me
maybe
coward
maybe
it
the
thought
of
my
poor
little
woman
and
the
children
that
makes
me
one
anyhow
went
guess
it
will
haunt
me
forever
it
was
lonely
house
twenty
miles
from
here
over
the
range
yonder
was
told
off
for
the
door
same
as
you
were
last
night
they
could
not
trust
me
with
the
job
the
others
went
in
when
they
came
out
their
hands
were
crimson
to
the
wrists
as
we
turned
away
child
was
screaming
out
of
the
house
behind
us
it
was
boy
of
five
who
had
seen
his
father
murdered
nearly
fainted
with
the
horror
of
it
and
yet
had
to
keep
bold
and
smiling
face
for
well
knew
that
if
did
not
it
would
be
out
of
my
house
that
they
would
come
next
with
their
bloody
hands
and
it
would
be
my
little
fred
that
would
be
screaming
for
his
father
but
was
criminal
then
part
sharer
in
murder
lost
forever
in
this
world
and
lost
also
in
the
next
am
good
catholic
but
the
priest
would
have
no
word
with
me
when
he
heard
was
scowrer
and
am
excommunicated
from
my
faith
that
how
it
stands
with
me
and
see
you
going
down
the
same
road
and
ask
you
what
the
end
is
to
be
are
you
ready
to
be
cold
blooded
murderer
also
or
can
we
do
anything
to
stop
it
what
would
you
do
asked
mcMurdo
abruptly
you
would
not
inform
god
forbid
cried
morris
sure
the
very
thought
would
cost
me
my
life
that
well
said
mcMurdo
thinking
that
you
are
weak
man
and
that
you
make
too
much
of
the
matter
too
much
wait
till
you
have
lived
here
longer
look
down
the
valley
see
the
cloud
of
hundred
chimneys
that
overshadows
it
tell
you
that
the
cloud
of
murder
hangs
thicker
and
lower
than
that
over
the
heads
of
the
people
it
is
the
valley
of
fear
the
valley
of
death
the
terror
is
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
from
the
dusk
to
the
dawn
wait
young
man
and
you
will
learn
for
yourself
well
ll
let
you
know
what
think
when
have
seen
more
said
mcMurdo
carelessly
what
is
very
clear
is
that
you
are
not
the
man
for
the
place
and
that
the
sooner
you
sell
out
if
you
only
get
dime
dollar
for
what
the
business
is
worth
the
better
it
will
be
for
you
what
you
have
said
is
safe
with
me
but
by
gar
if
thought
you
were
an
informer
no
cried
morris
piteously
well
let
it
rest
at
that
ll
bear
what
you
have
said
in
mind
and
maybe
some
day
ll
come
back
to
it
expect
you
meant
kindly
by
speaking
to
me
like
this
now
ll
be
getting
home
one
word
before
you
go
said
morris
we
may
have
been
seen
together
they
may
want
to
know
what
we
have
spoken
about
ah
that
well
thought
of
offer
you
clerkship
in
my
store
and
refuse
it
that
our
business
well
so
long
brother
morris
and
may
you
find
things
go
better
with
you
in
the
future
that
same
afternoon
as
mcMurdo
sat
smoking
lost
in
thought
beside
the
stove
of
his
sitting
room
the
door
swung
open
and
its
framework
was
filled
with
the
huge
figure
of
boss
mcGinty
he
passed
the
sign
and
then
seating
himself
opposite
to
the
young
man
he
looked
at
him
steadily
for
some
time
look
which
was
as
steadily
returned
not
much
of
visitor
brother
mcMurdo
he
said
at
last
guess
am
too
busy
over
the
folk
that
visit
me
but
thought
stretch
point
and
drop
down
to
see
you
in
your
own
house
proud
to
see
you
here
councillor
mcMurdo
answered
heartily
bringing
his
whisky
bottle
out
of
the
cupboard
it
an
honour
that
had
not
expected
how
the
arm
asked
the
boss
mcMurdo
made
wry
face
well
not
forgetting
it
he
said
but
it
worth
it
yes
it
worth
it
the
other
answered
to
those
that
are
loyal
and
go
through
with
it
and
are
help
to
the
lodge
what
were
you
speaking
to
brother
morris
about
on
miller
hill
this
morning
the
question
came
so
suddenly
that
it
was
well
that
he
had
his
answer
prepared
he
burst
into
hearty
laugh
morris
didn
know
could
earn
living
here
at
home
he
shan
know
either
for
he
has
got
too
much
conscience
for
the
likes
of
me
but
he
good
hearted
old
chap
it
was
his
idea
that
was
at
loose
end
and
that
he
would
do
me
good
turn
by
offering
me
clerkship
in
dry
goods
store
oh
that
was
it
yes
that
was
it
and
you
refused
it
sure
couldn
earn
ten
times
as
much
in
my
own
bedroom
with
four
hours
work
that
so
but
wouldn
get
about
too
much
with
morris
why
not
well
guess
because
tell
you
not
that
enough
for
most
folk
in
these
parts
it
may
be
enough
for
most
folk
but
it
ain
enough
for
me
councillor
said
mcMurdo
boldly
if
you
are
judge
of
men
you
ll
know
that
the
swarthy
giant
glared
at
him
and
his
hairy
paw
closed
for
an
instant
round
the
glass
as
though
he
would
hurl
it
at
the
head
of
his
companion
then
he
laughed
in
his
loud
boisterous
insincere
fashion
you
re
queer
card
for
sure
said
he
well
if
you
want
reasons
ll
give
them
did
morris
say
nothing
to
you
against
the
lodge
no
well
that
because
he
daren
trust
you
but
in
his
heart
he
is
not
loyal
brother
we
know
that
well
so
we
watch
him
and
we
wait
for
the
time
to
admonish
him
thinking
that
the
time
is
drawing
near
there
no
room
for
scabby
sheep
in
our
pen
but
if
you
keep
company
with
disloyal
man
we
might
think
that
you
were
disloyal
too
see
there
no
chance
of
my
keeping
company
with
him
for
dislike
the
man
mcMurdo
answered
as
to
being
disloyal
if
it
was
any
man
but
you
he
would
not
use
the
word
to
me
twice
well
that
enough
said
mcGinty
draining
off
his
glass
came
down
to
give
you
word
in
season
and
you
ve
had
it
like
to
know
said
mcMurdo
how
you
ever
came
to
learn
that
had
spoken
with
morris
at
all
mcGinty
laughed
it
my
business
to
know
what
goes
on
in
this
township
said
he
guess
you
best
reckon
on
my
hearing
all
that
passes
well
time
up
and
ll
just
say
but
his
leavetaking
was
cut
short
in
very
unexpected
fashion
with
sudden
crash
the
door
flew
open
and
three
frowning
intent
faces
glared
in
at
them
from
under
the
peaks
of
police
caps
mcMurdo
sprang
to
his
feet
and
half
drew
his
revolver
but
his
arm
stopped
midway
as
he
became
conscious
that
two
winchester
rifles
were
levelled
at
his
head
man
in
uniform
advanced
into
the
room
six
shooter
in
his
hand
it
was
captain
marvin
once
of
chicago
and
now
of
the
coal
and
iron
constabulary
he
shook
his
head
with
half
smile
at
mcMurdo
thought
you
be
getting
into
trouble
mr
crooked
mcMurdo
of
chicago
said
he
can
keep
out
of
it
can
you
take
your
hat
and
come
along
with
us
guess
you
ll
pay
for
this
captain
marvin
said
mcGinty
who
are
you
like
to
know
to
break
into
house
in
this
fashion
and
molest
honest
law
abiding
men
you
re
standing
out
in
this
deal
councillor
mcGinty
said
the
police
captain
we
are
not
out
after
you
but
after
this
man
mcMurdo
it
is
for
you
to
help
not
to
hinder
us
in
our
duty
he
is
friend
of
mine
and
ll
answer
for
his
conduct
said
the
boss
by
all
accounts
mr
mcGinty
you
may
have
to
answer
for
your
own
conduct
some
of
these
days
the
captain
answered
this
man
mcMurdo
was
crook
before
ever
he
came
here
and
he
crook
still
cover
him
patrolman
while
disarm
him

mcMurdo
coolly

face
to
face
you
would
not
take
me
so
easily

where
your
warrant
asked
mcGinty
by
gar
man
might
as
well
live
in
russia
as
in
vermissa
while
folk
like
you
are
running
the
police
it
capitalist
outrage
and
you
ll
hear
more
of
it
reckon
you
do
what
you
think
is
your
duty
the
best
way
you
can
councillor
we
ll
look
after
ours
what
am
accused
of
asked
mcMurdo
of
being
concerned
in
the
beating
of
old
editor
stanger
at
the
herald
office
it
wasn
your
fault
that
it
isn
murder
charge
well
if
that
all
you
have
against
him
cried
mcGinty
with
laugh
you
can
save
yourself
deal
of
trouble
by
dropping
it
right
now
this
man
was
with
me
in
my
saloon
playing
poker
up
to
midnight
and
can
bring
dozen
to
prove
it
that
your
affair
and
guess
you
can
settle
it
in
court
to
morrow
meanwhile
come
on
mcMurdo
and
come
quietly
if
you
don
want
gun
across
your
head
you
stand
wide
mr
mcGinty
for
warn
you
will
stand
no
resistance
when
am
on
duty
so
determined
was
the
appearance
of
the
captain
that
both
mcMurdo
and
his
boss
were
forced
to
accept
the
situation
the
latter
managed
to
have
few
whispered
words
with
the
prisoner
before
they
parted
what
about
he
jerked
his
thumb
upward
to
signify
the
coining
plant
all
right
whispered
mcMurdo
who
had
devised
safe
hiding
place
under
the
floor
ll
bid
you
good
bye
said
the
boss
shaking
hands
ll
see
reilly
the
lawyer
and
take
the
defence
upon
myself
take
my
word
for
it
that
they
won
be
able
to
hold
you
wouldn
bet
on
that
guard
the
prisoner
you
two
and
shoot
him
if
he
tries
any
games
ll
search
the
house
before
leave
marvin
did
so
but
apparently
found
no
trace
of
the
concealed
plant
when
he
had
descended
he
and
his
men
escorted
mcMurdo
to
headquarters
darkness
had
fallen
and
keen
blizzard
was
blowing
so
that
the
streets
were
nearly
deserted
but
few
loiterers
followed
the
group
and
emboldened
by
invisibility
shouted
imprecations
at
the
prisoner
lynch
the
cursed
scowrer
they
cried
lynch
him
they
laughed
and
jeered
as
he
was
pushed
into
the
police
station
after
short
formal
examination
from
the
inspector
in
charge
he
was
put
into
the
common
cell
here
he
found
baldwin
and
three
other
criminals
of
the
night
before
all
arrested
that
afternoon
and
waiting
their
trial
next
morning
but
even
within
this
inner
fortress
of
the
law
the
long
arm
of
the
freemen
was
able
to
extend
late
at
night
there
came
jailer
with
straw
bundle
for
their
bedding
out
of
which
he
extracted
two
bottles
of
whisky
some
glasses
and
pack
of
cards
they
spent
hilarious
night
without
an
anxious
thought
as
to
the
ordeal
of
the
morning
nor
had
they
cause
as
the
result
was
to
show
the
magistrate
could
not
possibly
on
the
evidence
have
held
them
for
higher
court
on
the
one
hand
the
compositors
and
pressmen
were
forced
to
admit
that
the
light
was
uncertain
that
they
were
themselves
much
perturbed
and
that
it
was
difficult
for
them
to
swear
to
the
identity
of
the
assailants
although
they
believed
that
the
accused
were
among
them
cross
examined
by
the
clever
attorney
who
had
been
engaged
by
mcGinty
they
were
even
more
nebulous
in
their
evidence
the
injured
man
had
already
deposed
that
he
was
so
taken
by
surprise
by
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
that
he
could
state
nothing
beyond
the
fact
that
the
first
man
who
struck
him
wore
moustache
he
added
that
he
knew
them
to
be
scowrers
since
no
one
else
in
the
community
could
possibly
have
any
enmity
to
him
and
he
had
long
been
threatened
on
account
of
his
outspoken
editorials
on
the
other
hand
it
was
clearly
shown
by
the
united
and
unfaltering
evidence
of
six
citizens
including
that
high
municipal
official
councillor
mcGinty
that
the
men
had
been
at
card
party
at
the
union
house
until
an
hour
very
much
later
than
the
commission
of
the
outrage
needless
to
say
that
they
were
discharged
with
something
very
near
to
an
apology
from
the
bench
for
the
inconvenience
to
which
they
had
been
put
together
with
an
implied
censure
of
captain
marvin
and
the
police
for
their
officious
zeal
the
verdict
was
greeted
with
loud
applause
by
court
in
which
mcMurdo
saw
many
familiar
faces
brothers
of
the
lodge
smiled
and
waved
but
there
were
others
who
sat
with
compressed
lips
and
brooding
eyes
as
the
men
filed
out
of
the
dock
one
of
them
little
dark
bearded
resolute
fellow
put
the
thoughts
of
himself
and
comrades
into
words
as
the
ex
prisoners
passed
him
you
damned
murderers
he
said
we
ll
fix
you
yet
the
darkest
hour
if
anything
had
been
needed
to
give
an
impetus
to
jack
mcMurdo
popularity
among
his
fellows
it
would
have
been
his
arrest
and
acquittal
that
man
on
the
very
night
of
joining
the
lodge
should
have
done
something
which
brought
him
before
the
magistrate
was
new
record
in
the
annals
of
the
society
already
he
had
earned
the
reputation
of
good
boon
companion
cheery
reveller
and
withal
man
of
high
temper
who
would
not
take
an
insult
even
from
the
all
powerful
boss
himself
but
in
addition
to
this
he
impressed
his
comrades
with
the
idea
that
among
them
all
there
was
not
one
whose
brain
was
so
ready
to
devise
bloodthirsty
scheme
or
whose
hand
would
be
more
capable
of
carrying
it
out
he
ll
be
the
boy
for
the
clean
job
said
the
oldsters
to
one
another
and
waited
their
time
until
they
could
set
him
to
his
work
mcGinty
had
instruments
enough
already
but
he
recognized
that
this
was
supremely
able
one
he
felt
like
man
holding
fierce
bloodhound
in
leash
there
were
curs
to
do
the
smaller
work
but
some
day
he
would
slip
this
creature
upon
its
prey
few
members
of
the
lodge
ted
baldwin
among
them
resented
the
rapid
rise
of
the
stranger
and
hated
him
for
it
but
they
kept
clear
of
him
for
he
was
as
ready
to
fight
as
to
laugh
but
if
he
gained
favour
with
his
fellows
there
was
another
quarter
one
which
had
become
even
more
vital
to
him
in
which
he
lost
it
ettie
shafter
father
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him
nor
would
he
allow
him
to
enter
the
house
ettie
herself
was
too
deeply
in
love
to
give
him
up
altogether
and
yet
her
own
good
sense
warned
her
of
what
would
come
from
marriage
with
man
who
was
regarded
as
criminal
one
morning
after
sleepless
night
she
determined
to
see
him
possibly
for
the
last
time
and
make
one
strong
endeavour
to
draw
him
from
those
evil
influences
which
were
sucking
him
down
she
went
to
his
house
as
he
had
often
begged
her
to
do
and
made
her
way
into
the
room
which
he
used
as
his
sittingroom
he
was
seated
at
table
with
his
back
turned
and
letter
in
front
of
him
sudden
spirit
of
girlish
mischief
came
over
her
she
was
still
only
nineteen
he
had
not
heard
her
when
she
pushed
open
the
door
now
she
tiptoed
forward
and
laid
her
hand
lightly
upon
his
bended
shoulders
if
she
had
expected
to
startle
him
she
certainly
succeeded
but
only
in
turn
to
be
startled
herself
with
tiger
spring
he
turned
on
her
and
his
right
hand
was
feeling
for
her
throat
at
the
same
instant
with
the
other
hand
he
crumpled
up
the
paper
that
lay
before
him
for
an
instant
he
stood
glaring
then
astonishment
and
joy
took
the
place
of
the
ferocity
which
had
convulsed
his
features
ferocity
which
had
sent
her
shrinking
back
in
horror
as
from
something
which
had
never
before
intruded
into
her
gentle
life
it
you
said
he
mopping
his
brow
and
to
think
that
you
should
come
to
me
heart
of
my
heart
and
should
find
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
want
to
strangle
you
come
then
darling
and
he
held
out
his
arms
let
me
make
it
up
to
you
but
she
had
not
recovered
from
that
sudden
glimpse
of
guilty
fear
which
she
had
read
in
the
man
face
all
her
woman
instinct
told
her
that
it
was
not
the
mere
fright
of
man
who
is
startled
guilt
that
was
it
guilt
and
fear
what
come
over
you
jack
she
cried
why
were
you
so
scared
of
me
oh
jack
if
your
conscience
was
at
ease
you
would
not
have
looked
at
me
like
that
sure
was
thinking
of
other
things
and
when
you
came
tripping
so
lightly
on
those
fairy
feet
of
yours
no
it
was
more
than
that
jack
then
sudden
suspicion
seized
her
let
me
see
that
letter
you
were
writing
ah
ettie
couldn
do
that
her
suspicions
became
certainties
it
to
another
woman
she
cried
know
it
why
else
should
you
hold
it
from
me
was
it
to
your
wife
that
you
were
writing
how
am
to
know
that
you
are
not
married
man
you
stranger
that
nobody
knows
am
not
married
ettie
see
now
swear
it
you
re
the
only
one
woman
on
earth
to
me
by
the
cross
of
christ
swear
it
he
was
so
white
with
passionate
earnestness
that
she
could
not
but
believe
him
well
then
she
cried
why
will
you
not
show
me
the
letter
ll
tell
you
acushla
said
he
under
oath
not
to
show
it
and
just
as
wouldn
break
my
word
to
you
so
would
keep
it
to
those
who
hold
my
promise
it
the
business
of
the
lodge
and
even
to
you
it
secret
and
if
was
scared
when
hand
fell
on
me
can
you
understand
it
when
it
might
have
been
the
hand
of
detective

she
felt
that
he
was
telling
the
truth
he
gathered
her
into
his
arms
and
kissed
away
her
fears
and
doubts
sit
here
by
me
then
it
queer
throne
for
such
queen
but
it
the
best
your
poor
lover
can
find
he
ll
do
better
for
you

of

days

how

it

be
at

know
that

criminals
when

for
murder
mcMurdo
the
scowrer
that
what
one
of
our
boarders
called
you
yesterday
it
went
through
my
heart
like
knife
sure
hard
words
break
no
bones
but
they
were
true
well
dear
it
not
so
bad
as
you
think
we
are
but
poor
men
that
are
trying
in
our
own
way
to
get
our
rights
ettie
threw
her
arms
round
her
lover
neck
give
it
up
jack
for
my
sake
for
god
sake
give
it
up
it
was
to
ask
you
that
came
here
to
day
oh
jack
see
beg
it
of
you
on
my
bended
knees
kneeling
here
before
you
implore
you
to
give
it
up
he
raised
her
and
soothed
her
with
her
head
against
his
breast
sure
my
darlin
you
don
know
what
it
is
you
are
asking
how
could
give
it
up
when
it
would
be
to
break
my
oath
and
to
desert
my
comrades
if
you
could
see
how
things
stand
with
me
you
could
never
ask
it
of
me
besides
if
wanted
to
how
could
do
it
you
don
suppose
that
the
lodge
would
let
man
go
free
with
all
its
secrets
ve
thought
of
that
jack
ve
planned
it
all
father
has
saved
some
money
he
is
weary
of
this
place
where
the
fear
of
these
people
darkens
our
lives
he
is
ready
to
go
we
would
fly
together
to
philadelphia
or
new
york
where
we
would
be
safe
from
them
mcMurdo
laughed
the
lodge
has
long
arm
do
you
think
it
could
not
stretch
from
here
to
philadelphia
or
new
york
well
then
to
the
west
or
to
england
or
to
germany
where
father
came
from
anywhere
to
get
away
from
this
valley
of
fear
mcMurdo
thought
of
old
brother
morris
sure
it
is
the
second
time
have
heard
the
valley
so
named
said
he
the
shadow
does
indeed
seem
to
lie
heavy
on
some
of
you
it
darkens
every
moment
of
our
lives
do
you
suppose
that
ted
baldwin
has
ever
forgiven
us
if
it
were
not
that
he
fears
you
what
do
you
suppose
our
chances
would
be
if
you
saw
the
look
in
those
dark
hungry
eyes
of
his
when
they
fall
on
me
by
gar
teach
him
better
manners
if
caught
him
at
it
but
see
here
little
girl
can
leave
here
can
take
that
from
me
once
and
for
all
but
if
you
will
leave
me
to
find
my
own
way
will
try
to
prepare
way
of
getting
honourably
out
of
it
there
is
no
honour
in
such
matter
well
it
just
how
you
look
at
it
but
if
you
ll
give
me
six
months
ll
work
it
so
that
can
leave
without
being
ashamed
to
look
others
in
the
face
the
girl
laughed
with
joy
six
months
she
cried
is
it
promise
well
it
may
be
seven
or
eight
but
within
year
at
the
furthest
we
will
leave
the
valley
behind
us
it
was
the
most
that
ettie
could
obtain
and
yet
it
was
something
there
was
this
distant
light
to
illuminate
the
gloom
of
the
immediate
future
she
returned
to
her
father
house
more
lighthearted
than
she
had
ever
been
since
jack
mcMurdo
had
come
into
her
life
it
might
be
thought
that
as
member
all
the
doings
of
the
society
would
be
told
to
him
but
he
was
soon
to
discover
that
the
organization
was
wider
and
more
complex
than
the
simple
lodge
even
boss
mcGinty
was
ignorant
as
to
many
things
for
there
was
an
official
named
the
county
delegate
living
at
hobson
patch
farther
down
the
line
who
had
power
over
several
different
lodges
which
he
wielded
in
sudden
and
arbitrary
way
only
once
did
mcMurdo
see
him
sly
little
grey
haired
rat
of
man
with
slinking
gait
and
sidelong
glance
which
was
charged
with
malice
evans
pott
was
his
name
and
even
the
great
boss
of
vermissa
felt
towards
him
something
of
the
repulsion
and
fear
which
the
huge
danton
may
have
felt
for
the
puny
but
dangerous
robespierre
one
day
scanlan
who
was
mcMurdo
fellow
boarder
received
note
from
mcGinty
enclosing
one
from
evans
pott
which
informed
him
that
he
was
sending
over
two
good
men
lawler
and
andrews
who
had
instructions
to
act
in
the
neighbourhood
though
it
was
best
for
the
cause
that
no
particulars
as
to
their
objects
should
be
given
would
the
bodymaster
see
to
it
that
suitable
arrangements
be
made
for
their
lodgings
and
comfort
until
the
time
for
action
should
arrive
mcGinty
added
that
it
was
impossible
for
anyone
to
remain
secret
at
the
union
house
and
that
therefore
he
would
be
obliged
if
mcMurdo
and
scanlan
would
put
the
strangers
up
for
few
days
in
their
boarding
house
the
same
evening
the
two
men
arrived
each
carrying
his
gripsack
lawler
was
an
elderly
man
shrewd
silent
and
self
contained
clad
in
an
old
black
frock
coat
which
with
his
soft
felt
hat
and
ragged
grizzled
beard
gave
him
general
resemblance
to
an
itinerant
preacher
his
companion
andrews
was
little
more
than
boy
frank
faced
and
cheerful
with
the
breezy
manner
of
one
who
is
out
for
holiday
and
means
to
enjoy
every
minute
of
it
both
men
were
total
abstainers
and
behaved
in
all
ways
as
exemplary
members
of
the
society
with
the
one
simple
exception
that
they
were
assassins
who
had
often
proved
themselves
to
be
most
capable
instruments
for
this
association
of
murder
lawler
had
already
carried
out
fourteen
commissions
of
the
kind
and
andrews
three
they
were
as
mcMurdo
found
quite
ready
to
converse
about
their
deeds
in
the
past
which
they
recounted
with
the
half
bashful
pride
of
men
who
had
done
good
and
unselfish
service
for
the
community
they
were
reticent
however
as
to
the
immediate
job
in
hand
they
chose
us
because
neither
nor
the
boy
here
drink
lawler
explained
they
can
count
on
us
saying
no
more
than
we
should
you
must
not
take
it
amiss
but
it
is
the
orders
of
the
county
delegate
that
we
obey
sure
we
are
all
in
it
together
said
scanlan
mcMurdo
mate
as
the
four
sat
together
at
supper
that
true
enough
and
we
ll
talk
till
the
cows
come
home
of
the
killing
of
charlie
williams
or
of
simon
bird
or
any
other
job
in
the
past
but
till
the
work
is
done
we
say
nothing
there
are
half
dozen
about
here
that
have
word
to
say
to
said
mcMurdo
with
an
oath
suppose
it
isn
jack
knox
of
ironhill
that
you
are
after
go
some
way
to
see
him
get
his
deserts
no
it
not
him
yet
or
herman
strauss
no
nor
him
either
well
if
you
won
tell
us
we
can
make
you
but
be
glad
to
know
lawler
smiled
and
shook
his
head
he
was
not
to
be
drawn
in
spite
of
the
reticence
of
their
guests
scanlan
and
mcMurdo
were
quite
determined
to
be
present
at
what
they
called
the
fun
when
therefore
at
an
early
hour
one
morning
mcMurdo
heard
them
creeping
down
the
stairs
he
awakened
scanlan
and
the
two
hurried
on
their
clothes
when
they
were
dressed
they
found
that
the
others
had
stolen
out
leaving
the
door
open
behind
them
it
was
not
yet
dawn
and
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
they
could
see
the
two
men
some
distance
down
the
street
they
followed
them
warily
treading
noiselessly
in
the
deep
snow
the
boarding
house
was
near
the
edge
of
the
town
and
soon
they
were
at
the
crossroads
which
is
beyond
its
boundary
here
three
men
were
waiting
with
whom
lawler
and
andrews
held
short
eager
conversation
then
they
all
moved
on
together
it
was
clearly
some
notable
job
which
needed
numbers
at
this
point
there
are
several
trails
which
lead
to
various
mines
the
strangers
took
that
which
led
to
the
crow
hill
huge
business
which
was
in
strong
hands
which
had
been
able
thanks
to
their
energetic
and
fearless
new
england
manager
josiah
dunn
to
keep
some
order
and
discipline
during
the
long
reign
of
terror
day
was
breaking
now
and
line
of
workmen
were
slowly
making
their
way
singly
and
in
groups
along
the
blackened
path
mcMurdo
and
scanlan
strolled
on
with
the
others
keeping
in
sight
of
the
men
whom
they
followed
thick
mist
lay
over
them
and
from
the
heart
of
it
there
came
the
sudden
scream
of
steam
whistle
it
was
the
ten
minute
signal
before
the
cages
descended
and
the
day
labour
began
when
they
reached
the
open
space
round
the
mine
shaft
there
were
hundred
miners
waiting
stamping
their
feet
and
blowing
on
their
fingers
for
it
was
bitterly
cold
the
strangers
stood
in
little
group
under
the
shadow
of
the
engine
house
scanlan
and
mcMurdo
climbed
heap
of
slag
from
which
the
whole
scene
lay
before
them
they
saw
the
mine
engineer
great
bearded
scotchman
named
menzies
come
out
of
the
engine
house
and
blow
his
whistle
for
the
cages
to
be
lowered
at
the
same
instant
tall
loose
framed
young
man
with
clean
shaved
earnest
face
advanced
eagerly
towards
the
pit
head
as
he
came
forward
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
group
silent
and
motionless
under
the
engine
house
the
men
had
drawn
down
their
hats
and
turned
up
their
collars
to
screen
their
faces
for
moment
the
presentiment
of
death
laid
its
cold
hand
upon
the
manager
heart
at
the
next
he
had
shaken
it
off
and
saw
only
his
duty
towards
intrusive
strangers

who
are
you
he
asked
as
he
advanced
what
are
you
loitering
there
for
there
was
no
answer
but
the
lad
andrews
stepped
forward
and
shot
him
in
the
stomach
the
hundred
waiting
miners
stood
as
motionless
and
helpless
as
if
they
were
paralyzed
the
manager
clapped
his
two
hands
to
the
wound
and
doubled
himself
up
then
he
staggered
away
but
another
of
the
assassins
fired
and
he
went
down
sidewise
kicking
and
clawing
among
heap
of
clinkers
menzies
the
scotchman
gave
roar
of
rage
at
the
sight
and
rushed
with
an
iron
spanner
at
the
murderers
but
was
met
by
two
balls
in
the
face
which
dropped
him
dead
at
their
very
feet
there
was
surge
forward
of
some
of
the
miners
and
an
inarticulate
cry
of
pity
and
of
anger
but
couple
of
the
strangers
emptied
their
six
shooters
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
and
they
broke
and
scattered
some
of
them
rushing
wildly
back
to
their
homes
in
vermissa
when
few
of
the
bravest
had
rallied
and
there
was
return
to
the
mine
the
murderous
gang
had
vanished
in
the
mists
of
morning
without
single
witness
being
able
to
swear
to
the
identity
of
these
men
who
in
front
of
hundred
spectators
had
wrought
this
double
crime
scanlan
and
mcMurdo
made
their
way
back
scanlan
somewhat
subdued
for
it
was
the
first
murder
job
that
he
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
and
it
appeared
less
funny
than
he
had
been
led
to
believe
the
horrible
screams
of
the
dead
manager
wife
pursued
them
as
they
hurried
to
the
town
mcMurdo
was
absorbed
and
silent
but
he
showed
no
sympathy
for
the
weakening
of
his
companion
sure
it
is
like
war
he
repeated
what
is
it
but
war
between
us
and
them
and
we
hit
back
where
we
best
can
there
was
high
revel
in
the
lodge
room
at
the
union
house
that
night
not
only
over
the
killing
of
the
manager
and
engineer
of
the
crow
hill
mine
which
would
bring
this
organization
into
line
with
the
other
blackmailed
and
terror
stricken
companies
of
the
district
but
also
over
distant
triumph
which
had
been
wrought
by
the
hands
of
the
lodge
itself
it
would
appear
that
when
the
county
delegate
had
sent
over
five
good
men
to
strike
blow
in
vermissa
he
had
demanded
that
in
return
three
vermissa
men
should
be
secretly
selected
and
sent
across
to
kill
william
hales
of
stake
royal
one
of
the
best
known
and
most
popular
mine
owners
in
the
gilmerton
district
man
who
was
believed
not
to
have
an
enemy
in
the
world
for
he
was
in
all
ways
model
employer
he
had
insisted
however
upon
efficiency
in
the
work
and
had
therefore
paid
off
certain
drunken
and
idle
employees
who
were
members
of
the
allpowerful
society
coffin
notices
hung
outside
his
door
had
not
weakened
his
resolution
and
so
in
free
civilized
country
he
found
himself
condemned
to
death
the
execution
had
now
been
duly
carried
out
ted
baldwin
who
sprawled
now
in
the
seat
of
honour
beside
the
bodymaster
had
been
chief
of
the
party
his
flushed
face
and
glazed
blood
shot
eyes
told
of
sleeplessness
and
drink
he
and
his
two
comrades
had
spent
the
night
before
among
the
mountains
they
were
unkempt
and
weather
stained
but
no
heroes
returning
from
forlorn
hope
could
have
had
warmer
welcome
from
their
comrades
the
story
was
told
and
retold
amid
cries
of
delight
and
shouts
of
laughter
they
had
waited
for
their
man
as
he
drove
home
at
nightfall
taking
their
station
at
the
top
of
steep
hill
where
his
horse
must
be
at
walk
he
was
so
furred
to
keep
out
the
cold
that
he
could
not
lay
his
hand
on
his
pistol
they
had
pulled
him
out
and
shot
him
again
and
again
he
had
screamed
for
mercy
the
screams
were
repeated
for
the
amusement
of
the
lodge
let
hear
again
how
he
squealed
they
cried
none
of
them
knew
the
man
but
there
is
eternal
drama
in
killing
and
they
had
shown
the
scowrers
of
gilmerton
that
the
vermissa
men
were
to
be
relied
upon
there
had
been
one
contretemps
for
man
and
his
wife
had
driven
up
while
they
were
still
emptying
their
revolvers
into
the
silent
body
it
had
been
suggested
that
they
should
shoot
them
both
but
they
were
harmless
folk
who
were
not
connected
with
the
mines
so
they
were
sternly
bidden
to
drive
on
and
keep
silent
lest
worse
thing
befall
them
and
so
the
blood
mottled
figure
had
been
left
as
warning
to
all
such
hard
hearted
employers
and
the
three
noble
avengers
had
hurried
off
into
the
mountains
where
unbroken
nature
comes
down
to
the
very
edge
of
the
furnaces
and
the
slag
heaps
here
they
were
safe
and
sound
their
work
well
done
and
the
plaudits
of
their
companions
in
their
ears
it
had
been
great
day
for
the
scowrers
the
shadow
had
fallen
even
darker
over
the
valley
but
as
the
wise
general
chooses
the
moment
of
victory
in
which
to
redouble
his
efforts
so
that
his
foes
may
have
no
time
to
steady
themselves
after
disaster
so
boss
mcGinty
looking
out
upon
the
scene
of
his
operations
with
his
brooding
and
malicious
eyes
had
devised
new
attack
upon
those
who
opposed
him
that
very
night
as
the
half
drunken
company
broke
up
he
touched
mcMurdo
on
the
arm
and
led
him
aside
into
that
inner
room
where
they
had
their
first
interview
see
here
my
lad
said
he
ve
got
job
that
worthy
of
you
at
last
you
ll
have
the
doing
of
it
in
your
own
hands
proud
am
to
hear
it
mcMurdo
answered
you
can
take
two
men
with
you
manders
and
reilly
they
have
been
warned
for
service
we
ll
never
be
right
in
this
district
until
chester
wilcox
has
been
settled
and
you
ll
have
the
thanks
of
every
lodge
in
the
coal
fields
if
you
can
down
him
ll
do
my
best
anyhow
who
is
he
and
where
shall
find
him
mcGinty
took
his
eternal
half
chewed
half
smoked
cigar
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
proceeded
to
draw
rough
diagram
on
page
torn
from
his
notebook
he
the
chief
foreman
of
the
iron
dike
company
he
hard
citizen
an
old
colour
sergeant
of
the
war
all
scars
and
grizzle
we
ve
had
two
tries
at
him
but
had
no
luck
and
jim
carnaway
lost
his
life
over
it
now
it
for
you
to
take
it
over
that
the
house
all
alone
at
the
iron
dike
crossroad
same
as
you
see
here
on
the
map
without
another
within
earshot
it
no
good
by
day
he
armed
and
shoots
quick
and
straight
with
no
questions
asked
but
at
night
well
there
he
is
with
his
wife
three
children
and
hired
help
you
can
pick
or
choose
it
all
or
none
if
you
could
get
bag
of
blasting
powder
at
the
front
door
with
slow
match
to
it
what
the
man
done
didn
tell
you
he
shot
jim
carnaway
why
did
he
shoot
him
what
in
thunder
has
that
to
do
with
you
carnaway
was
about
his
house
at
night
and
he
shot
him
that
enough
for
me
and
you
ve
got
to
settle
the
thing
right
there
these
two
women
and
the
children
do
they
go
up
too
they
have
to
else
how
can
we
get
him
it
seems
hard
on
them
for
they
ve
done
nothing
what
sort
of
fool
talk
is
this
do
you
back
out
easy
councillor
easy
what
have
ever
said
or
done
that
you
should
think
would
be
after
standing
back
from
an
order
of
the
bodymaster
of
my
own
lodge
if
it
right
or
if
it
wrong
it
for
you
to
decide
you
ll
do
it
then
of
course
will
do
it
when
well
you
had
best
give
me
night
or
two
that
may
see
the
house
and
make
my
plans
then
very
good
said
mcGinty
shaking
him
by
the
hand
leave
it
with
you
it
will
be
great
day
when
you
bring
us
the
news
it
just
the
last
stroke
that
will
bring
them
all
to
their
knees
mcMurdo
thought
long
and
deeply
over
the
commission
which
had
been
so
suddenly
placed
in
his
hands
the
isolated
house
in
which
chester
wilcox
lived
was
about
five
miles
off
in
an
adjacent
valley
that
very
night
he
started
off
all
alone
to
prepare
for
the
attempt
it
was
daylight
before
he
returned
from
his
reconnaissance
next
day
he
interviewed
his
two
subordinates
manders
and
reilly
reckless
youngsters
who
were
as
elated
as
if
it
were
deer
hunt
two
nights
later
they
met
outside
the
town
all
three
armed
and
one
of
them
carrying
sack
stuffed
with
the
powder
which
was
used
in
the
quarries
it
was
two
in
the
morning
before
they
came
to
the
lonely
house
the
night
was
windy
one
with
broken
clouds
drifting
swiftly
across
the
face
of
three
quarter
moon
they
had
been
warned
to
be
on
their
guard
against
bloodhounds
so
they
moved
forward
cautiously
with
their
pistols
cocked
in
their
hands
but
there
was
no
sound
save
the
howling
of
the
wind
and
no
movement
but
the
swaying
branches
above
them
mcMurdo
listened
at
the
door
of
the
lonely
house
but
all
was
still
within
then
he
leaned
the
powder
bag
against
it
ripped
hole
in
it
with
his
knife
and
attached
the
fuse
when
it
was
well
alight
he
and
his
two
companions
took
to
their
heels
and
were
some
distance
off
safe
and
snug
in
sheltering
ditch
before
the
shattering
roar
of
the
explosion
with
the
low
deep
rumble
of
the
collapsing
building
told
them
that
their
work
was
done
no
cleaner
job
had
ever
been
carried
out
in
the
bloodstained
annals
of
the
society

but
alas
that
work
so
well
organized
and
boldly
carried
out
should
all
have
gone
for
nothing
warned
by
the
fate
of
the
various
victims
and
knowing
that
he
was
marked
down
for
destruction
chester
wilcox
had
moved
himself
and
his
family
only
the
day
before
to
some
safer
and
less
known
quarters
where
guard
of
police
should
watch
over
them
it
was
an
empty
house
which
had
been
torn
down
by
the
gunpowder
and
the
grim
old
colour
sergeant
of
the
war
was
still
teaching
discipline
to
the
miners
of
iron
dike
leave
him
to
me
said
mcMurdo
he
my
man
and
ll
get
him
sure
if
have
to
wait
year
for
him
vote
of
thanks
and
confidence
was
passed
in
full
lodge
and
so
for
the
time
the
matter
ended
when
few
weeks
later
it
was
reported
in
the
papers
that
wilcox
had
been
shot
at
from
an
ambuscade
it
was
an
open
secret
that
mcMurdo
was
still
at
work
upon
his
unfinished
job
such
were
the
methods
of
the
society
of
freemen
and
such
were
the
deeds
of
the
scowrers
by
which
they
spread
their
rule
of
fear
over
the
great
and
rich
district
which
was
for
so
long
period
haunted
by
their
terrible
presence
why
should
these
pages
be
stained
by
further
crimes
have
not
said
enough
to
show
the
men
and
their
methods
these
deeds
are
written
in
history
and
there
are
records
wherein
one
may
read
the
details
of
them
there
one
may
learn
of
the
shooting
of
policemen
hunt
and
evans
because
they
had
ventured
to
arrest
two
members
of
the
society
double
outrage
planned
at
the
vermissa
lodge
and
carried
out
in
cold
blood
upon
two
helpless
and
disarmed
men
there
also
one
may
read
of
the
shooting
of
mrs
larbey
when
she
was
nursing
her
husband
who
had
been
beaten
almost
to
death
by
orders
of
boss
mcGinty
the
killing
of
the
elder
jenkins
shortly
followed
by
that
of
his
brother
the
mutilation
of
james
murdoch
the
blowing
up
of
the
staphouse
family
and
the
murder
of
the
stendals
all
followed
hard
upon
one
another
in
the
same
terrible
winter
darkly
the
shadow
lay
upon
the
valley
of
fear
the
spring
had
come
with
running
brooks
and
blossoming
trees
there
was
hope
for
all
nature
bound
so
long
in
an
iron
grip
but
nowhere
was
there
any
hope
for
the
men
and
women
who
lived
under
the
yoke
of
the
terror
never
had
the
cloud
above
them
been
so
dark
and
hopeless
as
in
the
early
summer
of
the
year
75
vi
danger
it
was
the
height
of
the
reign
of
terror
mcMurdo
who
had
already
been
appointed
inner
deacon
with
every
prospect
of
some
day
succeeding
mcGinty
as
bodymaster
was
now
so
necessary
to
the
councils
of
his
comrades
that
nothing
was
done
without
his
help
and
advice
the
more
popular
he
became
however
with
the
freemen
the
blacker
were
the
scowls
which
greeted
him
as
he
passed
along
the
streets
of
vermissa
in
spite
of
their
terror
the
citizens
were
taking
heart
to
band
themselves
together
against
their
oppressors
rumours
had
reached
the
lodge
of
secret
gatherings
in
the
herald
office
and
of
distribution
of
firearms
among
the
law
abiding
people
but
mcGinty
and
his
men
were
undisturbed
by
such
reports
they
were
numerous
resolute
and
well
armed
their
opponents
were
scattered
and
powerless
it
would
all
end
as
it
had
done
in
the
past
in
aimless
talk
and
possibly
in
impotent
arrests
so
said
mcGinty
mcMurdo
and
all
the
bolder
spirits
it
was
saturday
evening
in
may
saturday
was
always
the
lodge
night
and
mcMurdo
was
leaving
his
house
to
attend
it
when
morris
the
weaker
brother
of
the
order
came
to
see
him
his
brow
was
creased
with
care
and
his
kindly
face
was
drawn
and
haggard
can
speak
with
you
freely
mr
mcMurdo
sure
can
forget
that
spoke
my
heart
to
you
once
and
that
you
kept
it
to
yourself
even
though
the
boss
himself
came
to
ask
you
about
it
what
else
could
do
if
you
trusted
me
it
wasn
that
agreed
with
what
you
said
know
that
well
but
you
are
the
one
that
can
speak
to
and
be
safe
ve
secret
here
he
put
his
hand
to
his
breast
and
it
is
just
burning
the
life
out
of
me
wish
it
had
come
to
any
one
of
you
but
me
if
tell
it
will
mean
murder
for
sure
if
don
it
may
bring
the
end
of
us
all
god
help
me
but
am
near
out
of
my
wits
over
it
mcMurdo
looked
at
the
man
earnestly
he
was
trembling
in
every
limb
he
poured
some
whisky
into
glass
and
handed
it
to
him
that
the
physic
for
the
likes
of
you
said
he
now
let
me
hear
of
it
morris
drank
and
his
white
face
took
tinge
of
colour
can
tell
it
to
you
all
in
one
sentence
said
he
there
detective
on
our
trail
mcMurdo
stared
at
him
in
astonishment
why
man
you
re
crazy
he
said
isn
the
place
full
of
police
and
detectives
and
what
harm
did
they
ever
do
us
no
it
no
man
of
the
district
as
you
say
we
know
them
and
it
is
little
that
they
can
do
but
you
ve
heard
of
pinkerton
ve
read
of
some
folk
of
that
name
well
you
can
take
it
from
me
you
ve
no
show
when
they
are
on
your
trail
it
not
take
it
or
miss
it
government
concern
it
dead
earnest
business
proposition
that
out
for
results
and
keeps
out
till
by
hook
or
crook
it
gets
them
if
pinkerton
man
is
deep
in
this
business
we
are
all
destroyed
we
must
kill
him
ah
it
the
first
thought
that
came
to
you
so
it
will
be
up
at
the
lodge
didn
say
to
you
that
it
would
end
in
murder
sure
what
is
murder
isn
it
common
enough
in
these
parts
it
is
indeed
but
it
not
for
me
to
point
out
the
man
that
is
to
be
murdered
never
rest
easy
again
and
yet
it
our
own
necks
that
may
be
at
stake
in
god
name
what
shall
do
he
rocked
to
and
fro
in
his
agony
of
indecision
but
his
words
had
moved
mcMurdo
deeply
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
shared
the
other
opinion
as
to
the
danger
and
the
need
for
meeting
it
he
gripped
morris
shoulder
and
shook
him
in
his
earnestness
see
here
man
he
cried
and
he
almost
screeched
the
words
in
his
excitement
you
won
gain
anything
by
sitting
keening
like
an
old
wife
at
wake
let
have
the
facts
who
is
the
fellow
where
is
he
how
did
you
hear
of
him
why
did
you
come
to
me
came
to
you
for
you
are
the
one
man
that
would
advise
me
told
you
that
had
store
in
the
east
before
came
here
left
good
friends
behind
me
and
one
of
them
is
in
the
telegraph
service
here
letter
that
had
from
him
yesterday
it
this
part
from
the
top
of
the
page
you
can
read
it
yourself
this
was
what
mcMurdo
read
how
are
the
scowrers
getting
on
in
your
parts
we
read
plenty
of
them
in
the
papers
between
you
and
me
expect
to
hear
news
from
you
before
long
five
big
corporations
and
the
two
railroads
have
taken
the
thing
up
in
dead
earnest
they
mean
it
and
you
can
bet
they
ll
get
there
they
are
right
deep
down
into
it
pinkerton
has
taken
hold
under
their
orders
and
his
best
man
birdy
edwards
is
operating
the
thing
has
got
to
be
stopped
right
now
read
the
postscript
of
course
what
give
you
is
what
learned
in
business
so
it
goes
no
further
it
queer
cipher
that
you
handle
by
the
yard
every
day
and
can
get
no
meaning
from
mcMurdo
sat
in
silence
for
some
time
with
the
letter
in
his
listless
hands
the
mist
had
lifted
for
moment
and
there
was
the
abyss
before
him
does
anyone
else
know
of
this
he
asked
have
told
no
one
else
but
this
man
your
friend
has
he
any
other
person
that
he
would
be
likely
to
write
to
well
dare
say
he
knows
one
or
two
more
of
the
lodge
it
likely
enough
was
asking
because
it
is
likely
that
he
may
have
given
some
description
of
this
fellow
birdy
edwards
then
we
could
get
on
his
trail
well
it
possible
but
should
not
think
he
knew
him
he
is
just
telling
me
the
news
that
came
to
him
by
way
of
business
how
would
he
know
this
pinkerton
man
mcMurdo
gave
violent
start
by
gar
he
cried
ve
got
him
what
fool
was
not
to
know
it
lord
but
we
re
in
luck
we
will
fix
him
before
he
can
do
any
harm
see
here
morris
will
you
leave
this
thing
in
my
hands
sure
if
you
will
only
take
it
off
mine
ll
do
that
you
can
stand
right
back
and
let
me
run
it
even
your
name
need
not
be
mentioned
ll
take
it
all
on
myself
as
if
it
were
to
me
that
this
letter
has
come
will
that
content
you
it
just
what
would
ask
then
leave
it
at
that
and
keep
your
head
shut
now
ll
get
down
to
the
lodge
and
we
ll
soon
make
old
man
pinkerton
sorry
for
himself
you
wouldn
kill
this
man
the
less
you
know
friend
morris
the
easier
your
conscience
will
be
and
the
better
you
will
sleep
ask
no
questions
and
let
these
things
settle
themselves
have
hold
of
it
now
morris
shook
his
head
sadly
as
he
left
feel
that
his
blood
is
on
my
hands

self
protection
is
no
murder
anyhow
said
mcMurdo
smiling
grimly
it
him
or
us
guess
this
man
would
destroy
us
all
if
we
left
him
long
in
the
valley
why
brother
morris
we
ll
have
to
elect
you
bodymaster
yet
for
you
ve
surely
saved
the
lodge
and
yet
it
was
clear
from
his
actions
that
he
thought
more
seriously
of
this
new
intrusion
than
his
words
would
show
it
may
have
been
his
guilty
conscience
it
may
have
been
the
reputation
of
the
pinkerton
organization
it
may
have
been
the
knowledge
that
great
rich
corporations
had
set
themselves
the
task
of
clearing
out
the
scowrers
but
whatever
his
reason
his
actions
were
those
of
man
who
is
preparing
for
the
worst
every
paper
which
would
incriminate
him
was
destroyed
before
he
left
the
house
after
that
he
gave
long
sigh
of
satisfaction
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
safe
and
yet
the
danger
must
still
have
pressed
somewhat
upon
him
for
on
his
way
to
the
lodge
he
stopped
at
old
man
shafter
the
house
was
forbidden
him
but
when
he
tapped
at
the
window
ettie
came
out
to
him
the
dancing
irish
devilry
had
gone
from
her
lover
eyes
she
read
his
danger
in
his
earnest
face
something
has
happened
she
cried
oh
jack
you
are
in
danger
sure
it
is
not
very
bad
my
sweetheart
and
yet
it
may
be
wise
that
we
make
move
before
it
is
worse
make
move
promised
you
once
that
would
go
some
day
think
the
time
is
coming
had
news
to
night
bad
news
and
see
trouble
coming
the
police
well
pinkerton
but
sure
you
wouldn
know
what
that
is
acushla
nor
what
it
may
mean
to
the
likes
of
me
too
deep
in
this
thing
and
may
have
to
get
out
of
it
quick
you
said
you
would
come
with
me
if
went
oh
jack
it
would
be
the
saving
of
you
an
honest
man
in
some
things
ettie
wouldn
hurt
hair
of
your
bonny
head
for
all
that
the
world
can
give
nor
ever
pull
you
down
one
inch
from
the
golden
throne
above
the
clouds
where
always
see
you
would
you
trust
me
she
put
her
hand
in
his
without
word

to
what

and
do
as
order

indeed

the
only
way
for
us

going
to
happen
in
this
valley

it
in
my
bones

may
be
many
of
us

have
to
look
out
for
ourselves

day
or
night

that
must
come
with
me

closed
to
me
and

police

just
word
to
you
and
when
it
reaches

drop
everything

waiting
room

the
depot
and

till

or

ll
come
at
the
word
jack
somewhat
eased
in
mind
now
that
his
own
preparations
for
escape
had
been
begun
mcMurdo
went
on
to
the
lodge
it
had
already
assembled
and
only
by
complicated
signs
and
countersigns
could
he
pass
through
the
outer
guard
and
inner
guard
who
close
tiled
it
buzz
of
pleasure
and
welcome
greeted
him
as
he
entered
the
long
room
was
crowded
and
through
the
haze
of
tobacco
smoke
he
saw
the
tangled
black
mane
of
the
bodymaster
the
cruel
unfriendly
features
of
baldwin
the
vulture
face
of
harraway
the
secretary
and
dozen
more
who
were
among
the
leaders
of
the
lodge
he
rejoiced
that
they
should
all
be
there
to
take
counsel
over
his
news
indeed
it
glad
we
are
to
see
you
brother
cried
the
chairman
there
business
here
that
wants
solomon
in
judgment
to
set
it
right
it
lander
and
egan
explained
his
neighbour
as
he
took
his
seat
they
both
claim
the
head
money
given
by
the
lodge
for
the
shooting
of
old
man
crabbe
over
at
stylestown
and
who
to
say
which
fired
the
bullet
mcMurdo
rose
in
his
place
and
raised
his
hand
the
expression
of
his
face
froze
the
attention
of
the
audience
there
was
dead
hush
of
expectation
worshipful
master
he
said
in
solemn
voice
claim
urgency
brother
mcMurdo
claims
urgency
said
mcGinty
it
claim
that
by
the
rules
of
this
lodge
takes
precedence
now
brother
we
attend
you
mcMurdo
took
the
letter
from
his
pocket
worshipful
master
and
brethren
he
said
am
the
bearer
of
ill
news
this
day
but
it
is
better
that
it
should
be
known
and
discussed
than
that
blow
should
fall
upon
us
without
warning
which
would
destroy
us
all
have
information
that
the
most
powerful
and
richest
organizations
in
this
state
have
bound
themselves
together
for
our
destruction
and
that
at
this
very
moment
there
is
pinkerton
detective
one
birdy
edwards
at
work
in
the
valley
collecting
the
evidence
which
may
put
rope
round
the
necks
of
many
of
us
and
send
every
man
in
this
room
into
felon
cell
that
is
the
situation
for
the
discussion
of
which
have
made
claim
of
urgency
there
was
dead
silence
in
the
room
it
was
broken
by
the
chairman
what
is
your
evidence
for
this
brother
mcMurdo
he
asked
it
is
in
this
letter
which
has
come
into
my
hands
said
mcMurdo
me
read
the
passage
aloud
it
is
matter
of
honour
with
me
that
can
give
no
further
particulars
about
the
letter
nor
put
it
into
your
hands
but
assure
you
that
there
is
nothing
else
in
it
which
can
affect
the
interests
of
the
lodge
put
the
case
before
you
as
it
has
reached
me
let
me
say
mr
chairman
said
one
of
the
older
brethren
that
have
heard
of
birdy
edwards
and
that
he
has
the
name
of
being
the
best
man
in
the
pinkerton
service
does
anyone
know
him
by
sight
asked
mcGinty
yes
said
mcMurdo
do
there
was
murmur
of
astonishment
through
the
hall
believe
we
hold
him
in
the
hollow
of
our
hands
he
continued
with
an
exulting
smile
upon
his
face
if
we
act
quickly
and
wisely
we
can
cut
this
thing
short
if
have
your
confidence
and
your
help
it
is
little
that
we
have
to
fear
what
have
we
to
fear
anyhow
what
can
he
know
of
our
affairs
you
might
say
so
if
all
were
as
stanch
as
you
councillor
but
this
man
has
all
the
millions
of
the
capitalists
at
his
back
do
you
think
there
is
no
weaker
brother
among
all
our
lodges
that
could
not
be
bought
he
will
get
at
our
secrets
maybe
has
got
them
already
there
only
one
sure
cure
that
he
never
leaves
the
valley
said
baldwin
mcMurdo
nodded
good
for
you
brother
baldwin
he
said
you
and
have
had
our
differences
but
you
have
said
the
true
word
to
night
where
is
he
then
where
shall
we
know
him
worshipful
master
said
mcMurdo
earnestly
would
put
it
to
you
that
this
is
too
vital
thing
for
us
to
discuss
in
open
lodge
god
forbid
that
should
throw
doubt
on
anyone
here
but
if
so
much
as
word
of
gossip
got
to
the
ears
of
this
man
there
would
be
an
end
of
any
chance
of
our
getting
him
would
ask
the
lodge
to
choose
trusty
committee
mr
chairman
yourself
if
might
suggest
it
and
brother
baldwin
here
and
five
more
then
can
talk
freely
of
what
know
and
of
what
advise
should
be
done
the
proposition
was
at
once
adopted
and
the
committee
chosen
besides
the
chairman
and
baldwin
there
were
the
vulture
faced
secretary
harraway
tiger
cormac
the
brutal
young
assassin
carter
the
treasurer
and
the
brothers
willaby
fearless
and
desperate
men
who
would
stick
at
nothing
the
usual
revelry
of
the
lodge
was
short
and
subdued
for
there
was
cloud
upon
the
men
spirits
and
many
there
for
the
first
time
began
to
see
the
cloud
of
avenging
law
drifting
up
in
that
serene
sky
under
which
they
had
dwelt
so
long
the
horrors
they
had
dealt
out
to
others
had
been
so
much
part
of
their
settled
lives
that
the
thought
of
retribution
had
become
remote
one
and
so
seemed
the
more
startling
now
that
it
came
so
closely
upon
them
they
broke
up
early
and
left
their
leaders
to
their
council
now
mcMurdo
said
mcGinty
when
they
were
alone
the
seven
men
sat
frozen
in
their
seats
said
just
now
that
knew
birdy
edwards
mcMurdo
explained
need
not
tell
you
that
he
is
not
here
under
that
name
he
brave
man
but
not
crazy
one
he
passes
under
the
name
of
steve
wilson
and
he
is
lodging
at
hobson
patch
how
do
you
know
this
because
fell
into
talk
with
him
thought
little
of
it
at
the
time
nor
would
have
given
it
second
thought
but
for
this
letter
but
now
sure
it
the
man
met
him
on
the
cars
when
went
down
the
line
on
wednesday
hard
case
if
ever
there
was
one
he
said
he
was
reporter
believed
it
for
the
moment
wanted
to
know
all
he
could
about
the
scowrers
and
what
he
called
the
outrages
for
new
york
paper
asked
me
every
kind
of
question
so
as
to
get
something
you
bet
was
giving
nothing
away
pay
for
it
and
pay
well
said
he
if
could
get
some
stuff
that
would
suit
my
editor
said
what
thought
would
please
him
best
and
he
handed
me
twenty
dollar
bill
for
my
information
there
ten
times
that
for
you
said
he
if
you
can
find
me
all
that
want
what
did
you
tell
him
then
any
stuff
could
make
up
how
do
you
know
he
wasn
newspaper
man
ll
tell
you
he
got
out
at
hobson
patch
and
so
did
chanced
into
the
telegraph
bureau
and
he
was
leaving
it
see
here
said
the
operator
after
he
gone
out
guess
we
should
charge
double
rates
for
this
guess
you
should
said
he
had
filled
the
form
with
stuff
that
might
have
been
chinese
for
all
we
could
make
of
it
he
fires
sheet
of
this
off
every
day
said
the
clerk
yes
said
it
special
news
for
his
paper
and
he
scared
that
the
others
should
tap
it
that
was
what
the
operator
thought
and
what
thought
at
the
time
but
think
differently
now
by
gar
believe
you
are
right
said
mcGinty
but
what
do
you
allow
that
we
should
do
about
it
why
not
go
right
down
now
and
fix
him
someone
suggested
ay
the
sooner
the
better
start
this
next
minute
if
knew
where
we
could
find
him
said
mcMurdo
he
in
hobson
patch
but
don
know
the
house
ve
got
plan
though
if
you
ll
only
take
my
advice
well
what
is
it
ll
go
to
the
patch
to
morrow
morning
ll
find
him
through
the
operator
he
can
locate
him
guess
well
then
ll
tell
him
that
freeman
myself
ll
offer
him
all
the
secrets
of
the
lodge
for
price
you
bet
he
ll
tumble
to
it
ll
tell
him
the
papers
are
at
my
house
and
that
it
as
much
as
my
life
would
be
worth
to
let
him
come
while
folk
were
about
he
ll
see
that
horse
sense
let
him
come
at
ten
clock
at
night
and
he
shall
see
everything
that
will
fetch
him
sure
well
you
can
plan
the
rest
for
yourselves
widow
macNamara
is
lonely
house
she
as
true
as
steel
and
as
deaf
as
post
there
only
scanlan
and
me
in
the
house
if
get
his
promise
and

let

of
you

of
birdy

luck
for
the
rest
of
his
days
there
going

mcMurdo

to
morrow
we
ll
be
with
you
once
get
the
door
shut
behind
him
and
you
can
leave
the
rest
with
us
vii
the
trapping
of
birdy
edwards
as
mcMurdo
had
said
the
house
in
which
he
lived
was
lonely
one
and
very
well
suited
for
such
crime
as
they
had
planned
it
was
on
the
extreme
fringe
of
the
town
and
stood
well
back
from
the
road
in
any
other
case
the
conspirators
would
have
simply
called
out
their
man
as
they
had
many
time
before
and
emptied
their
pistols
into
his
body
but
in
this
instance
it
was
very
necessary
to
find
out
how
much
he
knew
how
he
knew
it
and
what
had
been
passed
on
to
his
employers
it
was
possible
that
they
were
already
too
late
and
that
the
work
had
been
done
if
that
was
indeed
so
they
could
at
least
have
their
revenge
upon
the
man
who
had
done
it
but
they
were
hopeful
that
nothing
of
great
importance
had
yet
come
to
the
detective
knowledge
as
otherwise
they
argued
he
would
not
have
troubled
to
write
down
and
forward
such
trivial
information
as
mcMurdo
claimed
to
have
given
him
however
all
this
they
would
learn
from
his
own
lips
once
in
their
power
they
would
find
way
to
make
him
speak
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
they
had
handled
an
unwilling
witness
mcMurdo
went
to
hobson
patch
as
agreed
the
police
seemed
to
take
particular
interest
in
him
that
morning
and
captain
marvin
he
who
had
claimed
the
old
acquaintance
with
him
at
chicago
actually
addressed
him
as
he
waited
at
the
station
mcMurdo
turned
away
and
refused
to
speak
with
him
he
was
back
from
his
mission
in
the
afternoon
and
saw
mcGinty
at
the
union
house
he
is
coming
he
said
good
said
mcGinty
the
giant
was
in
his
shirt
sleeves
with
chains
and
seals
gleaming
athwart
his
ample
waistcoat
and
diamond
twinkling
through
the
fringe
of
his
bristling
beard
drink
and
politics
had
made
the
boss
very
rich
as
well
as
powerful
man
the
more
terrible
therefore
seemed
that
glimpse
of
the
prison
or
the
gallows
which
had
risen
before
him
the
night
before
do
you
reckon
he
knows
much
he
asked
anxiously
mcMurdo
shook
his
head
gloomily
he
been
here
some
time
six
weeks
at
the
least
guess
he
didn
come
into
these
parts
to
look
at
the
prospect
if
he
has
been
working
among
us
all
that
time
with
the
railroad
money
at
his
back
should
expect
that
he
has
got
results
and
that
he
has
passed
them
on
there
not
weak
man
in
the
lodge
cried
mcGinty
true
as
steel
every
man
of
them
and
yet
by
the
lord
there
is
that
skunk
morris
what
about
him
if
any
man
gives
us
away
it
would
be
he
ve
mind
to
send
couple
of
the
boys
round
before
evening
to
give
him
beating
up
and
see
what
they
can
get
from
him
well
there
would
be
no
harm
in
that
mcMurdo
answered
won
deny
that
have
liking
for
morris
and
would
be
sorry
to
see
him
come
to
harm
he
has
spoken
to
me
once
or
twice
over
lodge
matters
and
though
he
may
not
see
them
the
same
as
you
or
he
never
seemed
the
sort
that
squeals
but
still
it
is
not
for
me
to
stand
between
him
and
you
ll
fix
the
old
devil
said
mcGinty
with
an
oath
ve
had
my
eye
on
him
this
year
past
well
you
know
best
about
that
mcMurdo
answered
but
whatever
you
do
must
be
to
morrow
for
we
must
lie
low
until
the
pinkerton
affair
is
settled
up
we
can
afford
to
set
the
police
buzzing
to
day
of
all
days
true
for
you
said
mcGinty
and
we
ll
learn
from
birdy
edwards
himself
where
he
got
his
news
if
we
have
to
cut
his
heart
out
first
did
he
seem
to
scent
trap
mcMurdo
laughed
guess
took
him
on
his
weak
point
he
said
if
he
could
get
on
good
trail
of
the
scowrers
he
ready
to
follow
it
into
hell
took
his
money
mcMurdo
grinned
as
he
produced
wad
of
dollar
notes
and
as
much
more
when
he
has
seen
all
my
papers
what
papers
well
there
are
no
papers
but
filled
him
up
about
constitutions
and
books
of
rules
and
forms
of
membership
he
expects
to
get
right
down
to
the
end
of
everything
before
he
leaves
faith
he
right
there
said
mcGinty
grimly
didn
he
ask
you
why
you
didn
bring
him
the
papers
as
if
would
carry
such
things
and
me
suspected
man
and
captain
marvin
after
speaking
to
me
this
very
day
at
the
depot
ay
heard
of
that
said
mcGinty
guess
the
heavy
end
of
this
business
is
coming
on
to
you
we
could
put
him
down
an
old
shaft
when
we
ve
done
with
him
but
however
we
work
it
we
can
get
past
the
man
living
at
hobson
patch
and
you
being
there
to
day
mcMurdo
shrugged
his
shoulders
if
we
handle
it
right
they
can
never
prove
the
killing
said
he
no
one
can
see
him
come
to
the
house
after
dark
and
ll
lay
to
it
that
no
one
will
see
him
go
now
see
here
councillor
ll
show
you
my
plan
and
ll
ask
you
to
fit
the
others
into
it
you
will
all
come
in
good
time
very
well
he
comes
at
ten
he
is
to
tap
three
times
and
me
to
open
the
door
for
him
then
ll
get
behind
him
and
shut
it
he
our
man
then
that
all
easy
and
plain
yes
but
the
next
step
wants
considering
he
hard
proposition
he
heavily
armed
ve
fooled
him
proper
and
yet
he
is
likely
to
be
on
his
guard
suppose
show
him
right
into
room
with
seven
men
in
it
where
he
expected
to
find
me
alone
there
is
going
to
be
shooting
and
somebody
is
going
to
be
hurt
that
so
and
the
noise
is
going
to
bring
every
damned
copper
in
the
township
on
top
of
it
guess
you
are
right
this
is
how
should
work
it
you
will
all
be
in
the
big
room
same
as
you
saw
when
you
had
chat
with
me
ll
open
the
door
for
him
show
him
into
the
parlour
beside
the
door
and
leave
him
there
while
get
the
papers
that
will
give
me
the
chance
of
telling
you
how
things
are
shaping
then
will
go
back
to
him
with
some
faked
papers
as
he
is
reading
them
will
jump
for
him
and
get
my
grip
on
his
pistol
arm
you
ll
hear
me
call
and
in
you
will
rush
the
quicker
the
better
for
he
is
as
strong
man
as
and
may
have
more
than
can
manage
but
allow
that
can
hold
him
till
you
come
it
good
plan
said
mcGinty
the
lodge
will
owe
you
debt
for
this
guess
when
move
out
of
the
chair
can
put
name
to
the
man
that
coming
after
me
sure
councillor
am
little
more
than
recruit
said
mcMurdo
but
his
face
showed
what
he
thought
of
the
great
man
compliment
when
he
had
returned
home
he
made
his
own
preparations
for
the
grim
evening
in
front
of
him
first
he
cleaned
oiled
and
loaded
his
smith
wesson
revolver
then
he
surveyed
the
room
in
which
the
detective
was
to
be
trapped
it
was
large
apartment
with
long
deal
table
in
the
centre
and
the
big
stove
at
one
side
at
each
of
the
other
sides
were
windows
there
were
no
shutters
on
these
only
light
curtains
which
drew
across
mcMurdo
examined
these
attentively
no
doubt
it
must
have
struck
him
that
the
apartment
was
very
exposed
for
so
secret
meeting
yet
its
distance
from
the
road
made
it
of
less
consequence
finally
he
discussed
the
matter
with
his
fellow
lodger
scanlan
though
scowrer
was
an
inoffensive
little
man
who
was
too
weak
to
stand
against
the
opinion
of
his
comrades
but
was
secretly
horrified
by
the
deeds
of
blood
at
which
he
had
sometimes
been
forced
to
assist
mcMurdo
told
him
shortly
what
was
intended

and
if
were
you
mike
scanlan
would
take
night
off
and
keep
clear
of
it
there
will
be
bloody
work
here
before
morning
well
indeed
then
mac
scanlan
answered
it
not
the
will
but
the
nerve
that
is
wanting
in
me
when
saw
manager
dunn
go
down
at
the
colliery
yonder
it
was
just
more
than
could
stand
not
made
for
it
same
as
you
or
mcGinty
if
the
lodge
will
think
none
the
worse
of
me
ll
just
do
as
you
advise
and
leave
you
to
yourselves
for
the
evening
the
men
came
in
good
time
as
arranged
they
were
outwardly
respectable
citizens
well
clad
and
cleanly
but
judge
of
faces
would
have
read
little
hope
for
birdy
edwards
in
those
hard
mouths
and
remorseless
eyes
there
was
not
man
in
the
room
whose
hands
had
not
been
reddened
dozen
times
before
they
were
as
hardened
to
human
murder
as
butcher
to
sheep
foremost
of
course
both
in
appearance
and
in
guilt
was
the
formidable
boss
harraway
the
secretary
was
lean
bitter
man
with
long
scraggy
neck
and
nervous
jerky
limbs
man
of
incorruptible
fidelity
where
the
finances
of
the
order
were
concerned
and
with
no
notion
of
justice
or
honesty
to
anyone
beyond
the
treasurer
carter
was
middle
aged
man
with
an
impassive
rather
sulky
expression
and
yellow
parchment
skin
he
was
capable
organizer
and
the
actual
details
of
nearly
every
outrage
had
sprung
from
his
plotting
brain
the
two
willabys
were
men
of
action
tall
lithe
young
fellows
with
determined
faces
while
their
companion
tiger
cormac
heavy
dark
youth
was
feared
even
by
his
own
comrades
for
the
ferocity
of
his
disposition
these
were
the
men
who
assembled
that
night
under
the
roof
of
mcMurdo
for
the
killing
of
the
pinkerton
detective
their
host
had
placed
whisky
upon
the
table
and
they
had
hastened
to
prime
themselves
for
the
work
before
them
baldwin
and
cormac
were
already
half
drunk
and
the
liquor
had
brought
out
all
their
ferocity
cormac
placed
his
hands
on
the
stove
for
an
instant
it
had
been
lighted
for
the
nights
were
still
cold
that
will
do
said
he
with
an
oath
ay
said
baldwin
catching
his
meaning
if
he
is
strapped
to
that
we
will
have
the
truth
out
of
him
we
ll
have
the
truth
out
of
him
never
fear
said
mcMurdo
he
had
nerves
of
steel
this
man
for
though
the
whole
weight
of
the
affair
was
on
him
his
manner
was
as
cool
and
unconcerned
as
ever
the
others
marked
it
and
applauded
you
are
the
one
to
handle
him
said
the
boss
approvingly
not
warning
will
he
get
till
your
hand
is
on
his
throat
it
pity
there
are
no
shutters
to
your
windows
mcMurdo
went
from
one
to
the
other
and
drew
the
curtains
tighter
sure
no
one
can
spy
upon
us
now
it
close
upon
the
hour
maybe
he
won
come
maybe
he
ll
get
sniff
of
danger
said
the
secretary
he
ll
come
never
fear
mcMurdo
answered
he
is
as
eager
to
come
as
you
can
be
to
see
him
hark
to
that
they
all
sat
like
wax
figures
some
with
their
glasses
arrested
halfway
to
their
lips
three
loud
knocks
had
sounded
at
the
door
hush
mcMurdo
raised
his
hand
in
caution
an
exulting
glance
went
round
the
circle
and
hands
were
laid
upon
hidden
weapons
not
sound
for
your
lives
mcMurdo
whispered
as
he
went
from
the
room
closing
the
door
carefully
behind
him
with
strained
ears
the
murderers
waited
they
counted
the
steps
of
their
comrade
down
the
passage
then
they
heard
him
open
the
outer
door
there
were
few
words
as
of
greeting
then
they
were
aware
of
strange
step
inside
and
of
an
unfamiliar
voice
an
instant
later
came
the
slam
of
the
door
and
the
turning
of
the
key
in
the
lock
their
prey
was
safe
within
the
trap
tiger
cormac
laughed
horribly
and
boss
mcGinty
clapped
his
great
hand
across
his
mouth
be
quiet
you
fool
he
whispered
you
ll
be
the
undoing
of
us
yet
there
was
mutter
of
conversation
from
the
next
room
it
seemed
interminable
then
the
door
opened
and
mcMurdo
appeared
his
finger
upon
his
lip
he
came
to
the
end
of
the
table
and
looked
round
at
them
subtle
change
had
come
over
him
his
manner
was
as
of
one
who
has
great
work
to
do
his
face
had
set
into
granite
firmness
his
eyes
shone
with
fierce
excitement
behind
his
spectacles
he
had
become
visible
leader
of
men
they
stared
at
him
with
eager
interest
but
he
said
nothing
still
with
the
same
singular
gaze
he
looked
from
man
to
man
well
cried
boss
mcGinty
at
last
is
he
here
is
birdy
edwards
here
yes
mcMurdo
answered
slowly
birdy
edwards
is
here
am
birdy
edwards
there
were
ten
seconds
after
that
brief
speech
during
which
the
room
might
have
been
empty
so
profound
was
the
silence
the
hissing
of
kettle
upon
the
stove
rose
sharp
and
strident
to
the
ear
seven
white
faces
all
turned
upward
to
this
man
who
dominated
them
were
set
motionless
with
utter
terror
then
with
sudden
shivering
of
glass
bristle
of
glistening
rifle
barrels
broke
through
each
window
while
the
curtains
were
torn
from
their
hangings
at
the
sight
boss
mcGinty
gave
the
roar
of
wounded
bear
and
plunged
for
the
half
opened
door
levelled
revolver
met
him
there
with
the
stern
blue
eyes
of
captain
marvin
of
the
coal
and
iron
police
gleaming
behind
the
sights
the
boss
recoiled
and
fell
back
into
his
chair
you
re
safer
there
councillor
said
the
man
whom
they
had
known
as
mcMurdo
and
you
baldwin
if
you
don
take
your
hand
off
your
pistol
you
ll
cheat
the
hangman
yet
pull
it
out
or
by
the
lord
that
made
me
there
that
will
do
there
are
forty
armed
men
round
this
house
and
you
can
figure
it
out
for
yourself
what
chance
you
have
take
their
pistols
marvin
there
was
no
possible
resistance
under
the
menace
of
those
rifles
the
men
were
disarmed
sulky
sheepish
and
amazed
they
still
sat
round
the
table
like
to
say
word
to
you
before
we
separate
said
the
man
who
had
trapped
them
guess
we
may
not
meet
again
until
you
see
me
on
the
stand
in
the
courthouse
ll
give
you
something
to
think
over
between
now
and
then
you
know
me
now
for
what
am
at
last
can
put
my
cards
on
the
table
am
birdy
edwards
of
pinkerton
was
chosen
to
break
up
your
gang
had
hard
and
dangerous
game
to
play
not
soul
not
one
soul
not
my
nearest
and
dearest
knew
that
was
playing
it
only
captain
marvin
here
and
my
employers
knew
that
but
it
over
to
night
thank
god
and
am
the
winner
the
seven
pale
rigid
faces
looked
up
at
him
there
was
unappeasable
hatred
in
their
eyes
he
read
the
relentless
threat
maybe
you
think
that
the
game
is
not
over
yet
well
take
my
chance
of
that
anyhow
some
of
you
will
take
no
further
hand
and
there
are
sixty
more
besides
yourselves
that
will
see
jail
this
night
ll
tell
you
this
that
when
was
put
upon
this
job
never
believed
there
was
such
society
as
yours
thought
it
was
paper
talk
and
that
would
prove
it
so
they
told
me
it
was
to
do
with
the
freemen
so
went
to
chicago
and
was
made
one
then
was
surer
than
ever
that
it
was
just
paper
talk
for
found
no
harm
in
the
society
but
deal
of
good
still
had
to
carry
out
my
job
and
came
to
the
coal
valleys
when
reached
this
place
learned
that
was
wrong
and
that
it
wasn
dime
novel
after
all
so
stayed
to
look
after
it
never
killed
man
in
chicago
never
minted
dollar
in
my
life
those
gave
you
were
as
good
as
any
others
but
never
spent
money
better
but
knew
the
way
into
your
good
wishes
and
so
pretended
to
you
that
the
law
was
after
me
it
all
worked
just
as
thought
so
joined
your
infernal
lodge
and
took
my
share
in
your
councils
maybe
they
will
say
that
was
as
bad
as
you
they
can
say
what
they
like
so
long
as
get
you
but
what
is
the
truth
the
night
joined
you
beat
up
old
man
stanger
could
not
warn
him
for
there
was
no
time
but
held
your
hand
baldwin
when
you
would
have
killed
him
if
ever
have
suggested
things
so
as
to
keep
my
place
among
you
they
were
things
which
knew
could
prevent
could
not
save
dunn
and
menzies
for
did
not
know
enough
but
will
see
that
their
murderers
are
hanged
gave
chester
wilcox
warning
so
that
when
blew
his
house
in
he
and
his
folk
were
in
hiding
there
was
many
crime
that
could
not
stop
but
if
you
look
back
and
think
how
often
your
man
came
home
the
other
road
or
was
down
in
town
when
you
went
for
him
or
stayed
indoors
when
you
thought
he
would
come
out
you
ll
see
my
work
you
blasted
traitor
hissed
mcGinty
through
his
closed
teeth
ay
john
mcGinty
you
may
call
me
that
if
it
eases
your
smart
you
and
your
like
have
been
the
enemy
of
god
and
man
in
these
parts
it
took
man
to
get
between
you
and
the
poor
devils
of
men
and
women
that
you
held
under
your
grip
there
was
just
one
way
of
doing
it
and
did
it
you
call
me
traitor
but
guess
there
many
thousand
will
call
me
deliverer
that
went
down
into
hell
to
save
them
ve
had
three
months
of
it
wouldn
have
three
such
months
again
if
they
let
me
loose
in
the
treasury
at
washington
for
it
had
to
stay
till
had
it
all
every
man
and
every
secret
right
here
in
this
hand
have
waited
little
longer
if
it
hadn
come
to
my
knowledge
that
my
secret
was
coming
out
letter
had
come
into
the
town
that
would
have
set
you
wise
to
it
all

to

to
tell
scanlan
had
been
given
sealed
note
to
be
left
at
the
address
of
miss
ettie
shafter
mission
which
he
had
accepted
with
wink
and
knowing
smile
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
beautiful
woman
and
much
muffled
man
boarded
special
train
which
had
been
sent
by
the
railroad
company
and
made
swift
unbroken
journey
out
of
the
land
of
danger
it
was
the
last
time
that
ever
either
ettie
or
her
lover
set
foot
in
the
valley
of
fear
ten
days
later
they
were
married
in
chicago
with
old
jacob
shafter
as
witness
of
the
wedding
the
trial
of
the
scowrers
was
held
far
from
the
place
where
their
adherents
might
have
terrified
the
guardians
of
the
law
in
vain
they
struggled
in
vain
the
money
of
the
lodge
money
squeezed
by
blackmail
out
of
the
whole
countryside
was
spent
like
water
in
the
attempt
to
save
them
that
cold
clear
unimpassioned
statement
from
one
who
knew
every
detail
of
their
lives
their
organization
and
their
crimes
was
unshaken
by
all
the
wiles
of
their
defenders
at
last
after
so
many
years
they
were
broken
and
scattered
the
cloud
was
lifted
forever
from
the
valley
mcGinty
met
his
fate
upon
the
scaffold
cringing
and
whining
when
the
last
hour
came
eight
of
his
chief
followers
shared
his
fate
fifty
odd
had
various
degrees
of
imprisonment
the
work
of
birdy
edwards
was
complete
and
yet
as
he
had
guessed
the
game
was
not
over
yet
there
was
another
hand
to
be
played
and
yet
another
and
another
ted
baldwin
for
one
had
escaped
the
scaffold
so
had
the
willabys
so
had
several
others
of
the
fiercest
spirits
of
the
gang
for
ten
years
they
were
out
of
the
world
and
then
came
day
when
they
were
free
once
more
day
which
edwards
who
knew
his
men
was
very
sure
would
be
an
end
of
his
life
of
peace
they
had
sworn
an
oath
on
all
that
they
thought
holy
to
have
his
blood
as
vengeance
for
their
comrades
and
well
they
strove
to
keep
their
vow
from
chicago
he
was
chased
after
two
attempts
so
near
success
that
it
was
sure
that
the
third
would
get
him
from
chicago
he
went
under
changed
name
to
california
and
it
was
there
that
the
light
went
for
time
out
of
his
life
when
ettie
edwards
died
once
again
he
was
nearly
killed
and
once
again
under
the
name
of
douglas
he
worked
in
lonely
canyon
where
with
an
english
partner
named
barker
he
amassed
fortune
at
last
there
came
warning
to
him
that
the
bloodhounds
were
on
his
track
once
more
and
he
cleared
only
just
in
time
for
england
and
thence
came
the
john
douglas
who
for
second
time
married
worthy
mate
and
lived
for
five
years
as
sussex
county
gentleman
life
which
ended
with
the
strange
happenings
of
which
we
have
heard
epilogue
the
police
trial
had
passed
in
which
the
case
of
john
douglas
was
referred
to
higher
court
so
had
the
quarter
sessions
at
which
he
was
acquitted
as
having
acted
in
self
defense
get
him
out
of
england
at
any
cost
wrote
holmes
to
the
wife
there
are
forces
here
which
may
be
more
dangerous
than
those
he
has
escaped
there
is
no
safety
for
your
husband
in
england
two
months
had
gone
by
and
the
case
had
to
some
extent
passed
from
our
minds
then
one
morning
there
came
an
enigmatic
note
slipped
into
our
letter
box
dear
me
mr
holmes
dear
me
said
this
singular
epistle
there
was
neither
superscription
nor
signature
laughed
at
the
quaint
message
but
holmes
showed
unwonted
seriousness
devilry
watson
he
remarked
and
sat
long
with
clouded
brow
late
last
night
mrs
hudson
our
landlady
brought
up
message
that
gentleman
wished
to
see
holmes
and
that
the
matter
was
of
the
utmost
importance
close
at
the
heels
of
his
messenger
came
cecil
barker
our
friend
of
the
moated
manor
house
his
face
was
drawn
and
haggard
ve
had
bad
news
terrible
news
mr
holmes
said
he
feared
as
much
said
holmes

not
had
cable

had
note
from
someone
who

it
poor

jack

it
came

it
said

thoughtfully
well
ve
no
doubt
it
was
well
stage
managed
you
mean
that
you
think
there
was
no
accident
none
in
the
world
he
was
murdered
surely
so
think
also
these
infernal
scowrers
this
cursed
vindictive
nest
of
criminals
no
my
good
sir
said
holmes
there
is
master

here
it
is
no

of

clumsy

shooters
you
can
tell
an
old
master
by
the
sweep
of
his
brush
can
tell
moriarty
when
see
one
this
crime
is
from
london
not
from
america
but
for
what
motive
because
it
is
done
by
man
who
cannot
afford
to
fail
one
whose
whole
unique
position
depends
upon
the
fact
that
all
he
does
must
succeed
great
brain
and
huge
organization
have
been
turned
to
the
extinction
of
one
man
it
is
crushing
the
nut
with
the
hammer
an
absurd
extravagance
of
energy
but
the
nut
is
very
effectually
crushed
all
the
same
how
came
this
man
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
can
only
say
that
the
first
word
that
ever
came
to
us
of
the
business
was
from
one
of
his
lieutenants
these
americans
were
well
advised
having
an
english
job
to
do
they
took
into
partnership
as
any
foreign
criminal
could
do
this
great
consultant
in
crime
from
that
moment
their
man
was
doomed
at
first
he
would
content
himself
by
using
his
machinery
in
order
to
find
their
victim
then
he
would
indicate
how
the
matter
might
be
treated
finally
when
he
read
in
the
reports
of
the
failure
of
this
agent
he
would
step
in
himself
with
master
touch
you
heard
me
warn
this
man
at
birlstone
manor
house
that
the
coming
danger
was
greater
than
the
past
was
right
barker
beat
his
head
with
his
clenched
fist
in
his
impotent
anger
do
you
tell
me
that
we
have
to
sit
down
under
this
do
you
say
that
no
one
can
ever
get
level
with
this
king
devil
no
don
say
that
said
holmes
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
looking
far
into
the
future
don
say
that
he
can
be
beat
but
you
must
give
me
time
you
must
give
me
time
we
all
sat
in
silence
for
some
minutes
while
those
fateful
eyes
still
strained

in

to
sherlock
holmes
she
is
always
the
woman
have
seldom
heard
him
mention
her
under
any
other
name
in
his
eyes
she
eclipses
and
predominates
the
whole
of
her
sex
it
was
not
that
he
felt
any
emotion
akin
to
love
for
irene
adler
all
emotions
and
that
one
particularly
were
abhorrent
to
his
cold
precise
but
admirably
balanced
mind
he
was
take
it
the
most
perfect
reasoning
and
observing
machine
that
the
world
has
seen
but
as
lover
he
would
have
placed
himself
in
false
position
he
never
spoke
of
the
softer
passions
save
with
gibe
and
sneer
they
were
admirable
things
for
the
observer
excellent
for
drawing
the
veil
from
men’s
motives
and
actions
but
for
the
trained
reasoner
to
admit
such
intrusions
into
his
own
delicate
and
finely
adjusted
temperament
was
to
introduce
distracting
factor
which
might
throw
doubt
upon
all
his
mental
results
grit
in
sensitive
instrument
or
crack
in
one
of
his
own
high
power
lenses
would
not
be
more
disturbing
than
strong
emotion
in
nature
such
as
his
and
yet
there
was
but
one
woman
to
him
and
that
woman
was
the
late
irene
adler
of
dubious
and
questionable
memory
had
seen
little
of
holmes
lately
my
marriage
had
drifted
us
away
from
each
other
my
own
complete
happiness
and
the
home
centred
interests
which
rise
up
around
the
man
who
first
finds
himself
master
of
his
own
establishment
were
sufficient
to
absorb
all
my
attention
while
holmes
who
loathed
every
form
of
society
with
his
whole
bohemian
soul
remained
in
our
lodgings
in
baker
street
buried
among
his
old
books
and
alternating
from
week
to
week
between
cocaine
and
ambition
the
drowsiness
of
the
drug
and
the
fierce
energy
of
his
own
keen
nature
he
was
still
as
ever
deeply
attracted
by
the
study
of
crime
and
occupied
his
immense
faculties
and
extraordinary
powers
of
observation
in
following
out
those
clues
and
clearing
up
those
mysteries
which
had
been
abandoned
as
hopeless
by
the
official
police
from
time
to
time
heard
some
vague
account
of
his
doings
of
his
summons
to
odessa
in
the
case
of
the
trepoff
murder
of
his
clearing
up
of
the
singular
tragedy
of
the
atkinson
brothers
at
trincomalee
and
finally
of
the
mission
which
he
had
accomplished
so
delicately
and
successfully
for
the
reigning
family
of
holland
beyond
these
signs
of
his
activity

which
merely

one
night
it
was
on
the
twentieth
of
march
1888—I
was
returning
from
journey
to
patient
for
had
now
returned
to
civil
practice
when
my
way
led
me
through
baker
street
as
passed
the
well
remembered
door
which
must
always
be
associated
in
my
mind
with
my
wooing
and
with
the
dark
incidents
of
the
study
in
scarlet
was
seized
with
keen
desire
to
see
holmes
again
and
to
know
how
he
was
employing
his
extraordinary
powers
his
rooms
were
brilliantly
lit
and
even
as
looked
up
saw
his
tall
spare
figure
pass
twice
in
dark
silhouette
against
the
blind
he
was
pacing
the
room
swiftly
eagerly
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
chest
and
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
to
me
who
knew
his
every
mood
and
habit
his
attitude
and
manner
told
their
own
story
he
was
at
work
again
he
had
risen
out
of
his
drug
created
dreams
and
was
hot
upon
the
scent
of
some
new
problem
rang
the
bell
and
was
shown
up
to
the
chamber
which
had
formerly
been
in
part
my
own
his
manner
was
not
effusive
it
seldom
was
but
he
was
glad
think
to
see
me
with
hardly
word
spoken
but
with
kindly
eye
he
waved
me
to
an
armchair
threw
across
his
case
of
cigars
and
indicated
spirit
case
and
gasogene
in
the
corner
then
he
stood
before
the
fire
and
looked
me
over
in
his
singular
introspective
fashion
“Wedlock
suits
you
he
remarked
“I
think
watson
that
you
have
put
on
seven
and
half
pounds
since
saw
you
“Seven
answered
“Indeed
should
have
thought
little
more
just
trifle
more
fancy
watson
and
in
practice
again
observe
you
did
not
tell
me
that
you
intended
to
go
into
harness
“Then
how
do
you
know
“I
see
it
deduce
it
how
do
know
that
you
have
been
getting
yourself
very
wet
lately
and
that
you
have
most
clumsy
and
careless
servant
girl
“My
dear
holmes
said
“this
is
too
much
you
would
certainly
have
been
burned
had
you
lived
few
centuries
ago
it
is
true
that
had
country
walk
on
thursday
and
came
home
in
dreadful
mess
but
as
have
changed
my
clothes
can’t
imagine
how
you
deduce
it
as
to
mary
jane
she
is
incorrigible
and
my
wife
has
given
her
notice
but
there
again
fail
to
see
how
you
work
it
out
he
chuckled
to
himself
and
rubbed
his
long
nervous
hands
together
“It
is
simplicity
itself
said
he
“my
eyes
tell
me
that
on
the
inside
of
your
left
shoe
just
where
the
firelight
strikes
it
the
leather
is
scored
by
six
almost
parallel
cuts
obviously
they
have
been
caused
by
someone
who
has
very
carelessly
scraped
round
the
edges
of
the
sole
in
order
to
remove
crusted
mud
from
it
hence
you
see
my
double
deduction
that
you
had
been
out
in
vile
weather
and
that
you
had
particularly
malignant
boot
slitting
specimen
of
the
london
slavey
as
to
your
practice
if
gentleman
walks
into
my
rooms
smelling
of
iodoform
with
black
mark
of
nitrate
of
silver
upon
his
right
forefinger
and
bulge
on
the
right
side
of
his
top
hat
to
show
where
he
has
secreted
his
stethoscope
must
be
dull
indeed
if
do
not
pronounce
him
to
be
an
active
member
of
the
medical
profession
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
ease
with
which
he
explained
his
process
of
deduction
“When
hear
you
give
your
reasons
remarked
“the
thing
always
appears
to
me
to
be
so
ridiculously
simple
that
could
easily
do
it
myself
though
at
each
successive
instance
of
your
reasoning
am
baffled
until
you
explain
your
process
and
yet
believe
that
my
eyes
are
as
good
as
yours
“Quite
so
he
answered
lighting
cigarette
and
throwing
himself
down
into
an
armchair
“You
see
but
you
do
not
observe
the
distinction
is
clear
for
example
you
have
frequently
seen
the
steps
which
lead
up
from
the
hall
to
this
room
“Frequently
“How
often
“Well
some
hundreds
of
times
“Then
how
many
are
there
“How
many
don’t
know
“Quite
so
you
have
not
observed
and
yet
you
have
seen
that
is
just
my
point
now
know
that
there
are
seventeen
steps
because
have
both
seen
and
observed
by
the
way
since
you
are
interested
in
these
little
problems
and
since
you
are
good
enough
to
chronicle
one
or
two
of
my
trifling
experiences
you
may
be
interested
in
this
he
threw
over
sheet
of
thick
pink
tinted
notepaper
which
had
been
lying
open
upon
the
table
“It
came
by
the
last
post
said
he
“Read
it
aloud
the
note
was
undated
and
without
either
signature
or
address
“There
will
call
upon
you
to
night
at
quarter
to
eight
o’clock
it
said
“a
gentleman
who
desires
to
consult
you
upon
matter
of
the
very
deepest
moment
your
recent
services
to
one
of
the
royal
houses
of
europe
have
shown
that
you
are
one
who
may
safely
be
trusted
with
matters
which
are
of
an
importance
which
can
hardly
be
exaggerated
this
account
of
you
we
have
from
all
quarters
received

in

then
at
that
hour
and
do
not
take
it
amiss

is
indeed

“What
do
you
imagine
that
it

instead
of

but
the
note
itself
what
do
you
deduce
from
it
carefully
examined
the
writing
and
the
paper
upon
which
it
was
written
“The
man
who
wrote
it
was
presumably
well
to
do
remarked
endeavouring
to
imitate
my
companion’s
processes
“Such
paper
could
not
be
bought
under
half
crown
packet
it
is
peculiarly
strong
and
stiff
“Peculiar
that
is
the
very
word
said
holmes
“It
is
not

all
hold
it

did
so
and
saw
large
“E”
with

into
the

“What

holmes
“The

his

“Not

sparkled

he
sent
up

from
his

“The

“Precisely

the

remains
therefore
to
discover
what

wanted
by
this
german
who
writes

prefers
wearing

to

here
he
comes

the

have
an
influence
upon
european
history
“I
promise
said
holmes
“And
“You
will
excuse
this
mask
continued
our
strange
visitor
“The
august
person
who
employs
me
wishes
his
agent
to
be
unknown
to
you
and
may
confess
at
once
that
the
title
by
which
have
just
called
myself
is
not
exactly
my
own
“I
was
aware
of
it
said
holmes
dryly
“The
circumstances
are
of
great
delicacy
and
every
precaution
has
to
be
taken
to
quench
what
might
grow
to
be
an
immense
scandal
and
seriously
compromise
one
of
the
reigning
families
of
europe
to
speak
plainly
the
matter
implicates
the
great
house
of
ormstein

kings
of
bohemia
“I
was
also
aware
of
that
murmured
holmes
settling
himself
down
in
his
armchair
and
closing
his
eyes
our
visitor
glanced
with
some
apparent
surprise
at
the
languid
lounging
figure
of
the
man
who
had
been
no
doubt
depicted
to
him
as
the
most
incisive
reasoner
and
most
energetic
agent
in
europe
holmes
slowly
reopened
his
eyes
and
looked
impatiently
at
his
gigantic
client
“If
your
majesty
would
condescend
to
state
your
case
he
remarked
“I
should
be
better
able
to
advise
you
the
man
sprang
from
his
chair
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
in
uncontrollable
agitation
then
with
gesture
of
desperation
he
tore
the
mask
from
his
face
and
hurled
it
upon
the
ground
“You
are
right
he
cried
“I
am
the
king
why
should
attempt
to
conceal
it
“Why
indeed
murmured
holmes
“Your
majesty
had
not
spoken
before
was
aware
that
was
addressing
wilhelm
gottsreich
sigismond
von
ormstein
grand
duke
of
cassel
felstein
and
hereditary
king
of
bohemia
“But
you
can
understand
said
our
strange
visitor
sitting
down
once
more
and
passing
his
hand
over
his
high
white
forehead
“you
can
understand
that
am
not
accustomed
to
doing
such
business
in
my
own
person
yet
the
matter
was
so
delicate
that
could
not
confide
it
to
an
agent

putting
myself
in
his
power

come
incognito
from
prague
for
the
purpose
of
consulting
you
“Then
pray

holmes
shutting
his
eyes
once
more
“The
facts
are
briefly
these

five
years

the

“Kindly
look

up

murmured
holmes
without
opening
his
eyes
for
many
years
he
had
adopted
system
of
docketing
all
paragraphs
concerning
men
and
things
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
name

on
which
he
could
not
at

in
between

laughed

he
“But

the

reproachfully
“Very
indeed

what

she
propose
to
do
with

“To

“But
how
“I

“Threatens

the

she
will
do
it

do

you

she
has
soul

she
has
the
face
of
the
most
beautiful
of

the
mind
of
the
most
resolute
of

rather
than

another

there
are
no

she
would
not

none
“You
are
sure
that
she
has
not

“I
am
sure

why
“Because
she

said
that
she

was
publicly
proclaimed
that

“Oh
then
we
have
three

holmes
with
yawn
“That
is
very
fortunate
as

one

two

tell

one

the
provinces

“And
for
present
expenses
the
king
took
heavy
chamois
leather
bag
from
under
his
cloak
and
laid
it
on
the
table
“There
are
three
hundred
pounds
in
gold

seven
hundred

notes
he
said
holmes
scribbled
receipt
upon
sheet
of
his
note
book
and
handed
it
to
him
“And
mademoiselle’s
address
he
asked
“Is

added
as

royal

rolled
down

with

already
deeply
interested

it
was
surrounded
by
none

grim
and
strange
features

were
associated
with
the
two
crimes

have
already

still
the
nature

the

the
exalted

it
character
of
its
own
indeed
apart
from
the
nature
of
the
investigation
which
my
friend
had
on
hand
there
was
something
in
his
masterly
grasp
of
situation
and
his
keen
incisive
reasoning
which
made
it
pleasure
to
me
to
study
his
system
of
work
and
to
follow
the
quick
subtle
methods
by
which
he
disentangled
the
most
inextricable
mysteries

his
invariable
success

the

his
failing

respectable
as
of

his

into

he
stretched
out
his
legs
in

of
the
fire
and
laughed
heartily
for
some
minutes
“Well
really
he
cried
and
then
he
choked
and
laughed
again
until
he
was
obliged
to
lie
back
limp
and
helpless
in
the
chair

is
it
“It’s
quite
too
funny

sure
you
could
never

how
employed
my
morning

o’clock

without

to
walk
up
and
down
near
briony

once
more

to

over
my
plan

“This
godfrey

was
evidently
an
important
factor
in
the
matter
he
was

sounded
ominous
what
was
the
relation

what
the
object
of
his
repeated
visits
was
she
his
client
his
friend

his
mistress

the
former
she
had
probably
transferred
the
photograph
to
his
keeping
if
the
latter
it
was
less
likely
on
the
issue
of
this
question
depended
whether
should
continue
my
work
at
briony

or
turn
my
attention
to
the
gentleman’s
chambers
in
the

was
delicate
point
and
it
widened
the
field
of
my
inquiry

bore
you
with
these
details

have
to
let
you
see
my
little
difficulties

you
are
to

situation
“I
am

“I
was
still
balancing
the
matter

my
mind

drove
up

sprang
out
he
was
remarkably
handsome
man
dark
aquiline
and
moustached
evidently
the
man
of
whom
had
heard
he
appeared
to
be
in
great
hurry
shouted
to
the
cabman
to
wait
and
brushed
past
the
maid
who
opened
the
door
with
the
air
of
man
who
was
thoroughly
at
home
“He
was
in
the
house
about
half
an
hour
and
could
catch
glimpses
of
him
in
the
windows
of
the
sitting
room
pacing
up
and
down
talking
excitedly
and
waving
his
arms

her

presently
he
emerged
looking
even
more
flurried
than
before
as
he
stepped
up
to
the
cab
he
pulled
gold
watch
from
his
pocket
and
looked
at
it
earnestly
‘Drive

then
to

you
do

“Away
they
went

was
just
wondering
whether
should
not
do
well
to
follow
them
when
up
the
lane
came
neat
little
landau
the
coachman
with
his
coat
only
half
buttoned
and
his
tie
under
his
ear

all
the

were
sticking
out

buckles
it
hadn’t
pulled
up
before
she
shot
out
of
the

door
and
into
it
only
caught
glimpse
of
her
at
the
moment
but
she
was
lovely
woman
with
face
that
man
might
die
for
‘The

cried

half
sovereign

was
quite
too
good
to

watson
was
just
balancing
whether
should
run
for
it
or
whether
should
perch
behind
her
landau
when
cab
came
through
the
street
the
driver
looked
twice
at
such
shabby
fare
but
jumped
in
before
he
could
object
‘The
church

st

said
‘and
half
sovereign
if
you
reach
it
in
twenty

it
was
twenty
five
minutes
to
twelve
and
of
course
it
was
clear
enough
what
was
in
the
wind
“My
cabby
drove
fast
don’t
think
ever
drove
faster
but
the
others
were
there
before
us
the
cab
and
the
landau
with
their
steaming
horses
were
in
front
of
the
door
when
arrived
paid
the
man
and
hurried
into
the
church
there
was
not
soul
there
save
the
two
whom
had
followed
and
surpliced
clergyman
who
seemed
to
be
expostulating
with
them
they
were
all
three
standing
in
knot
in
front
of
the
altar
lounged
up
the
side
aisle
like
any
other
idler
who
has
dropped
into
church
suddenly
to
my
surprise
the
three
at
the
altar
faced
round
to
me
and
godfrey
norton
came
running
as
hard
as
he
could
towards
me
‘Thank
god
he
cried
‘You’ll
do
come
‘What
then
asked
‘Come
man
come
only
three
minutes
or
it
won’t
be
legal
“I
was
half
dragged
up
to
the
altar
and
before
knew
where
was
found
myself
mumbling
responses
which
were
whispered
in
my
ear
and
vouching
for
things
of
which
knew
nothing
and
generally
assisting
in
the
secure
tying
up
of
irene
adler
spinster
to
godfrey
norton
bachelor
it
was
all
done
in
an
instant
and
there
was
the
gentleman
thanking
me
on
the
one
side
and
the
lady
on
the
other
while
the
clergyman
beamed
on
me
in
front
it
was
the
most
preposterous
position
in
which
ever
found
myself
in
my
life
and
it
was
the
thought
of
it
that
started
me
laughing
just
now
it
seems
that
there
had
been
some
informality
about
their
license
that
the
clergyman
absolutely
refused
to
marry
them
without
witness
of
some
sort
and
that
my
lucky
appearance
saved
the
bridegroom
from
having
to
sally
out
into
the
streets
in
search
of
best
man
the
bride

to
wear
it
on
my
watch

in
memory
of
the
occasion

unexpected

what
then
“Well
found
my
plans
very
seriously

it
looked
as
if
the
pair
might
take
an
immediate
departure

so
necessitate
very
prompt
and
energetic
measures
on
my
part
at
the
church
door
however
they
separated

driving
back
to
the
temple
and
she
to
her
own
house
‘I
shall
drive
out
in
the
park
at
five
as
usual
she
said
as
she
left
him
heard
no
more
they
drove
away
in
different
directions
and
went
off
to
make
my
own
arrangements
“Which
are
“Some
cold
beef
and
glass
of
beer
he
answered
ringing
the
bell
“I
have
been
too
busy
to

of

am
likely
to
be
busier

shall
be
delighted
“You
don’t

“Not
in

“Not

“Oh
the
cause
is
excellent
“Then
am
your

“I
was
sure
that
might
rely
on
you
“But
what
is
it
you
wish
“When
mrs
turner
has
brought
in
the
tray
will
make
it
clear
to
you

he
said
as
he
turned
hungrily
on
the
simple
fare
that
our
landlady
had
provided
“I
must
discuss
it

eat

“And
what
then
“You
must
leave
that
to
me
have
already
arranged
what
is
to
occur
there
is
only
one
point
on
which
must
insist
you
must
not
interfere
come
what
may
you
understand
“I
am
to
be
neutral
“To
do
nothing
whatever
there
will
probably
be
some
small
unpleasantness

not
join
in

will
end
in
my
being

into
the
house

or
five
minutes
afterwards

“Yes
“And
when
raise
my

you
will
throw
into
the

what
give
you
to
throw

will
at
the

time
raise
the
cry

quite
follow

“Entirely
“It
is
nothing
very
formidable
he
said
taking
long
cigar
shaped
roll
from
his
pocket
“It
is

with

up
by

may
then
walk
to

will
rejoin

have
made
myself
clear
“I
am
to

at
the
signal
to
throw
in
this
object
then
to
raise
the
cry

fire
and
to
wait
you
at
the
corner
of
the
street
“Precisely
“Then
you
may
entirely
rely
on
me
“That
is
excellent

perhaps
it
is
almost
time
that
prepare
for
the
new

to
play
he
disappeared
into
his
bedroom
and
returned
in
few
minutes
in
the
character
of
an
amiable
and
simple
minded
nonconformist
clergyman
his
broad
black
hat
his
baggy
trousers
his
white
tie
his
sympathetic
smile
and
general
look
of
peering
and
benevolent
curiosity
were
such
as
mr
john
hare
alone
could
have
equalled
it
was
not
merely
that
holmes
changed
his
costume
his
expression
his
manner
his
very
soul
seemed
to
vary
with
every
fresh
part
that
he
assumed
the
stage
lost
fine
actor
even
as
science
lost
an
acute
reasoner
when
he
became
specialist
in
crime
it
was
quarter
past
six
when
we
left
baker
street
and
it
still
wanted
ten
minutes
to
the
hour
when
we
found
ourselves
in
serpentine
avenue
it
was
already
dusk
and
the
lamps
were
just
being
lighted
as
we
paced
up
and
down
in
front
of
briony
lodge
waiting
for
the
coming
of
its
occupant
the
house
was
just
such
as
had
pictured
it
from
sherlock
holmes’
succinct
description
but
the
locality
appeared
to
be
less
private
than
expected
on
the
contrary
for
small
street
in
quiet
neighbourhood
it
was
remarkably
animated
there
was
group
of
shabbily
dressed
men
smoking
and
laughing
in
corner
scissors
grinder
with
his
wheel
two
guardsmen
who
were
flirting
with
nurse
girl
and
several
well
dressed
young
men
who
were
lounging
up
and
down
with
cigars
in
their
mouths
“You
see
remarked
holmes
as
we
paced
to
and
fro
in
front
of
the
house
“this
marriage
rather
simplifies
matters
the
photograph
becomes
double
edged
weapon
now
the
chances
are
that
she
would
be
as
averse
to
its
being
seen
by
mr
godfrey
norton
as
our
client
is
to
its
coming
to
the
eyes
of
his
princess
now
the
question
is
where
are
we
to
find
the
photograph
“Where
indeed
“It
is
most
unlikely
that
she
carries
it
about
with
her
it
is
cabinet
size
too
large
for
easy
concealment
about
woman’s
dress
she
knows
that
the
king
is
capable
of
having
her
waylaid
and
searched
two
attempts
of
the
sort
have
already
been
made
we
may
take
it
then
that
she
does
not
carry
it
about
with
her
“Where
then
“Her
banker
or
her
lawyer
there
is
that
double
possibility
but
am
inclined
to
think
neither
women
are
naturally
secretive
and
they
like
to
do
their
own
secreting
why
should
she
hand
it
over
to
anyone
else
she
could
trust
her
own
guardianship
but
she
could
not
tell
what
indirect
or
political
influence
might
be
brought
to
bear
upon
business
man
besides
remember
that
she
had
resolved
to
use
it
within
few
days
it
must
be
where
she
can
lay
her
hands
upon
it
must
be
in
her
own
house
“But
it
has
twice
been
burgled
“Pshaw
they
did
not
know
how
to
look
“But
how
will
you
look
“I
will
not
look
“What
then
“I
will
get
her
to
show
me
“But
she
will
refuse
“She
will
not
be
able
to

hear
the
rumble
of
wheels

is

carry
out
my
orders
to
the
letter
as
he
spoke
the
gleam
of
the
sidelights
of
carriage
came
round
the
curve
of
the
avenue
it
was
smart
little
landau
which
rattled
up
to
the
door
of
briony
lodge
as
it
pulled
up
one
of
the
loafing
men
at
the
corner
dashed
forward
to
open
the
door
in
the
hope
of
earning
copper
but
was
elbowed
away
by
another
loafer
who
had
rushed
up
with
the
same
intention
fierce
quarrel
broke
out
which
was
increased
by
the
two
guardsmen
who
took
sides
with
one
of
the
loungers
and
by
the
scissors
grinder
who
was
equally
hot
upon
the
other
side
blow
was
struck
and
in
an
instant
the
lady
who
had
stepped
from
her
carriage
was
the
centre
of
little
knot
of
flushed
and
struggling
men
who
struck
savagely
at
each
other
with
their
fists
and
sticks
holmes
dashed
into
the
crowd
to
protect
the
lady
but
just
as
he
reached
her
he
gave
cry
and
dropped
to
the
ground
with
the
blood
running
freely
down
his
face
at
his
fall
the
guardsmen
took
to
their
heels
in
one
direction
and
the
loungers
in
the
other
while
number
of
better
dressed
people
who
had
watched
the
scuffle
without
taking
part
in
it
crowded
in
to
help
the
lady
and
to
attend
to
the
injured
man
irene
adler
as
will
still
call
her
had
hurried
up
the
steps
but
she
stood
at
the
top
with
her
superb
figure
outlined
against
the
lights
of
the
hall
looking
back
into
the
street
“Is
the
poor
gentleman
much
hurt
she
asked
“He
is
dead
cried
several
voices
“No
no
there’s
life
in
him
shouted
another
“But
he’ll
be
gone
before
you
can
get
him
to
hospital
“He’s
brave
fellow
said
woman
“They
would
have
had
the
lady’s
purse
and
watch
if
it
hadn’t
been
for
him
they
were
gang
and
rough
one
too
ah
he’s
breathing
now
“He
can’t
lie
in
the
street
may
we
bring
him
in
marm
“Surely
bring
him
into
the
sitting
room
there
is
comfortable
sofa
this
way
please
slowly
and
solemnly
he
was
borne
into
briony
lodge
and
laid
out
in
the
principal
room
while
still
observed
the
proceedings
from
my
post
by
the
window
the
lamps
had
been
lit
but
the
blinds
had
not
been
drawn
so
that
could
see
holmes
as
he
lay
upon
the
couch
do
not
know
whether
he
was
seized
with
compunction
at
that
moment
for
the
part
he
was
playing
but
know
that
never
felt
more
heartily
ashamed
of
myself
in
my
life
than
when
saw
the
beautiful
creature
against
whom
was
conspiring
or
the
grace
and
kindliness
with
which
she
waited
upon
the
injured
man
and
yet
it
would
be
the
blackest
treachery
to
holmes
to
draw
back
now
from
the
part
which
he
had
intrusted
to
me
hardened
my
heart
and
took
the
smoke
rocket
from
under
my
ulster
after
all
thought
we
are
not
injuring
her
we
are
but
preventing
her
from
injuring
another
holmes
had
sat
up
upon
the
couch
and
saw
him
motion
like
man
who
is
in
need
of
air
maid
rushed
across
and
threw
open
the
window
at
the
same
instant
saw
him
raise
his
hand
and
at
the
signal
tossed
my
rocket
into
the
room
with
cry
of
“Fire
the
word
was
no
sooner
out
of
my
mouth
than
the
whole
crowd
of
spectators
well
dressed
and
ill
gentlemen
ostlers
and
servant
maids
joined
in
general
shriek
of
“Fire
thick
clouds
of
smoke
curled
through
the
room
and
out
at
the
open
window
caught
glimpse
of
rushing
figures
and
moment
later
the
voice
of
holmes
from
within
assuring
them
that
it
was
false
alarm
slipping
through
the
shouting
crowd
made
my
way
to
the
corner
of
the
street
and
in
ten
minutes
was
rejoiced
to
find
my
friend’s
arm
in
mine
and
to
get
away
from
the
scene
of
uproar
he
walked
swiftly
and
in
silence
for
some
few
minutes
until
we
had
turned
down
one
of
the
quiet
streets
which
lead
towards
the
edgeware
road
“You
did
it
very
nicely
doctor
he
remarked
“Nothing
could
have
been
better
it
is
all
right
“You
have
the
photograph
“I
know
where
it
is
“And
how
did
you
find
out
“She
showed
me
as
told
you
she
would
“I
am
still
in
the
dark
“I
do
not
wish
to
make
mystery
said
he
laughing
“The
matter
was
perfectly
simple
you
of
course
saw
that
everyone
in
the
street
was
an
accomplice
they
were
all
engaged
for
the
evening
“I
guessed
as
much
“Then
when
the
row
broke
out
had
little
moist
red
paint
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
rushed
forward
fell
down
clapped
my
hand
to
my
face
and
became
piteous
spectacle
it
is
an
old
trick

“That
also
could
fathom
“Then
they
carried
me
in
she
was
bound
to
have
me
in
what
else
could
she
do
and
into
her
sitting
room
which
was
the
very
room
which
suspected
it
lay
between
that
and
her
bedroom
and
was
determined
to
see
which
they
laid
me
on
couch
motioned
for
air
they
were
compelled
to
open
the
window
and
you
had
your
chance
“How
did
that
help
you
“It
was
all
important
when
woman
thinks
that
her
house
is
on
fire
her
instinct
is
at
once
to
rush
to
the
thing
which
she
values
most
it
is
perfectly
overpowering
impulse
and
have
more
than
once
taken
advantage
of
it
in
the
case
of
the
darlington
substitution
scandal
it
was
of
use
to
me

also
in
the
arnsworth
castle
business
married
woman
grabs
at
her
baby
an
unmarried
one
reaches
for
her
jewel
box
now
it
was
clear
to
me
that
our
lady
of
to
day
had
nothing
in
the
house
more
precious
to
her
than
what
we
are
in
quest
of
she
would
rush
to
secure
it
the
alarm
of
fire
was
admirably
done
the
smoke
and
shouting
were
enough
to
shake
nerves
of
steel
she
responded
beautifully
the
photograph
is
in
recess
behind
sliding
panel
just
above
the
right
bell
pull
she
was
there
in
an
instant
and
caught
glimpse
of
it
as
she
half
drew
it
out
when
cried
out
that
it
was
false
alarm
she
replaced
it
glanced
at
the
rocket
rushed
from
the
room
and
have
not
seen
her
since
rose
and
making
my
excuses
escaped
from
the
house
hesitated
whether
to
attempt
to
secure
the
photograph
at
once
but
the
coachman
had
come
in
and
as
he
was
watching
me
narrowly
it
seemed
safer
to
wait
little
over
precipitance
may
ruin
all
“And
now
asked
“Our
quest
is
practically
finished
shall
call
with
the
king
to
morrow
and
with
you
if
you
care
to
come
with
us
we
will
be
shown
into
the
sitting
room
to
wait
for
the
lady
but
it
is
probable
that
when
she
comes
she
may
find
neither
us
nor
the
photograph
it
might
be
satisfaction
to
his
majesty
to
regain
it
with
his
own
hands
“And
when
will
you
call
“At
eight
in
the
morning
she
will
not
be
up
so
that
we
shall
have
clear
field
besides
we
must
be
prompt
for
this
marriage
may
mean
complete
change
in
her
life
and
habits
must
wire
to
the
king
without
delay
we
had
reached
baker
street
and
had
stopped
at
the
door
he
was
searching
his
pockets
for
the
key
when
someone
passing
said
“Good
night
mister
sherlock
holmes
there
were
several
people
on
the
pavement
at
the
time
but
the
greeting
appeared
to
come
from
slim
youth
in
an
ulster
who
had
hurried
by
“I’ve
heard
that
voice
before
said
holmes
staring
down
the
dimly
lit
street
“Now
wonder
who
the
deuce
that
could
have
been
iii
slept
at
baker
street
that
night
and
we
were
engaged
upon
our
toast
and
coffee
in
the
morning
when
the
king
of
bohemia
rushed
into
the
room
“You
have
really
got
it
he
cried
grasping
sherlock
holmes
by
either
shoulder
and
looking
eagerly
into
his
face
“Not
yet
“But
you
have
hopes
“I
have
hopes
“Then
come
am
all
impatience
to
be
gone
“We
must
have
cab
“No
my
brougham
is
waiting
“Then
that
will
simplify
matters
we
descended
and
started
off
once
more
for
briony
lodge
“Irene
adler
is
married
remarked
holmes
“Married
when
“Yesterday
“But
to
whom
“To
an
english
lawyer
named
norton
“But
she
could
not
love
him
“I
am
in
hopes
that
she
does
“And
why
in
hopes
“Because
it
would
spare
your
majesty
all
fear
of
future
annoyance
if
the
lady
loves
her
husband
she
does
not
love
your
majesty
if
she
does
not
love
your
majesty
there
is
no
reason
why
she
should
interfere
with
your
majesty’s
plan
“It
is
true
and
yet—
well
wish
she
had
been
of
my
own
station
what
queen
she
would
have
made
he
relapsed
into
moody
silence
which
was
not
broken
until
we
drew
up
in
serpentine
avenue
the
door
of
briony
lodge
was
open
and
an
elderly
woman
stood
upon
the
steps
she
watched
us
with
sardonic
eye
as
we
stepped
from
the
brougham
“Mr
sherlock
holmes
believe
said
she
“I
am
mr
holmes
answered
my
companion
looking
at
her
with
questioning
and
rather
startled
gaze
“Indeed
my
mistress
told
me
that
you
were
likely
to
call
she
left
this
morning
with
her
husband
by
the
15
train
from
charing
cross
for
the
continent
“What
sherlock
holmes
staggered
back
white
with
chagrin
and
surprise
“Do
you
mean
that
she
has
left
england
“Never
to
return
“And
the
papers
asked
the
king
hoarsely
“All
is
lost
“We
shall
see
he
pushed
past
the
servant
and
rushed
into
the
drawing
room
followed
by
the
king
and
myself
the
furniture
was
scattered

dismantled
shelves
and
open
drawers
as
if
the
lady
had
hurriedly
ransacked
them
before
her
flight
holmes
rushed
at
the
bell
pull
tore
back
small
sliding
shutter
and
plunging
in
his
hand
pulled
out
photograph
and
letter
the
photograph
was
of
irene
adler
herself
in
evening
dress
the
letter
was
superscribed
to
“Sherlock
holmes
esq
to
be
left
till
called
for
my
friend
tore
it
open
and
we
all
three
read
it
together
it
was
dated
at
midnight
of
the
preceding
night
and
ran
in
this
way
“MY
dear
mr
sherlock
holmes
you
really
did
it
very
well
you
took
me
in
completely
until
after
the
alarm
of
fire
had
not
suspicion
but
then
when
found
how
had
betrayed
myself
began
to
think
had
been
warned
against
you
months
ago
had
been
told
that
if
the
king
employed
an
agent
it
would
certainly
be
you
and
your
address
had
been
given
me
yet
with
all
this
you
made
me
reveal
what
you
wanted
to
know
even
after
became
suspicious
found
it
hard
to
think
evil
of
such
dear
kind
old
clergyman
but
you
know
have
been
trained
as
an
actress
myself
male
costume
is
nothing
new
to
me
often
take
advantage
of
the
freedom
which
it
gives
sent
john
the
coachman
to
watch
you
ran
upstairs
got
into
my
walking
clothes
as
call
them
and
came
down
just
as
you
departed
“Well
followed
you
to
your
door
and
so
made
sure
that
was
really
an
object
of
interest
to
the
celebrated
mr
sherlock
holmes
then
rather
imprudently
wished
you
good
night
and
started
for
the
temple
to
see
my
husband
“We
both
thought
the
best
resource
was
flight
when
pursued
by
so
formidable
an
antagonist
so
you
will
find
the
nest
empty
when
you
call
to
morrow
as
to
the
photograph
your
client
may
rest
in
peace
love
and
am
loved
by
better
man
than
he
the
king
may
do
what
he
will
without
hindrance
from
one
whom
he
has
cruelly
wronged
keep
it
only
to
safeguard
myself
and
to
preserve
weapon
which
will
always
secure
me
from
any
steps
which
he
might
take
in
the
future
leave
photograph
which
he
might
care
to
possess
and
remain
dear
mr
sherlock
holmes
“Very
truly
yours
“IRENE
norton
née
adler
“What
woman
oh
what
woman
cried
the
king
of
bohemia
when
we
had
all
three
read
this
epistle
“Did
not
tell
you
how
quick
and
resolute
she
was
would
she
not
have
made
an
admirable
queen
is
it
not
pity
that
she
was
not
on
my
level
“From
what
have
seen
of
the
lady
she
seems
indeed
to
be
on
very
different
level
to
your
majesty
said
holmes
coldly
“I
am
sorry
that
have
not
been
able
to
bring
your
majesty’s
business
to
more
successful
conclusion
“On
the
contrary
my
dear
sir
cried
the
king
“nothing
could
be
more
successful
know
that
her
word
is
inviolate
the
photograph
is
now
as
safe
as
if
it
were
in
the
fire
“I
am
glad
to
hear
your
majesty
say
so
“I
am
immensely
indebted
to
you
pray
tell
me
in
what
way
can
reward
you
this
ring—”
he
slipped
an
emerald
snake
ring
from
his
finger
and
held
it
out
upon
the
palm
of
his
hand
“Your
majesty
has
something
which
should
value
even
more
highly
said
holmes
“You
have
but
to
name
it
“This
photograph
the
king
stared
at
him
in
amazement
“Irene’s
photograph
he
cried
“Certainly
if
you
wish
it
“I
thank
your
majesty
then
there
is
no
more
to
be
done
in
the
matter
have
the
honour
to
wish
you
very
good
morning
he
bowed
and
turning
away
without
observing
the
hand
which
the
king
had
stretched
out
to
him
he
set
off
in
my
company
for
his
chambers
and
that
was
how
great
scandal
threatened
to
affect
the
kingdom
of
bohemia
and
how
the
best
plans
of
mr
sherlock
holmes
were
beaten
by
woman’s
wit
he
used
to
make
merry
over
the
cleverness
of
women
but
have
not
heard
him
do
it
of
late
and
when
he
speaks
of
irene
adler
or
when
he
refers
to
her
photograph
it
is
always
under
the
honourable
title
of

the
red
headed
league
had
called
upon
my
friend
mr
sherlock
holmes
one
day
in
the
autumn
of
last
year
and
found
him
in
deep
conversation
with
very
stout
florid
faced
elderly
gentleman
with
fiery
red
hair
with
an
apology
for
my
intrusion
was
about
to
withdraw
when
holmes
pulled
me
abruptly
into
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
me
“You
could
not
possibly
have
come
at
better
time
my
dear
watson
he
said
cordially
“I
was
afraid
that
you
were
engaged
“So
am
very
much
so
“Then
can
wait
in
the
next
room
“Not
at
all
this
gentleman
mr
wilson
has
been
my
partner
and
helper
in
many
of
my
most
successful
cases
and
have
no
doubt
that
he
will
be
of
the
utmost
use
to
me
in
yours
also
the
stout
gentleman
half
rose
from
his
chair
and
gave
bob
of
greeting
with
quick
little
questioning
glance
from
his
small
fat
encircled
eyes
“Try
the
settee
said
holmes
relapsing
into
his
armchair
and
putting
his
fingertips
together
as
was
his
custom
when
in
judicial
moods
“I
know
my
dear
watson
that
you
share
my
love
of
all
that
is
bizarre
and
outside
the
conventions
and
humdrum
routine
of
everyday
life
you
have
shown
your
relish
for
it
by
the
enthusiasm
which
has
prompted
you
to
chronicle
and
if
you
will
excuse
my
saying
so
somewhat
to
embellish
so
many
of
my
own
little
adventures
“Your
cases
have
indeed
been
of
the
greatest
interest
to
me
observed
“You
will
remember
that
remarked
the
other
day
just
before
we
went
into
the
very
simple
problem
presented
by
miss
mary
sutherland
that
for
strange
effects
and
extraordinary
combinations
we
must
go
to
life
itself
which
is
always
far
more
daring
than
any
effort
of
the
imagination
“A
proposition
which
took
the
liberty
of
doubting
“You
did
doctor
but
none
the
less
you
must
come
round
to
my
view
for
otherwise
shall
keep
on
piling
fact
upon
fact
on
you
until
your
reason
breaks
down
under
them
and
acknowledges
me
to
be
right
now
mr
jabez
wilson
here
has
been
good
enough
to
call
upon
me
this
morning
and
to
begin
narrative
which
promises
to
be
one
of
the
most
singular
which
have
listened
to
for
some
time
you
have
heard
me
remark
that
the
strangest
and
most
unique
things
are
very
often
connected
not
with
the
larger
but
with
the
smaller
crimes
and
occasionally
indeed
where
there
is
room
for
doubt
whether
any
positive
crime
has
been
committed
as
far
as
have
heard
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
whether
the
present
case
is
an
instance
of
crime
or
not
but
the
course
of
events
is
certainly
among
the
most
singular
that
have
ever
listened
to
perhaps
mr
wilson
you
would
have
the
great
kindness
to
recommence
your
narrative
ask
you
not
merely
because
my
friend
dr
watson
has
not
heard
the
opening
part
but
also
because
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
story
makes
me
anxious
to
have
every
possible
detail
from
your
lips
as
rule
when
have
heard
some
slight
indication
of
the
course
of
events
am
able
to
guide
myself
by
the
thousands
of
other
similar
cases
which
occur
to
my
memory
in
the
present
instance
am
forced
to
admit
that
the
facts
are
to
the
best
of
my
belief
unique
the
portly
client
puffed
out
his
chest
with
an
appearance
of
some
little
pride
and
pulled
dirty
and
wrinkled
newspaper
from
the
inside
pocket
of
his
greatcoat
as
he
glanced
down
the
advertisement
column
with
his
head
thrust
forward
and
the
paper
flattened
out
upon
his
knee
took
good
look
at
the
man
and
endeavoured
after
the
fashion
of
my
companion
to
read
the
indications
which
might
be
presented
by
his
dress
or
appearance
did
not
gain
very
much
however
by
my
inspection
our
visitor
bore
every
mark
of
being
an
average
commonplace
british
tradesman
obese
pompous
and
slow
he
wore
rather
baggy
grey
shepherd’s
check
trousers
not
over
clean
black
frock
coat
unbuttoned
in
the
front
and
drab
waistcoat
with
heavy
brassy
albert
chain
and
square
pierced
bit
of
metal
dangling
down
as
an
ornament
frayed
top
hat
and
faded
brown
overcoat
with
wrinkled
velvet
collar
lay
upon
chair
beside
him
altogether
look
as
would
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
the
man
save
his
blazing
red
head
and
the
expression
of
extreme
chagrin
and
discontent
upon
his
features
sherlock
holmes’
quick
eye
took
in
my
occupation
and
he
shook
his
head
with
smile
as
he
noticed
my
questioning
glances
“Beyond
the
obvious
facts
that
he
has
at
some
time
done
manual
labour
that
he
takes
snuff
that
he
is
freemason
that
he
has
been
in
china
and
that
he
has
done
considerable
amount
of
writing
lately
can
deduce
nothing
else
mr
jabez
wilson
started
up
in
his
chair
with
his
forefinger
upon
the
paper
but
his
eyes
upon
my
companion
“How
in
the
name
of
good
fortune
did
you
know
all
that
mr
holmes
he
asked
“How
did
you
know
for
example
that
did
manual
labour
it’s
as
true
as
gospel
for
began
as
ship’s
carpenter
“Your
hands
my
dear
sir
your
right
hand
is
quite
size
larger
than
your
left
you
have
worked
with
it
and
the
muscles
are
more
developed
“Well
the
snuff
then
and
the
freemasonry
“I
won’t
insult
your
intelligence
by
telling
you
how
read
that
especially
as
rather
against
the
strict
rules
of
your
order
you
use
an
arc
and
compass
breastpin
“Ah
of
course
forgot
that
but
the
writing
“What
else
can
be
indicated
by
that
right
cuff
so
very
shiny
for
five
inches
and
the
left
one
with
the
smooth
patch
near
the
elbow
where
you
rest
it
upon
the
desk
“Well
but
china
“The
fish
that
you
have
tattooed
immediately
above
your
right
wrist
could
only
have
been
done
in
china
have
made
small
study
of
tattoo
marks
and
have
even
contributed
to
the
literature
of
the
subject
that
trick
of
staining
the
fishes’
scales
of
delicate
pink
is
quite
peculiar
to
china
when
in
addition
see
chinese
coin
hanging
from
your
watch
chain
the
matter
becomes
even
more
simple
mr
jabez
wilson
laughed
heavily
“Well
never
said
he
“I
thought
at
first
that
you
had
done
something
clever
but
see
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
after
all
“I
begin
to
think

said
holmes
“that

mistake
in
explaining
‘Omne

mr
wilson
“Yes

answered
with
his
thick
red
finger
planted
halfway
down
the
column
“Here

what
began
it
all

read
it

took
the
paper
from
him
and
read
as

“What

this

ejaculated
after
had
twice
read
over
the
extraordinary
announcement
holmes
chuckled
and
wriggled
in
his
chair
as
was
his
habit
when
in
high
spirits
“It
is
little
off
the
beaten
track
isn’t
it

he
“And
now
mr

off
you
go
at

all
about

had

make

“Very
good
now
mr

“Well
it
is
just
as
have
been
telling
you
mr
sherlock
holmes
said
jabez
wilson
mopping
his
forehead
“I
have
small
pawnbroker’s
business
at
coburg
square
near
the
city
it’s
not
very
large
affair

of

it

not
done
more
than
just
give

to
be

now
only
keep

that

“What
is

obliging
youth
asked
sherlock
holmes
“His

he’s
not

either
it’s
hard
to
say

very
well
that
he
could
better
himself

what

after

“Why
indeed
you

“Oh
he
has
his
faults
too
said
mr
wilson
“Never
was
such
fellow
for
photography
snapping
away
with
camera
when
he
ought
to
be
improving
his
mind
and
then
diving
down
into
the
cellar
like
rabbit
into
its
hole
to
develop
his
pictures
that
is
his
main
fault
but
on
the
whole
he’s
good
worker
there’s
no
vice
in
him
“He
is
still
with
you

“Yes
sir
he
and
girl
of
fourteen

does
bit
of
simple
cooking

keeps
the

clean

live
very
quietly
sir
the
three
of

we
keep

pay
our

if
we
do
nothing
more
“The
first
thing
that
put
us
out
was
that
advertisement
spaulding
he
came
down
into
the
office
just
this
day
eight
weeks
with
this
very
paper
in
his
hand
and
he
says
‘I
wish
to
the
lord
mr
wilson
that
was
red
headed
man
‘Why
that
asks
‘Why
says
he
‘here’s
another
vacancy
on
the
league
of
the
red
headed

it’s
worth
quite
little
fortune
to
any
man
who
gets
it
and
understand
that
there
are
more
vacancies
than
there
are
men
so
that
the
trustees
are
at
their
wits’
end
what
to
do
with
the
money
if
my
hair
would
only
change
colour
here’s
nice
little
crib
all
ready
for
me
to
step
into
‘Why
what
is
it
then
asked
you
see
mr
holmes
am
very
stay
at

man
and
as
my
business
came
to
me
instead
of
my
having
to
go
to
it
was
often
weeks
on
end
without
putting
my
foot
over
the
door
mat
in
that
way
didn’t
know
much
of
what
was
going
on
outside
and
was
always
glad
of
bit
of
news
‘Have
you
never
heard
of
the
league
of
the
red
headed
men
he
asked
with
his
eyes
open
‘Never
‘Why
wonder
at
that
for
you
are
eligible
yourself
for
one
of
the
vacancies
‘And
what
are
they
worth

‘Oh
merely
couple
of

year
but
the
work
is
slight
and
it
need
not
interfere
very
much
with

you

easily

up

not

‘Well

as
far
as
can
make
out
the
league
was
founded
by
an
american
millionaire
ezekiah
hopkins
who
was
very
peculiar
in
his
ways
he
was
himself
red
headed
and
he
had
great
sympathy
for
all
red
headed
men
so
when
he
died
it
was
found
that
he
had
left
his
enormous
fortune
in
the
hands
of
trustees
with
instructions
to
apply
the
interest
to
the
providing
of
easy
berths
to
men
whose
hair
is
of
that
colour
from
all
hear
it
is
splendid
pay
and
very
little
to
do
‘But
said
‘there
would
be
millions
of
red
headed
men
who
would
apply
‘Not
so
many
as
you
might
think
he
answered
‘You
see
it
is
really
confined
to
londoners
and
to
grown
men
this
american
had
started
from
london
when
he
was
young
and
he
wanted
to
do
the
old
town
good
turn
then
again
have
heard
it
is
no
use
your
applying
if
your
hair
is
light
red
or
dark
red
or
anything
but
real
bright
blazing
fiery
red
now
if
you
cared
to
apply
mr
wilson
you
would
just
walk
in
but
perhaps
it
would
hardly
be
worth
your
while
to
put
yourself
out
of
the
way
for
the
sake
of
few
hundred
pounds
“Now
it
is
fact
gentlemen
as
you
may
see
for
yourselves
that
my
hair
is
of
very
full
and
rich
tint
so
that
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
there
was
to
be
any
competition
in
the
matter
stood
as
good
chance
as
any
man
that
had
ever
met
vincent
spaulding
seemed
to
know
so
much
about
it
that
thought
he
might
prove
useful
so
just
ordered
him
to
put
up
the
shutters
for
the
day
and
to
come
right
away
with
me
he
was
very
willing
to
have
holiday
so
we
shut
the
business
up
and
started
off
for
the
address
that
was
given
us
in
the
advertisement
“I
never
hope
to
see
such
sight
as
that
again
mr
holmes
from
north
south
east
and
west
every
man
who
had
shade
of
red
in
his
hair
had
tramped
into
the
city
to
answer
the
advertisement
fleet
street
was
choked
with
red
headed
folk
and
pope’s
court
looked
like
coster’s
orange
barrow
should
not
have
thought
there
were
so
many
in
the
whole
country
as
were
brought
together
by
that
single
advertisement
every
shade
of
colour
they
were
straw
lemon
orange
brick
irish
setter
liver
clay
but
as
spaulding
said
there
were
not
many
who
had
the
real
vivid
flame
coloured
tint
when
saw
how
many
were
waiting
would
have
given
it
up
in
despair
but
spaulding
would
not
hear
of
it
how
he
did
it
could
not
imagine
but
he
pushed
and
pulled
and
butted
until
he
got
me
through
the
crowd
and
right
up
to
the
steps
which
led
to
the
office
there
was
double
stream
upon
the
stair
some
going
up
in
hope
and
some
coming
back
dejected
but
we
wedged
in
as
well
as
we
could
and
soon
found
ourselves
in
the
office
“Your
experience
has
been
most
entertaining
one
remarked
holmes
as
his
client
paused
and
refreshed
his
memory
with
huge
pinch
of
snuff
“Pray
continue
your
very
interesting
statement
“There
was
nothing
in
the
office
but
couple
of
wooden
chairs
and
deal
table
behind
which
sat
small
man
with
head
that
was
even
redder
than
mine
he
said
few
words
to
each
candidate
as
he
came
up
and
then
he
always
managed
to
find
some
fault
in
them
which
would
disqualify
them
getting
vacancy
did
not
seem
to
be
such
very
easy
matter
after
all
however
when
our
turn
came
the
little
man
was
much
more
favourable
to
me
than
to
any
of
the
others
and
he
closed
the
door
as
we
entered
so
that
he
might
have
private
word
with
us
‘This
is
mr
jabez
wilson
said
my
assistant
‘and
he
is
willing
to
fill
vacancy
in
the
league
‘And
he
is
admirably
suited
for
it
the
other
answered
‘He
has
every
requirement
cannot
recall
when
have
seen
anything
so
fine
he
took
step
backward
cocked
his
head
on
one
side
and
gazed
at
my
hair
until
felt
quite
bashful
then
suddenly
he
plunged
forward
wrung
my
hand
and
congratulated
me
warmly
on
my
success
‘It
would
be
injustice
to
hesitate
said
he
‘You
will
however
am
sure
excuse
me
for
taking
an
obvious
precaution
with
that
he
seized
my
hair
in
both
his
hands
and
tugged
until
yelled
with
the
pain
‘There
is
water
in
your
eyes
said
he
as
he
released
me
‘I
perceive
that
all
is
as
it
should
be
but
we
have
to
be
careful
for
we
have
twice
been
deceived
by
wigs
and
once
by
paint
could
tell
you
tales
of
cobbler’s
wax
which
would
disgust
you
with
human
nature
he
stepped
over
to
the
window
and
shouted
through
it
at
the
top
of
his
voice
that
the
vacancy
was
filled
groan
of
disappointment
came
up
from
below
and
the
folk
all
trooped
away
in
different
directions
until
there
was
not
red
head
to
be
seen
except
my
own
and
that
of
the
manager
‘My
name
said
he
‘is
mr
duncan
ross

of
the
pensioners

the
fund

our
noble
benefactor

man

you

“I
answered
that
had
not
“His
face
fell
immediately
‘Dear
me
he
said
gravely
‘that
is
very
serious
indeed
am
sorry
to
hear
you
say
that
the
fund
was
of
course
for
the
propagation
and
spread
of
the
red
heads
as
well
as
for
their
maintenance
it
is
exceedingly
unfortunate
that
you
should
be
bachelor
“My
face
lengthened
at
this
mr
holmes
for
thought
that
was
not
to
have
the
vacancy
after
all
but
after
thinking
it
over
for
few
minutes
he
said
that
it
would
be
all
right
‘In
the
case
of
another
said
he
‘the
objection
might
be
fatal
but
we
must
stretch
point
in
favour
of
man
with
such
head
of
hair
as
yours
when
shall
you
be
able
to
enter
upon
your
new
duties
‘Well
it
is
little
awkward
for
have
business
already
said
‘Oh
never
mind
about
that
mr
wilson
said
vincent
spaulding
‘I
should
be
able
to
look
after
that
for
you
‘What
would
be

hours
asked
‘Ten

“Now
pawnbroker’s
business
is
mostly
done
of
an
evening
mr
holmes
especially
thursday
and
friday
evening
which
is
just
before
pay
day
so
it
would
suit
me
very
well
to
earn
little
in
the
mornings
besides
knew
that
my
assistant
was
good
man
and
that
he
would
see
to
anything
that
turned
up
‘That

‘Well
you
have
to
be
in
the
office
or
at
least
in
the
building
the
whole
time
if
you
leave
you
forfeit
your
whole

forever
the

is
very
clear
upon
that

don’t

from

he
bowed
me
out
of
the
room
and
went
home
with
my
assistant
hardly
knowing
what
to
say
or
do
was
so
pleased
at
my
own
good
fortune
“Well
thought
over
the
matter
all
day
and
by
evening
was
in
low
spirits
again
for
had
quite
persuaded
myself
that
the
whole
affair
must
be
some
great
hoax
or
fraud
though
what
its
object
might
be
could
not
imagine
it
seemed
altogether
past
belief
that
anyone
could
make
such
will
or
that
they
would
pay
such
sum
for
doing
anything
so
simple
as
copying
out
the
encyclopaedia
britannica
vincent
spaulding
did
what
he
could
to
cheer
me
up
but
by
bedtime
had
reasoned
myself
out
of
the
whole
thing
however
in
the
morning
determined
to
have
look
at
it
anyhow
so
bought
penny
bottle
of
ink
and
with
quill
pen
and
seven
sheets
of
foolscap
paper
started
off
for
pope’s
court
“Well
to
my
surprise
and
delight
everything
was
as
right
as
possible
the
table
was
set
out
ready
for
me
and
mr
duncan
ross
was
there
to
see
that
got
fairly
to
work
he
started
me
off
upon
the
letter
and
then
he
left
me
but
he
would
drop
in
from
time
to
time
to
see
that
all
was
right
with
me
at
two
o’clock
he
bade
me
good
day
complimented
me
upon
the
amount
that
had
written
and
locked
the
door
of
the
office
after
me
“This
went
on
day
after
day
mr
holmes
and
on
saturday
the
manager
came
in
and
planked
down
four
golden
sovereigns
for
my
week’s
work
it
was
the
same
next
week
and
the
same
the
week
after
every
morning
was
there
at
ten
and
every
afternoon
left
at
two
by
degrees
mr
duncan
ross
took
to
coming
in
only
once
of
morning
and
then
after
time
he
did
not
come
in
at
all
still
of
course
never
dared
to
leave
the
room
for
an
instant
for
was
not
sure
when
he
might
come
and
the
billet
was
such
good
one
and
suited
me
so
well
that
would
not
risk
the
loss
of
it
“Eight
weeks
passed
away
like
this
and
had
written
about
abbots
and
archery
and
armour
and
architecture
and
attica
and
hoped
with
diligence
that
might
get
on
to
the
b’s
before
very
long
it
cost
me
something
in
foolscap
and
had
pretty
nearly
filled
shelf
with
my
writings
and
then
suddenly
the
whole
business
came
to
an
end
“To
an
end
“Yes
sir
and
no
later
than
this
morning
went
to
my
work
as
usual
at
ten
o’clock
but
the
door
was
shut
and
locked
with
little
square
of
cardboard
hammered
on
to
the
middle
of
the
panel
with
tack
here
it
is

can
read
for
yourself

held
up
piece
of

cardboard
about
the
size
of

of

read
in
this
fashion

headed

dissolved

1890
sherlock
holmes
and
surveyed
this
curt
announcement
and
the
rueful
face
behind
it
until
the
comical
side
of
the
affair
so
completely
overtopped
every
other
consideration
that
we
both
burst
out
into
roar
of
laughter
“I
cannot
see
that
there
is
anything
very
funny
cried
our
client
flushing
up
to
the
roots
of
his
flaming
head
“If
you
can
do
nothing
better
than
laugh
at
me
can
go
elsewhere
“No
no
cried
holmes
shoving
him
back
into
the
chair
from
which
he
had
half
risen
“I
really
wouldn’t
miss
your
case
for
the
world
it
is
most
refreshingly
unusual
but
there
is
if
you
will
excuse
my
saying
so
something
just
little
funny
about
it
pray
what
steps
did
you
take
when
you
found
the
card
upon
the
door
“I
was
staggered
sir
did
not
know
what
to
do
then
called
at
the
offices
round
but
none
of
them
seemed
to
know
anything
about
it
finally
went
to
the
landlord
who
is
an
accountant
living
on
the
ground
floor
and
asked
him
if
he
could
tell
me
what
had
become
of
the
red
headed
league
he
said
that
he
had
never
heard
of
any
such
body
then
asked
him
who
mr
duncan
ross
was
he
answered
that
the
name
was
new
to
him
‘Well
said
‘the
gentleman
at
no
‘What
the
red
headed
man
‘Yes
‘Oh
said
he
‘his
name
was
william
morris
he
was
solicitor
and
was
using
my
room
as
temporary
convenience
until
his
new
premises
were
ready
he
moved
out
yesterday
‘Where
could
find
him
‘Oh
at
his
new
offices
he
did
tell
me
the
address
yes
17
king
edward
street
near
st
paul’s
“I
started
off
mr
holmes
but
when
got
to
that
address
it
was
manufactory
of
artificial
knee
caps
and
no
one
in
it
had
ever
heard
of
either
mr
william
morris
or
mr
duncan
ross
“And
what
did
you
do
then
asked
holmes
“I
went
home
to
saxe
coburg
square
and
took
the
advice
of
my
assistant
but
he
could
not
help
me
in
any
way
he
could
only
say
that
if
waited
should
hear
by
post
but
that
was
not
quite
good
enough
mr
holmes
did
not
wish
to
lose
such
place
without
struggle
so
as
had
heard
that
you
were
good
enough
to
give
advice
to
poor
folk
who
were
in
need
of
it
came
right
away
to
you
“And
you
did
very
wisely
said
holmes
“Your
case
is
an
exceedingly
remarkable
one
and
shall
be
happy
to
look
into
it
from
what
you
have
told
me
think
that
it
is
possible
that
graver
issues
hang
from
it
than
might
at
first
sight
appear
“Grave
enough
said
mr
jabez
wilson
“Why
have
lost
four
pound
week
“As
far
as
you
are
personally
concerned
remarked
holmes
“I
do
not
see
that
you
have
any
grievance
against
this
extraordinary
league
on
the
contrary
you
are
as
understand
richer
by
some
£30
to
say
nothing
of
the
minute
knowledge
which
you
have
gained
on
every
subject
which
comes
under
the
letter
you
have
lost
nothing
by
them
“No
sir
but
want
to
find
out
about
them
and
who
they
are
and
what
their
object
was
in
playing
this
prank
if
it
was
prank
upon
me
it
was
pretty
expensive
joke
for
them
for
it
cost
them
two
and
thirty
pounds
“We
shall
endeavour
to
clear
up
these
points
for
you
and
first
one
or
two
questions
mr
wilson
this
assistant
of
yours
who
first
called
your
attention
to
the
advertisement
how
long
had
he
been
with
you
“About
month
then
“How
did
he
come
“In
answer
to
an
advertisement
“Was
he
the
only
applicant
“No
had
dozen
“Why
did
you
pick
him
“Because
he
was
handy
and
would
come
cheap
“At
half
wages
in
fact
“Yes
“What
is
he
like
this
vincent
spaulding
“Small
stout
built
very
quick
in
his
ways
no
hair
on
his
face
though
he’s
not
short
of
thirty
has
white
splash
of
acid
upon
his
forehead
holmes
sat
up
in
his
chair
in
considerable
excitement
“I
thought
as
much
said
he
“Have
you
ever
observed
that
his
ears
are
pierced
for
earrings
“Yes
sir
he
told
me
that
gipsy
had
done
it
for
him
when
he
was
lad
“Hum
said
holmes
sinking
back
in
deep
thought
“He
is
still
with
you
“Oh
yes
sir
have
only
just
left
him
“And
has
your
business
been
attended
to
in
your
absence
“Nothing
to
complain
of
sir
there’s
never
very
much
to
do
of
morning
“That
will
do
mr
wilson
shall
be
happy
to
give
you
an
opinion
upon
the
subject
in
the
course
of
day
or
two
to
day
is
saturday
and
hope
that
by
monday
we
may
come
to
conclusion
“Well
watson
said
holmes
when
our
visitor
had
left
us
“what
do
you
make
of
it
all
“I
make
nothing
of
it
answered
frankly
“It
is
most
mysterious
business
“As
rule
said
holmes
“the
more
bizarre
thing
is
the
less
mysterious
it
proves
to
be
it
is
your
commonplace
featureless
crimes
which
are
really
puzzling
just
as
commonplace
face
is
the
most
difficult
to
identify
but
must
be
prompt
over
this
matter

are
you
going
to
do

“It
is
quite
three
pipe
problem
and
beg
that
you
won’t
speak
to
me
for
fifty
minutes
he
curled
himself
up
in
his
chair
with
his
thin
knees
drawn
up
to
his
hawk
like
nose
and
there
he
sat
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
black
clay
pipe
thrusting
out
like
the
bill
of
some
strange
bird
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
dropped
asleep
and
indeed
was
nodding
myself
when
he
suddenly
sprang
out
of
his
chair
with
the
gesture
of
man
who
has
made
up
his
mind
and
put
his
pipe
down
upon
the
mantelpiece
“Sarasate
plays
at
the
st
james’s
hall
this
afternoon
he
remarked
“What
do
you
think
watson
could
your
patients
spare
you
for
few
hours
“I
have
nothing
to
do
to
day
my
practice
is
never
very
absorbing
“Then
put
on
your
hat
and
come
am
going
through
the
city
first
and
we
can
have
some
lunch
on
the
way
observe
that
there
is
good
deal
of
german
music
on
the
programme
which
is
rather
more
to
my
taste
than
italian
or
french
it
is
introspective
and
want
to
introspect
come
along
we
travelled
by
the
underground
as
far
as
aldersgate
and
short
walk
took
us
to
saxe
coburg
square
the
scene
of
the
singular
story
which
we
had
listened
to
in
the
morning
it
was
poky
little
shabby
genteel
place
where
four
lines
of
dingy
two
storied
brick
houses
looked
out
into
small
railed
in
enclosure
where
lawn
of
weedy
grass
and
few
clumps
of
faded
laurel
bushes
made
hard
fight
against
smoke
laden
and
uncongenial
atmosphere
three
gilt
balls
and
brown
board
with
“JABEZ
wilson”
in
white
letters
upon
corner
house
announced
the
place
where
our
red
headed
client
carried
on
his
business
sherlock
holmes
stopped
in
front
of
it
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
looked
it
all
over
with
his
eyes
shining
brightly
between
puckered
lids
then
he
walked
slowly
up
the
street
and
then
down
again
to
the
corner
still
looking
keenly
at
the
houses
finally
he
returned
to
the
pawnbroker’s
and
having
thumped
vigorously
upon
the
pavement
with
his
stick
two
or
three
times
he
went
up
to
the
door
and
knocked
it
was
instantly
opened
by
bright
looking
clean
shaven
young
fellow
who
asked
him
to
step
in
“Thank
you
said
holmes
“I
only
wished
to
ask
you
how
you
would
go
from
here
to
the
strand
“Third
right
fourth
left
answered
the
assistant
promptly
closing
the
door
“Smart
fellow
that
observed
holmes
as
we
walked
away
“He
is
in
my
judgment
the
fourth
smartest
man
in
london
and
for
daring
am
not
sure
that
he
has
not
claim
to
be
third
have
known
something
of
him
before
“Evidently
said
“Mr
wilson’s
assistant
counts
for
good
deal
in
this
mystery
of
the
red
headed
league
am
sure
that
you
inquired
your
way
merely
in
order
that
you
might
see
him
“Not
him
“What
then
“The
knees
of
his
trousers
“And
what
did
you
see
“What
expected
to
see
“Why
did
you
beat
the
pavement
“My
dear
doctor
this
is
time
for
observation
not
for
talk
we
are
spies
in
an
enemy’s
country
we
know
something
of
saxe
coburg
square
let
us
now
explore
the
parts
which
lie
behind
it
the
road
in
which
we
found
ourselves
as
we
turned
round
the
corner
from
the
retired
saxe
coburg
square
presented
as
great
contrast
to
it
as
the
front
of
picture
does
to
the
back
it
was
one
of
the
main
arteries
which
conveyed
the
traffic
of
the
city
to
the
north
and
west
the
roadway
was
blocked
with
the
immense
stream
of
commerce
flowing
in
double
tide
inward
and
outward
while
the
footpaths
were
black
with
the
hurrying
swarm
of
pedestrians
it
was
difficult
to
realise
as
we
looked
at
the
line
of
fine
shops
and
stately
business
premises
that
they
really
abutted
on
the
other
side
upon
the
faded
and
stagnant
square
which
we
had
just
quitted
“Let
me
see
said
holmes
standing
at
the
corner
and
glancing
along
the
line
“I
should
like
just
to
remember
the
order
of
the
houses
here
it
is
hobby
of
mine
to
have
an
exact
knowledge
of
london
there
is
mortimer’s
the
tobacconist
the
little
newspaper
shop
the
coburg
branch
of
the
city
and
suburban
bank
the
vegetarian
restaurant
and
mcFarlane’s
carriage
building
depot
that
carries
us
right
on
to
the
other
block
and
now
doctor
we’ve
done
our
work
so
it’s
time
we
had
some
play
sandwich
and
cup
of
coffee
and
then
off
to
violin
land
where
all
is
sweetness
and
delicacy
and
harmony
and
there
are
no
red
headed
clients
to
vex
us
with
their
conundrums
my
friend
was
an
enthusiastic
musician
being
himself
not
only
very
capable
performer
but
composer
of
no
ordinary
merit
all
the
afternoon
he
sat
in
the
stalls
wrapped
in
the
most
perfect
happiness
gently
waving
his
long
thin
fingers
in
time
to
the
music
while
his
gently
smiling
face
and
his
languid
dreamy
eyes
were
as
unlike
those
of
holmes
the
sleuth
hound
holmes
the
relentless
keen
witted
ready
handed
criminal
agent
as
it
was
possible
to
conceive
in
his
singular
character
the
dual
nature
alternately
asserted
itself
and
his
extreme
exactness
and
astuteness
represented
as
have
often
thought
the
reaction
against
the
poetic
and
contemplative
mood
which
occasionally
predominated
in
him
the
swing
of
his
nature
took
him
from
extreme
languor
to
devouring
energy
and
as
knew
well
he
was
never
so
truly
formidable
as
when
for
days
on
end
he
had
been
lounging
in
his
armchair
amid
his
improvisations
and
his
black
letter
editions
then
it
was
that
the
lust
of
the
chase
would
suddenly
come
upon
him
and
that
his
brilliant
reasoning
power
would
rise
to
the
level
of
intuition
until
those
who
were
unacquainted
with
his
methods
would
look
askance
at
him
as
on
man
whose
knowledge
was
not
that
of
other
mortals
when
saw
him
that
afternoon
so
enwrapped
in
the
music
at
st
james’s
hall
felt
that
an
evil
time
might
be
coming
upon
those
whom
he
had
set
himself
to
hunt
down
“You
want
to
go
home
no
doubt
doctor
he
remarked
as
we
emerged
“Yes
it
would
be
as
well
“And
have
some
business
to
do
which
will
take
some
hours
this
business
at
coburg
square
is
serious
“Why
serious
“A
considerable
crime
is
in
contemplation
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
we
shall
be
in
time
to
stop
it
but
to
day
being
saturday
rather
complicates
matters
shall
want
your
help
to
night
“At
what
time
“Ten
will
be
early
enough
“I
shall
be
at
baker
street
at
ten
“Very
well
and
say
doctor
there
may
be
some
little
danger
so
kindly
put
your
army
revolver
in
your
pocket
he
waved
his
hand
turned
on
his
heel
and
disappeared
in
an
instant
among
the
crowd
trust
that
am
not
more
dense
than
my
neighbours
but
was
always
oppressed
with
sense
of
my
own
stupidity
in
my
dealings
with
sherlock
holmes
here
had
heard
what
he
had
heard
had
seen
what
he
had
seen
and
yet
from
his
words
it
was
evident
that
he
saw
clearly
not
only
what
had
happened
but
what
was
about
to
happen
while
to
me
the
whole
business
was
still
confused
and
grotesque
as
drove
home
to
my
house
in
kensington
thought
over
it
all
from
the
extraordinary
story
of
the
red
headed
copier
of
the
encyclopaedia
down
to
the
visit
to
saxe
coburg
square
and
the
ominous
words
with
which
he
had
parted
from
me
what
was
this
nocturnal
expedition
and
why
should
go
armed
where
were
we
going
and
what
were
we
to
do
had
the
hint
from
holmes
that
this
smooth
faced
pawnbroker’s
assistant
was
formidable
man
who
might
play
deep
game
tried
to
puzzle
it
out
but
gave
it
up
in
despair
and
set
the
matter
aside
until
night
should
bring
an
explanation
it
was
quarter
past
nine
when
started
from
home
and
made
my
way
across
the
park
and
so
through
oxford
street
to
baker
street
two
hansoms
were
standing
at
the
door
and
as
entered
the
passage
heard
the
sound
of
voices
from
above
on
entering
his
room
found
holmes
in
animated
conversation
with
two
men
one
of
whom
recognised
as
peter
jones
the
official
police
agent
while
the
other
was
long
thin
sad
faced
man
with
very
shiny
hat
and
oppressively
respectable
frock
coat
“Ha
our
party
is
complete
said
holmes
buttoning
up
his
pea
jacket
and
taking
his
heavy
hunting
crop
from
the
rack
“Watson
think
you
know
mr
jones
of
scotland
yard
let
me
introduce
you
to
mr
merryweather
who
is
to
be
our
companion
in
to
night’s
adventure
“We’re
hunting
in
couples
again
doctor
you
see
said
jones
in
his
consequential
way
“Our
friend
here
is
wonderful
man
for
starting
chase
all
he
wants
is
an
old
dog
to
help
him
to
do
the
running
down
“I
hope
wild
goose
may
not
prove
to
be
the
end
of
our
chase
observed
mr
merryweather
gloomily
“You
may
place
considerable
confidence
in
mr
holmes
sir
said
the
police
agent
loftily
“He
has
his
own
little
methods
which
are
if
he
won’t
mind
my
saying
so
just
little
too
theoretical
and
fantastic
but
he
has
the
makings
of
detective
in
him
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
once
or
twice
as
in
that
business
of
the
sholto
murder
and
the
agra
treasure
he
has
been
more
nearly
correct
than
the
official
force

“Oh
if
you
say
so
mr
jones
it
is
all
right
said
the
stranger
with
deference
“Still
confess
that
miss
my
rubber
it
is
the
first
saturday
night
for
seven
and
twenty
years
that
have
not
had
my
rubber
“I
think
you
will
find
said
sherlock
holmes
“that
you
will
play
for
higher
stake
to
night
than
you
have
ever
done
yet
and
that
the
play
will
be
more
exciting
for
you
mr
merryweather
the
stake
will
be
some
£30
000
and
for
you
jones
it
will
be
the
man
upon
whom
you
wish
to
lay
your
hands
“John
clay
the
murderer
thief
smasher
and
forger
he’s
young
man
mr
merryweather
but
he
is
at
the
head
of
his
profession
and
would
rather
have
my
bracelets
on
him
than
on
any
criminal
in
london
he’s
remarkable
man
is
young
john
clay
his
grandfather
was
royal
duke
and
he
himself
has
been
to
eton
and
oxford
his
brain
is
as
cunning
as
his
fingers
and
though
we
meet
signs
of
him
at
every
turn
we
never
know
where
to
find
the
man
himself
he’ll
crack
crib
in
scotland
one
week
and
be
raising
money
to
build
an
orphanage
in
cornwall
the
next
i’ve
been
on
his
track
for
years
and
have
never
set
eyes
on
him
yet
“I
hope
that
may
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
you
to
night
i’ve
had
one
or
two
little
turns
also
with
mr
john
clay
and
agree
with
you
that
he
is
at
the
head
of
his
profession
it
is
past
ten
however
and
quite
time
that
we
started
if
you
two
will
take
the
first
hansom
watson
and
will
follow
in
the
second
sherlock
holmes
was
not
very
communicative
during
the
long
drive
and
lay
back
in
the
cab
humming
the
tunes
which
he
had
heard
in
the
afternoon
we
rattled
through
an
endless
labyrinth
of
gas
lit
streets
until
we
emerged
into
farrington
street
“We
are
close
there
now
my
friend
remarked
“This
fellow
merryweather
is
bank
director
and
personally
interested
in
the
matter
thought
it
as
well
to
have
jones
with
us
also
he
is
not
bad
fellow
though
an
absolute
imbecile
in
his
profession
he
has
one
positive
virtue
he
is
as
brave
as
bulldog
and
as
tenacious
as
lobster
if
he
gets
his
claws
upon
anyone
here
we
are
and
they
are
waiting
for
us
we
had
reached
the
same
crowded
thoroughfare
in
which
we
had
found
ourselves
in
the
morning
our
cabs
were
dismissed
and
following
the
guidance
of
mr
merryweather
we
passed
down
narrow
passage
and
through
side
door
which
he
opened
for
us
within
there
was
small
corridor
which
ended
in
very
massive
iron
gate
this
also
was
opened
and
led
down
flight
of
winding
stone
steps
which
terminated
at
another
formidable
gate
mr
merryweather
stopped
to
light
lantern
and
then
conducted
us
down
dark
earth
smelling
passage
and
so
after
opening
third
door
into
huge
vault
or
cellar
which
was
piled
all
round
with
crates
and
massive
boxes
“You
are
not
very
vulnerable
from
above
holmes
remarked
as
he
held
up
the
lantern
and
gazed
about
him
“Nor
from
below
said
mr
merryweather
striking
his
stick
upon
the
flags
which
lined
the
floor
“Why
dear
me
it
sounds
quite
hollow
he
remarked
looking
up
in
surprise
“I
must
really
ask
you
to
be
little
more
quiet
said
holmes
severely
“You
have
already
imperilled
the
whole
success
of
our
expedition
might
beg
that
you
would
have
the
goodness
to
sit
down
upon
one
of
those
boxes
and
not
to
interfere
the
solemn
mr
merryweather
perched
himself
upon
crate
with
very
injured
expression
upon
his
face
while
holmes
fell
upon
his
knees
upon
the
floor
and
with
the
lantern
and
magnifying
lens
began
to
examine
minutely
the
cracks
between
the
stones
few
seconds
sufficed
to
satisfy
him
for
he
sprang
to
his
feet
again
and
put
his
glass
in
his
pocket
“We
have
at
least
an
hour
before
us
he
remarked
“for
they
can
hardly
take
any
steps
until
the
good
pawnbroker
is
safely
in
bed
then
they
will
not
lose
minute
for
the
sooner
they
do
their
work
the
longer
time
they
will
have
for
their
escape
we
are
at
present
doctor
as
no
doubt
you
have
divined
in
the
cellar
of
the
city
branch
of
one
of
the
principal
london
banks
mr
merryweather
is
the
chairman
of
directors
and
he
will
explain
to
you
that
there
are
reasons
why
the
more
daring
criminals
of
london
should
take
considerable
interest
in
this
cellar
at
present
“It
is
our
french
gold
whispered
the
director
“We
have
had
several
warnings
that
an
attempt
might
be
made
upon
it
“Your
french
gold
“Yes
we
had
occasion
some
months
ago
to
strengthen
our
resources
and
borrowed
for
that
purpose
30
000
napoleons
from
the
bank
of
france
it
has
become
known
that
we
have
never
had
occasion
to
unpack
the
money
and
that
it
is
still
lying
in
our
cellar
the
crate
upon
which
sit
contains
000
napoleons
packed
between
layers
of
lead
foil
our
reserve
of
bullion
is
much
larger
at
present
than
is
usually
kept
in
single
branch
office
and
the
directors
have
had
misgivings
upon
the
subject
“Which
were
very
well
justified
observed
holmes
“And
now
it
is
time
that
we
arranged
our
little
plans
expect
that
within
an
hour
matters
will
come
to
head
in
the
meantime
mr
merryweather
we
must
put
the
screen
over
that
dark
lantern
“And
sit
in
the
dark
“I
am
afraid
so
had
brought
pack
of
cards
in
my
pocket
and
thought
that
as
we
were
partie
carrée
you
might
have
your
rubber
after
all
but
see
that
the
enemy’s
preparations
have
gone
so
far
that
we
cannot
risk
the
presence
of
light
and
first
of
all
we
must
choose
our
positions
these
are
daring
men
and
though
we
shall
take
them
at
disadvantage
they
may
do
us
some
harm
unless
we
are
careful
shall
stand
behind
this
crate
and
do
you
conceal
yourselves
behind
those
then
when
flash
light
upon
them
close
in
swiftly
if
they
fire
watson
have
no
compunction
about
shooting
them
down
placed
my
revolver
cocked
upon
the
top
of
the
wooden
case
behind
which
crouched
holmes
shot
the
slide
across
the
front
of
his
lantern
and
left
us
in
pitch
darkness
such
an
absolute
darkness
as
have
never
before
experienced
the
smell
of
hot
metal
remained
to
assure
us
that
the
light
was
still
there
ready
to
flash
out
at
moment’s
notice
to
me
with
my
nerves
worked
up
to
pitch
of
expectancy
there
was
something
depressing
and
subduing
in
the
sudden
gloom
and
in
the
cold
dank
air
of
the
vault
“They
have
but
one
retreat
whispered
holmes
“That
is
back
through
the

you
have
done

“I
have
an

“Then
we
have
stopped
all
the
holes
and
now
we
must
be
silent
and
wait
what
time
it
seemed
from
comparing
notes
afterwards
it
was
but
an
hour
and
quarter
yet
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
night
must
have
almost
gone
and
the
dawn
be
breaking
above
us
my
limbs
were
weary
and
stiff
for
feared
to
change
my
position
yet
my
nerves
were
worked
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
tension
and
my
hearing
was
so
acute
that
could
not
only
hear
the
gentle
breathing
of
my
companions
but
could
distinguish
the
deeper
heavier
in
breath
of
the
bulky
jones
from
the
thin
sighing
note
of
the
bank
director
from
my
position
could
look
over
the
case
in
the
direction
of
the
floor
suddenly
my
eyes
caught
the
glint
of
light
at
first
it
was
but
lurid
spark
upon
the
stone
pavement
then
it
lengthened
out
until
it
became
yellow
line
and
then
without
any
warning
or
sound
gash
seemed
to
open
and
hand
appeared
white
almost
womanly
hand
which
felt
about
in
the
centre
of
the
little
area
of
light
for
minute
or
more
the
hand
with
its
writhing
fingers
protruded
out
of
the
floor
then
it
was
withdrawn
as
suddenly
as
it
appeared
and
all
was
dark
again
save
the
single
lurid
spark
which
marked
chink
between
the
stones
its
disappearance
however
was
but
momentary
with
rending
tearing
sound
one
of
the
broad
white
stones
turned
over
upon
its
side
and
left
square
gaping
hole
through
which
streamed
the
light
of
lantern
over
the
edge
there
peeped
clean
cut
boyish
face
which
looked
keenly
about
it
and
then
with
hand
on
either
side
of
the
aperture
drew
itself
shoulder
high
and
waist
high
until
one
knee
rested
upon
the
edge
in
another
instant
he
stood
at
the
side
of
the
hole
and
was
hauling
after
him
companion
lithe
and
small
like
himself
with
pale
face
and
shock
of
very
red
hair
“It’s
all
clear
he
whispered
“Have
you
the
chisel
and
the
bags

for

sherlock
holmes
had
sprung
out
and
seized
the
intruder
by
the
collar
the
other
dived
down
the
hole
and
heard
the
sound
of
rending
cloth
as
jones
clutched
at
his
skirts
the
light
flashed
upon
the
barrel
of
revolver
but
holmes’
hunting
crop
came
down
on
the
man’s
wrist
and
the
pistol
clinked
upon
the
stone
floor
“It’s
no
use
john
clay
said
holmes
blandly
“You

answered
with
the
utmost
coolness
“I
fancy
that
my

is
all
right
though
see
you
have
got
his

“There
are
three
men
waiting
for
him
at
the
door

holmes
“Oh
indeed
you
seem
to
have
done
the
thing
very
completely
must
compliment
you
“And
you
holmes
answered
“Your
red
headed
idea
was
very
new
and
effective
“You’ll
see
your
pal
again
presently
said
jones
“He’s
quicker
at
climbing
down
holes
than

out

“I
beg
that
you
will
not
touch
me
with
your
filthy
hands
remarked
our
prisoner
as
the
handcuffs
clattered
upon
his
wrists
“You
may
not
be
aware
that
have
royal
blood
in
my
veins
have
the
goodness
also
when
you
address
me
always
to
say
‘sir’
and
‘please
“All
right
said
jones
with
stare
and
snigger
“Well
would
you
please
sir
march
upstairs
where
we
can
get
cab
to
carry
your
highness
to
the
police
station
“That
is
better
said
john
clay
serenely
he
made
sweeping
bow
to
the
three
of
us
and
walked
quietly
off
in
the
custody
of
the
detective
“Really
mr
holmes
said
mr
merryweather
as
we
followed
them
from
the
cellar
“I
do
not
know
how
the
bank
can
thank
you
or
repay
you
there
is
no
doubt
that
you
have
detected
and
defeated
in
the
most
complete
manner
one
of
the
most
determined
attempts
at
bank
robbery
that
have
ever
come
within
my
experience
“I
have
had
one
or
two
little
scores
of
my
own
to
settle
with
mr
john
clay
said
holmes
“I
have
been
at
some
small
expense
over
this
matter
which
shall
expect
the
bank
to
refund
but
beyond
that
am
amply
repaid
by
having
had
an
experience
which
is
in
many
ways
unique
and
by
hearing
the
very
remarkable
narrative
of
the
red
headed
league
“You
see
watson
he
explained
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
as
we
sat
over
glass
of
whisky
and
soda
in
baker
street
“it
was
perfectly
obvious
from
the
first
that
the
only
possible
object
of
this
rather
fantastic
business
of
the
advertisement
of
the
league
and
the
copying
of
the
encyclopaedia
must
be
to
get
this
not
over
bright
pawnbroker
out
of
the
way
for
number
of
hours
every
day
it
was
curious
way
of
managing
it
but
really
it
would
be
difficult
to
suggest
better
the
method
was
no
doubt
suggested
to
clay’s
ingenious
mind
by
the
colour
of
his
accomplice’s
hair
the
£4
week
was
lure
which
must
draw
him
and
what
was
it
to
them
who
were
playing
for
thousands
they
put
in
the
advertisement
one
rogue
has
the
temporary
office
the
other
rogue
incites
the
man
to
apply
for
it
and
together
they
manage
to
secure
his
absence
every
morning
in
the
week
from
the
time
that
heard
of
the
assistant
having
come
for
half
wages
it
was
obvious
to
me
that
he
had
some
strong
motive
for
securing
the
situation
“But
how
could
you
guess
what
the
motive
was
“Had
there
been
women
in
the
house
should
have
suspected
mere
vulgar
intrigue
that
however
was
out
of
the
question
the
man’s
business
was
small
one
and
there
was
nothing
in
his
house
which
could
account
for
such
elaborate
preparations
and
such
an
expenditure
as
they
were
at
it
must
then
be
something
out
of
the
house
what
could
it
be
thought
of
the
assistant’s
fondness
for
photography
and
his
trick
of
vanishing
into
the
cellar
the
cellar
there
was
the
end
of
this
tangled
clue
then
made
inquiries
as
to
this
mysterious
assistant
and
found
that
had
to
deal
with
one
of
the
coolest
and
most
daring
criminals
in
london
he
was
doing
something
in
the
cellar
something
which
took
many
hours
day
for
months
on
end
what
could
it
be
once
more
could
think
of
nothing
save
that
he
was
running
tunnel
to
some
other
building
“So
far
had
got
when
we
went
to
visit
the
scene
of
action
surprised
you
by
beating
upon
the
pavement
with
my
stick
was
ascertaining
whether
the
cellar
stretched
out
in
front
or
behind
it
was
not
in
front
then
rang
the
bell
and
as
hoped
the
assistant
answered
it
we
have
had
some
skirmishes
but
we
had
never
set
eyes
upon
each
other
before
hardly
looked
at
his
face
his
knees
were
what
wished
to
see
you
must
yourself
have
remarked
how
worn
wrinkled
and
stained
they
were
they
spoke
of
those
hours
of
burrowing
the
only
remaining
point
was
what
they
were
burrowing
for
walked
round
the
corner
saw
the
city
and
suburban
bank
abutted
on
our
friend’s
premises
and
felt
that
had
solved
my
problem
when
you
drove
home
after
the
concert
called
upon
scotland
yard
and
upon
the
chairman
of
the
bank
directors
with
the
result
that
you
have
seen
“And
how
could
you
tell
that
they
would
make
their
attempt
to
night
asked
“Well
when
they
closed
their
league
offices
that
was
sign
that
they
cared
no
longer
about
mr
jabez
wilson’s
presence
in
other
words
that
they
had
completed
their
tunnel
but
it
was
essential
that
they
should
use
it
soon
as
it
might
be
discovered
or
the
bullion
might
be
removed
saturday
would
suit
them
better
than
any
other
day
as
it
would
give
them
two
days
for
their
escape
for
all
these
reasons
expected
them
to
come
to
night
“You
reasoned
it
out
beautifully
exclaimed
in
unfeigned
admiration
“It
is
so
long
chain
and
yet
every
link
rings
true
“It
saved
me
from
ennui
he
answered
yawning
“Alas
already
feel
it
closing
in
upon
me
my
life
is
spent
in
one
long
effort
to
escape
from
the
commonplaces
of
existence
these
little
problems
help
me
to
do
so
“And
you
are
benefactor
of
the
race
said
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
“Well
perhaps
after
all
it
is
of
some
little
use

“My
dear
fellow
said
sherlock
holmes
as
we
sat
on
either
side
of
the
fire
in
his
lodgings
at
baker
street
“life
is
infinitely
stranger
than
anything
which
the
mind
of
man
could
invent
we
would
not
dare
to
conceive
the
things

are
really
mere
commonplaces
of
existence
if
we
could
fly
out
of
that
window

in

over
this
great
city

remove
the
roofs

peep
in
at
the
queer

cross

wonderful
chains

leading
to

most
outré
results
it
would
make
all

with
its
conventionalities
and
foreseen
conclusions
most
stale
and
unprofitable
“And
yet
am
not
convinced
of
it
answered
“The
cases

come
to
light
in
the
papers
are
as
rule
bald
enough

vulgar
enough
we
have
in

police
reports

pushed
to
its
extreme
limits
and
yet
the
result
is
it
must
be
confessed
neither
fascinating
nor
artistic
“A
certain
selection
and
discretion
must
be
used
in
producing
realistic
effect
remarked
holmes
“This
is
wanting
in
the
police
report
where
more
stress
is
laid
perhaps
upon
the
platitudes
of
the
magistrate
than
upon
the
details

to
an
observer
contain
the
vital
essence

whole

there
is
nothing

and
shook
my
head

risen
from

was
standing
between

gazing
down
into

looking
over

that
on

stood

with

round
her

was
tilted

fashion
over

from
under

great
panoply
she
peeped
up
in
nervous
hesitating
fashion
at
our
windows
while
her
body
oscillated
backward

forward
and
her
fingers
fidgeted
with
her
glove

suddenly
with
plunge
as
of
the
swimmer

leaves

hurried
across

we
heard
the
sharp
clang

would
like

with
the

courtesy
for

having
closed

bowed

into

looked
her
over
in

minute
and

abstracted

was

you
come
to
consult
me
“I
came
to
you
sir
because
heard
of
you
from
mrs
etherege
whose
husband
you
found
so
easy
when
the
police
and
everyone
had
given
him
up
for
dead
oh
mr
holmes
wish
you
would
do
as
much
for
me
i’m
not
rich
but
still
have
hundred
year
in
my
own
right
besides
the
little
that
make
by
the
machine
and
would
give
it
all
to
know
what
has
become
of
mr
hosmer
angel
“Why
did
you
come
away
to
consult
me
in
such
hurry
asked
sherlock
holmes
with
his
finger
tips
together
and
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
again
startled
look
came
over
the
somewhat
vacuous
face
of
miss
mary
sutherland
“Yes
did
bang
out
of
the
house
she
said
“for
it
made
me
angry
to
see
the
easy
way
in
which
mr
windibank
that
is
my
father
took
it
all
he
would
not
go
to
the
police
and
he
would
not
go
to
you
and
so
at
last
as
he
would
do
nothing
and
kept
on
saying
that
there
was
no
harm
done
it
made
me
mad
and
just
on
with
my
things
and
came
right
away
to
you
“Your
father
said
holmes
“your
stepfather
surely
since
the
name
is
different
“Yes
my
stepfather
call
him
father
though
it
sounds
funny
too
for
he
is
only
five
years
and
two
months
older
than
myself
“And
your
mother
is
alive
“Oh
yes
mother
is
alive
and
well
wasn’t
best
pleased
mr
holmes
when
she
married
again
so
soon
after
father’s
death
and
man
who
was
nearly
fifteen
years
younger
than
herself
father
was
plumber
in
the
tottenham
court
road
and
he
left
tidy
business
behind
him
which
mother
carried
on
with
mr
hardy
the
foreman
but
when
mr
windibank
came
he
made
her
sell
the
business
for
he
was
very
superior
being
traveller
in
wines
they
got
£4700
for
the
goodwill
and
interest
which
wasn’t
near
as
much
as
father
could
have
got
if
he
had
been
alive
had
expected
to
see
sherlock
holmes
impatient
under
this
rambling
and
inconsequential
narrative
but
on
the
contrary
he
had
listened
with
the
greatest
concentration
of
attention
“Your
own
little
income
he
asked
“does
it
come
out
of
the
business
“Oh
no
sir
it
is
quite
separate
and
was
left
me
by
my
uncle
ned
in
auckland
it
is
in
new
zealand
stock
paying
4½
per
cent
two
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
was
the
amount
but
can
only
touch
the
interest
“You
interest
me
extremely
said
holmes
“And
since
you
draw
so
large
sum
as
hundred
year
with
what
you
earn
into
the
bargain
you
no
doubt
travel
little
and
indulge
yourself
in
every
way
believe
that
single
lady
can
get
on
very
nicely
upon
an
income
of
about
£60
“I
could
do
with
much
less
than
that
mr
holmes
but
you
understand
that
as
long
as
live
at
home
don’t
wish
to
be
burden
to
them
and
so
they
have
the
use
of
the
money
just
while
am
staying
with
them
of
course
that
is
only
just
for
the
time
mr
windibank
draws
my
interest
every
quarter
and
pays
it
over
to
mother
and
find
that
can
do
pretty
well
with
what
earn
at
typewriting
it
brings
me
twopence
sheet
and
can
often
do
from
fifteen
to
twenty
sheets
in
day
“You
have
made
your
position
very
clear
to
me
said
holmes
“This
is
my
friend
dr
watson
before
whom
you
can
speak
as
freely
as
before
myself
kindly
tell
us
now
all
about
your
connection
with
mr
hosmer
angel
flush
stole
over
miss
sutherland’s
face
and
she
picked
nervously
at
the
fringe
of
her
jacket
“I
met
him
first
at
the
gasfitters’
ball
she
said
“They
used
to
send
father
tickets
when
he
was
alive
and
then
afterwards
they
remembered
us
and
sent
them
to
mother
mr
windibank
did
not
wish
us
to
go
he
never
did
wish
us
to
go
anywhere
he
would
get
quite
mad
if
wanted
so
much
as
to
join
sunday
school
treat
but
this
time
was
set
on
going
and
would
go
for
what
right
had
he
to
prevent
he
said
the
folk
were
not
fit
for
us
to
know
when
all
father’s
friends
were
to
be
there
and
he
said
that
had
nothing
fit
to
wear
when
had
my
purple
plush
that
had
never
so
much
as
taken
out
of
the
drawer
at
last
when
nothing
else
would
do
he
went
off
to
france
upon
the
business
of
the
firm
but
we
went
mother
and
with
mr
hardy
who
used
to
be
our
foreman
and
it
was
there
met
mr
hosmer
angel
“I
suppose
said
holmes
“that
when
mr
windibank
came
back
from
france
he
was
very
annoyed
at
your
having
gone
to
the
ball
“Oh
well
he
was
very
good
about
it
he
laughed
remember
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
there
was
no
use
denying
anything
to
woman
for
she
would
have
her
way
“I
see
then
at
the
gasfitters’
ball
you
met
as
understand
gentleman
called
mr
hosmer
angel
“Yes
sir
met
him
that
night
and
he
called
next
day
to
ask
if
we
had
got
home
all
safe
and
after
that
we
met
him
that
is
to
say
mr
holmes
met
him
twice
for
walks
but
after
that
father
came
back
again
and
mr
hosmer
angel
could
not
come
to
the
house
any
more
“No
“Well
you
know
father
didn’t
like
anything
of
the
sort
he
wouldn’t
have
any
visitors
if
he
could
help
it
and
he
used
to
say
that
woman
should
be
happy
in
her
own
family
circle
but
then
as
used
to
say
to
mother
woman
wants
her
own
circle
to
begin
with
and
had
not
got
mine
yet
“But
how
about
mr
hosmer
angel
did
he
make
no
attempt
to
see
you
“Well
father
was
going
off
to
france
again
in
week
and
hosmer
wrote
and
said
that
it
would
be
safer
and
better
not
to
see
each
other
until
he
had
gone
we
could
write
in
the
meantime
and
he
used
to
write
every
day
took
the
letters
in
the
morning
so
there
was
no
need
for
father
to
know

“Were
you
engaged
to
the
gentleman
at
this
time
“Oh
yes
mr
holmes
we
were
engaged
after
the
first
walk
that
we
took
hosmer
mr
angel
was
cashier
in
an
office
in
leadenhall
street
and—”
“What
office
“That’s
the
worst
of
it
mr
holmes
don’t
know
“Where
did
he
live
then
“He
slept
on
the
premises
“And
you
don’t
know
his
address
“No
except
that
it
was
leadenhall
street
“Where
did
you
address
your
letters
then
“To
the
leadenhall
street
post
office
to
be
left
till
called
for
he
said
that
if
they
were
sent
to
the
office
he
would
be
chaffed
by
all
the
other
clerks
about
having
letters
from
lady
so
offered
to
typewrite
them
like
he
did
his
but
he
wouldn’t
have
that
for
he
said
that
when
wrote
them
they
seemed
to
come
from
me
but
when
they
were
typewritten
he
always
felt
that
the
machine
had
come
between
us
that
will
just
show
you
how
fond
he
was
of
me
mr
holmes
and
the
little
things
that
he
would
think
of
“It
was
most
suggestive
said
holmes
“It
has
long
been
an
axiom
of
mine
that
the
little
things
are
infinitely
the
most
important
can
you
remember
any
other
little
things
about
mr
hosmer
angel
“He
was
very
shy
man
mr
holmes
he
would
rather
walk
with
me
in
the
evening
than
in
the
daylight
for
he
said
that
he
hated
to
be
conspicuous
very
retiring
and
gentlemanly
he
was
even
his
voice
was
gentle
he’d
had
the
quinsy
and
swollen
glands
when
he
was
young
he
told
me
and
it
had
left
him
with
weak
throat
and
hesitating
whispering
fashion
of
speech
he
was
always
well
dressed
very
neat
and
plain
but
his
eyes
were
weak
just
as
mine
are
and
he
wore
tinted
glasses
against
the
glare
“Well
and
what
happened
when
mr
windibank
your
stepfather
returned
to
france
“Mr
hosmer
angel
came
to
the
house
again
and
proposed
that
we
should
marry
before
father
came
back
he
was
in
dreadful
earnest
and
made
me
swear
with
my
hands
on
the
testament
that
whatever
happened
would
always
be
true
to
him
mother
said
he
was
quite
right
to
make
me
swear
and
that
it
was
sign
of
his
passion
mother
was
all
in
his
favour
from
the
first
and
was
even
fonder
of
him
than
was
then
when
they
talked
of
marrying
within
the
week
began
to
ask
about
father
but
they
both
said
never
to
mind
about
father
but
just
to
tell
him
afterwards
and
mother
said
she
would
make
it
all
right
with
him
didn’t
quite
like
that
mr
holmes
it
seemed
funny
that
should
ask
his
leave
as
he
was
only
few
years
older
than
me
but
didn’t
want
to
do
anything
on
the
sly
so
wrote
to
father
at
bordeaux
where
the
company
has
its
french
offices
but
the
letter
came
back
to
me
on
the
very
morning
of
the
wedding
“It
missed
him
then
“Yes
sir
for
he
had
started
to
england
just
before
it
arrived
“Ha
that
was
unfortunate
your
wedding
was
arranged
then
for
the
friday
was
it
to
be
in
church
“Yes
sir
but
very
quietly
it
was
to
be
at
st
saviour’s
near
king’s
cross
and
we
were
to
have
breakfast
afterwards
at
the
st
pancras
hotel
hosmer
came
for
us
in
hansom
but
as
there
were
two
of
us
he
put
us
both
into
it
and
stepped
himself
into
four
wheeler
which
happened
to
be
the
only
other
cab
in
the
street
we
got
to
the
church
first
and
when
the
four
wheeler
drove
up
we
waited
for
him
to
step
out
but
he
never
did
and
when
the
cabman
got
down
from
the
box
and
looked
there
was
no
one
there
the
cabman
said
that
he
could
not
imagine
what
had
become
of
him
for
he
had
seen
him
get
in
with
his
own
eyes
that
was
last
friday
mr
holmes
and
have
never
seen
or
heard
anything
since
then
to
throw
any
light
upon
what
became
of
him
“It
seems
to
me
that
you
have
been
very
shamefully
treated
said
holmes
“Oh
no
sir
he
was
too
good
and
kind
to
leave
me
so
why
all
the
morning
he
was
saying
to
me
that
whatever
happened
was
to
be
true
and
that
even
if
something
quite
unforeseen
occurred
to
separate
us
was
always
to
remember
that
was
pledged
to
him
and
that
he
would
claim
his
pledge
sooner
or
later
it
seemed
strange
talk
for
wedding
morning
but
what
has
happened
since
gives
meaning
to
it
“Most
certainly
it
does
your
own
opinion
is
then
that
some
unforeseen
catastrophe
has
occurred
to
him
“Yes
sir
believe
that
he
foresaw
some
danger
or
else
he
would
not
have
talked
so
and
then
think
that
what
he
foresaw
happened
“But
you
have
no
notion
as
to
what
it
could
have
been
“None
“One
more
question
how
did
your
mother
take
the
matter
“She
was
angry
and
said
that
was
never
to
speak
of
the
matter
again
“And
your
father
did
you
tell
him
“Yes
and
he
seemed
to
think
with
me
that
something
had
happened
and
that
should
hear
of
hosmer
again
as
he
said
what
interest
could
anyone
have
in
bringing
me
to
the
doors
of
the
church
and
then
leaving
me
now
if
he
had
borrowed
my
money
or
if
he
had
married
me
and
got
my
money
settled
on
him
there
might
be
some
reason
but
hosmer
was
very
independent
about
money
and
never
would
look
at
shilling
of
mine
and
yet
what
could
have
happened
and
why
could
he
not
write
oh
it
drives
me
half
mad
to
think
of
it
and
can’t
sleep
wink
at
night
she
pulled
little
handkerchief
out
of
her
muff
and
began
to
sob
heavily
into
it
“I
shall
glance
into
the
case
for
you
said
holmes
rising
“and
have
no
doubt
that
we
shall
reach
some
definite
result
let
the
weight
of
the
matter
rest
upon
me
now
and
do
not
let
your
mind
dwell
upon
it
further
above
all
try
to
let
mr
hosmer
angel
vanish
from
your
memory
as
he
has
done
from
your
life
“Then
you
don’t
think
i’ll
see
him
again
“I
fear
not
“Then
what
has
happened
to
him
“You
will
leave
that
question
in
my
hands
should
like
an
accurate
description
of
him
and
any
letters
of
his
which
you
can
spare
“I
advertised
for
him
in
last
saturday’s
chronicle
said
she
“Here
is
the
slip
and
here
are
four
letters
from
him
“Thank
you
and
your
address
“No
31
lyon
place
camberwell
“Mr
angel’s
address
you
never
had
understand
where
is
your
father’s
place
of
business
“He
travels
for
westhouse
marbank
the
great
claret
importers
of
fenchurch
street
“Thank
you
have
made
your
statement
very
clearly
you
will
leave
the
papers
here
and
remember
the
advice
which
have
given
you
let
the
whole
incident
be
sealed
book
and
do
not
allow
it
to
affect
your
life
“You
are
very
kind
mr
holmes
but
cannot
do
that
shall
be
true
to
hosmer
he
shall
find
me
ready
when
he
comes
back
for
all
the
preposterous
hat
and
the
vacuous
face
there
was
something
noble
in
the
simple
faith
of
our
visitor
which
compelled
our
respect
she
laid
her
little
bundle
of
papers
upon
the
table
and
went
her
way
with
promise
to
come
again
whenever
she
might
be
summoned
sherlock
holmes
sat
silent
for
few
minutes
with
his
fingertips
still
pressed
together
his
legs
stretched
out
in
front
of
him
and
his
gaze
directed
upward
to
the
ceiling
then
he
took
down
from
the
rack
the
old
and
oily
clay
pipe
which
was
to
him
as
counsellor
and
having
lit
it
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
the
thick
blue
cloud
wreaths
spinning
up
from
him
and
look
of
infinite
languor
in
his
face
“Quite
an
interesting
study
that
maiden
he
observed
“I
found
her
more
interesting
than
her
little
problem
which
by
the
way
is
rather
trite
one
you
will
find
parallel
cases
if
you
consult
my
index
in
andover
in
’77
and
there
was
something
of
the
sort
at
the
hague
last
year
old
as
is
the
idea
however
there
were
one
or
two
details
which
were
new
to
me
but
the
maiden
herself
was
most
instructive
“You
appeared
to
read
good
deal
upon
her
which
was
quite
invisible
to
me
remarked
“Not
invisible
but
unnoticed
watson
you
did
not
know
where
to
look
and
so
you
missed
all
that
was
important
can
never
bring
you
to
realise
the
importance
of
sleeves
the
suggestiveness
of
thumb
nails
or
the
great
issues
that
may
hang
from
boot
lace
now
what
did
you
gather
from
that
woman’s
appearance
describe
it
“Well
she
had
slate
coloured
broad
brimmed
straw
hat
with
feather
of
brickish
red
her
jacket
was
black
with
black
beads
sewn
upon
it
and
fringe
of
little
black
jet
ornaments
her
dress
was
brown
rather
darker
than
coffee
colour
with
little
purple
plush
at
the
neck
and
sleeves
her
gloves
were
greyish
and
were
worn
through
at
the
right
forefinger
her
boots
didn’t
observe
she
had
small
round
hanging
gold
earrings
and
general
air
of
being
fairly
well
to
do
in
vulgar
comfortable
easy
going
way
sherlock
holmes
clapped
his
hands
softly
together
and
chuckled

’Pon
my
word
watson
you
are
coming
along
wonderfully
you
have
really
done
very
well
indeed
it
is
true
that
you
have
missed
everything
of
importance
but
you
have
hit
upon
the
method
and
you
have
quick
eye
for
colour
never
trust
to
general
impressions
my
boy
but
concentrate
yourself
upon
details
my
first
glance
is
always
at
woman’s
sleeve
in
man
it
is
perhaps
better
first
to
take
the
knee
of
the
trouser
as
you
observe
this
woman
had
plush
upon
her
sleeves
which
is
most
useful
material
for
showing
traces
the
double
line
little
above
the
wrist
where
the
typewritist
presses
against
the
table
was
beautifully
defined
the
sewing
machine
of
the
hand
type
leaves
similar
mark
but
only
on
the
left
arm
and
on
the
side
of
it
farthest
from
the
thumb
instead
of
being
right
across
the
broadest
part
as
this
was
then
glanced
at
her
face
and
observing
the
dint
of
pince
nez
at
either
side
of
her
nose
ventured
remark
upon
short
sight
and
typewriting
which
seemed
to
surprise
her
“It
surprised
me
“But
surely
it
was
obvious
was
then
much
surprised
and
interested
on
glancing
down
to
observe
that
though
the
boots
which
she
was
wearing
were
not
unlike
each
other
they
were
really
odd
ones
the
one
having
slightly
decorated
toe
cap
and
the
other
plain
one
was
buttoned
only
in
the
two
lower
buttons
out
of
five
and
the
other
at
the
first
third
and
fifth
now
when
you
see
that
young
lady
otherwise
neatly
dressed
has
come
away
from
home
with
odd
boots
half
buttoned
it
is
no
great
deduction
to
say
that
she
came
away
in
hurry
“And
what
else
asked
keenly
interested
as
always
was
by
my
friend’s
incisive
reasoning
“I
noted
in
passing
that
she
had
written
note
before
leaving
home
but
after
being
fully
dressed
you
observed
that
her
right
glove
was
torn
at
the
forefinger
but
you
did
not
apparently
see
that
both
glove
and
finger
were
stained
with
violet
ink
she
had
written
in
hurry
and
dipped
her
pen
too
deep
it
must
have
been
this
morning
or
the
mark
would
not
remain
clear
upon
the
finger
all
this
is
amusing
though
rather
elementary
but
must
go
back
to
business
watson
would
you
mind
reading
me
the
advertised
description
of
mr
hosmer
angel
held
the
little
printed
slip
to
the
light
“Missing
it
said
“on
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
gentleman
named
hosmer
angel
about
five
ft
seven
in
height
strongly
built
sallow
complexion
black
hair
little
bald
in
the
centre
bushy
black
side
whiskers
and
moustache
tinted
glasses
slight
infirmity
of
speech
was
dressed
when
last
seen
in
black
frock
coat
faced
with
silk
black
waistcoat
gold
albert
chain
and
grey
harris
tweed
trousers
with
brown
gaiters
over
elastic
sided
boots
known
to
have
been
employed
in
an
office
in
leadenhall
street
anybody
bringing—”
“That
will
do
said
holmes
“As
to
the
letters
he
continued
glancing
over
them
“they
are
very
commonplace
absolutely
no
clue
in
them
to
mr
angel
save
that
he
quotes
balzac
once
there
is
one
remarkable
point
however
which
will
no
doubt
strike
you
“They
are
typewritten
remarked
“Not
only
that
but
the
signature
is
typewritten
look
at
the
neat
little
‘Hosmer
angel’
at
the
bottom
there
is
date
you
see
but
no
superscription
except
leadenhall
street
which
is
rather
vague
the
point
about
the
signature
is
very
suggestive
in
fact
we
may
call
it
conclusive
“Of
what
“My
dear
fellow
is
it
possible
you
do
not
see
how
strongly
it
bears
upon
the
case
“I
cannot
say
that
do
unless
it
were
that
he
wished
to
be
able
to
deny
his
signature
if
an
action
for
breach
of
promise
were
instituted
“No
that
was
not
the
point
however
shall
write
two
letters
which
should
settle
the
matter
one
is
to
firm
in
the
city
the
other
is
to
the
young
lady’s
stepfather
mr
windibank
asking
him
whether
he
could
meet
us
here
at
six
o’clock
to
morrow
evening
it
is
just
as
well
that
we
should
do
business
with
the
male
relatives
and
now
doctor
we
can
do
nothing
until
the
answers
to
those
letters
come
so
we
may
put
our
little
problem
upon
the
shelf
for
the
interim
had
so
many
reasons
to
believe
in
my
friend’s
subtle
powers
of
reasoning
and
extraordinary
energy
in
action
that
felt
that
he
must
have
some
solid
grounds
for
the
assured
and
easy
demeanour
with
which
he
treated
the
singular
mystery
which
he
had
been
called
upon
to
fathom
once
only
had
known
him
to
fail
in
the
case
of
the
king
of
bohemia
and
of
the
irene
adler
photograph
but
when
looked
back
to
the
weird
business
of
the
sign
of
four
and
the
extraordinary
circumstances
connected
with
the
study
in
scarlet
felt
that
it
would
be
strange
tangle
indeed
which
he
could
not
unravel
left
him
then
still
puffing
at
his
black
clay
pipe
with
the
conviction
that
when
came
again
on
the
next
evening
would
find
that
he
held
in
his
hands
all
the
clues
which
would
lead
up
to
the
identity
of
the
disappearing
bridegroom
of
miss
mary
sutherland
professional
case
of
great
gravity
was
engaging
my
own
attention
at
the
time
and
the
whole
of
next
day
was
busy
at
the
bedside
of
the
sufferer
it
was
not
until
close
upon
six
o’clock
that
found
myself
free
and
was
able
to
spring
into
hansom
and
drive
to
baker
street
half
afraid
that
might
be
too
late
to
assist
at
the
dénouement
of
the
little
mystery
found
sherlock
holmes
alone
however
half
asleep
with
his
long
thin
form
curled
up
in
the
recesses
of
his
armchair
formidable
array
of
bottles
and
test
tubes
with
the
pungent
cleanly
smell
of
hydrochloric
acid
told
me
that
he
had
spent
his
day
in
the
chemical
work
which
was
so
dear
to
him
“Well
have
you
solved
it
asked
as
entered
“Yes
it
was
the
bisulphate
of
baryta
“No
no
the
mystery
cried
“Oh
that
thought
of
the
salt
that
have
been
working
upon
there
was
never
any
mystery
in
the
matter
though
as
said
yesterday
some
of
the
details
are
of
interest
the
only
drawback
is
that
there
is
no
law
fear
that
can
touch
the
scoundrel
“Who
was
he
then
and
what
was
his
object
in
deserting
miss
sutherland
the
question
was
hardly
out
of
my
mouth
and
holmes
had
not
yet
opened
his
lips
to
reply
when
we
heard
heavy
footfall
in
the
passage
and
tap
at
the
door
“This
is
the
girl’s
stepfather
mr
james
windibank
said
holmes
“He
has
written
to
me
to
say
that
he
would
be
here
at
six
come
in
the
man
who
entered
was
sturdy
middle
sized
fellow
some
thirty
years
of
age
clean
shaven
and
sallow
skinned
with
bland
insinuating
manner
and
pair
of
wonderfully
sharp
and
penetrating
grey
eyes
he
shot
questioning
glance
at
each
of
us
placed
his
shiny
top
hat
upon
the
sideboard
and
with
slight
bow
sidled
down
into
the
nearest
chair
“Good
evening
mr
james
windibank
said
holmes
“I
think
that
this
typewritten
letter
is
from
you
in
which
you
made
an
appointment
with
me
for
six
o’clock
“Yes
sir
am
afraid
that
am
little
late
but
am
not
quite
my
own
master
you
know
am
sorry
that
miss
sutherland
has
troubled
you
about
this
little
matter
for
think
it
is
far
better
not
to
wash
linen
of
the
sort
in
public
it
was
quite
against
my
wishes
that
she
came
but
she
is
very
excitable
impulsive
girl
as
you
may
have
noticed
and
she
is
not
easily
controlled
when
she
has
made
up
her
mind
on
point
of
course
did
not
mind
you
so
much
as
you
are
not
connected
with
the
official
police
but
it
is
not
pleasant
to
have
family
misfortune
like
this
noised
abroad
besides
it
is
useless
expense
for
how
could
you
possibly
find
this
hosmer
angel
“On
the
contrary
said
holmes
quietly
“I
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
will
succeed
in
discovering
mr
hosmer
angel
mr
windibank
gave
violent
start
and
dropped
his
gloves
“I
am
delighted
to
hear
it
he
said
“It
is
curious
thing
remarked
holmes
“that
typewriter
has
really
quite
as
much
individuality
as
man’s
handwriting
unless
they
are
quite
new
no
two
of
them
write
exactly
alike
some
letters
get
more
worn
than
others
and
some
wear
only
on
one
side
now
you
remark
in
this
note
of
yours
mr
windibank
that
in
every
case
there
is
some
little
slurring
over
of
the
‘e
and
slight
defect
in
the
tail
of
the
‘r
there
are
fourteen
other
characteristics
but
those
are
the
more
obvious
“We
do
all
our
correspondence
with
this
machine
at
the
office
and
no
doubt
it
is
little
worn
our
visitor
answered
glancing
keenly
at
holmes
with
his
bright
little
eyes
“And
now
will
show
you
what
is
really
very
interesting
study
mr
windibank
holmes
continued
“I
think
of
writing
another
little
monograph
some
of
these
days
on
the
typewriter
and
its
relation
to
crime
it
is
subject
to
which
have
devoted
some
little
attention
have
here
four
letters
which
purport
to
come
from
the
missing
man
they
are
all
typewritten
in
each
case
not
only
are
the
‘e’s’
slurred
and
the
‘r’s’
tailless
but
you
will
observe
if
you
care
to
use
my
magnifying
lens
that
the
fourteen
other
characteristics
to
which
have
alluded
are
there
as
well

mr
windibank
sprang
out
of
his
chair
and
picked
up
his
hat
“I
cannot
waste
time
over
this
sort
of
fantastic
talk
mr
holmes
he
said
“If
you
can
catch
the
man
catch
him
and
let
me
know
when
you
have
done
it
“Certainly
said
holmes
stepping
over
and
turning
the
key
in
the
door
“I
let
you
know
then
that
have
caught
him
“What
where
shouted
mr
windibank
turning
white
to
his
lips
and
glancing
about
him
like
rat
in
trap
“Oh
it
won’t
do
really
it
won’t
said
holmes
suavely
“There
is
no
possible
getting
out
of
it
mr
windibank
it
is
quite
too
transparent
and
it
was
very
bad
compliment
when
you
said
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
solve
so
simple
question
that’s
right
sit
down
and
let
us
talk
it
over
our
visitor
collapsed
into
chair
with
ghastly
face
and
glitter
of
moisture
on
his
brow
“It
it’s
not
actionable
he
stammered
“I
am
very
much
afraid
that
it
is
not
but
between
ourselves
windibank
it
was
as
cruel
and
selfish
and
heartless
trick
in
petty
way
as
ever
came
before
me
now
let
me
just
run
over
the
course
of
events
and
you
will
contradict
me
if
go
wrong
the
man
sat
huddled
up
in
his
chair
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
breast
like
one
who
is
utterly
crushed
holmes
stuck
his
feet
up
on
the
corner
of
the
mantelpiece
and
leaning
back
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
began
talking
rather
to
himself
as
it
seemed
than
to
us
“The
man
married
woman
very
much
older
than
himself
for
her
money
said
he
“and
he
enjoyed
the
use
of
the
money
of
the
daughter
as
long
as
she
lived
with
them
it
was
considerable
sum
for
people
in
their
position
and
the
loss
of
it
would
have
made
serious
difference
it
was
worth
an
effort
to
preserve
it
the
daughter
was
of
good
amiable
disposition
but
affectionate
and
warm
hearted
in
her
ways
so
that
it
was
evident
that
with
her
fair
personal
advantages
and
her
little
income
she
would
not
be
allowed
to
remain
single
long
now
her
marriage
would
mean
of
course
the
loss
of
hundred
year
so
what
does
her
stepfather
do
to
prevent
it
he
takes
the
obvious
course
of
keeping
her
at
home
and
forbidding
her
to
seek
the
company
of
people
of
her
own
age
but
soon
he
found
that
would
not
answer
forever
she
became
restive
insisted
upon
her
rights
and
finally
announced
her
positive
intention
of
going
to
certain
ball
what
does
her
clever
stepfather
do
then
he
conceives
an
idea
more
creditable
to
his
head
than
to
his
heart
with
the
connivance
and
assistance
of
his
wife
he
disguised
himself
covered
those
keen
eyes
with
tinted
glasses
masked
the
face
with
moustache
and
pair
of
bushy
whiskers
sunk
that
clear
voice
into
an
insinuating
whisper
and
doubly
secure
on
account
of
the
girl’s
short
sight
he
appears
as
mr
hosmer
angel
and
keeps
off
other
lovers
by
making
love
himself
“It
was
only
joke
at
first
groaned
our
visitor
“We
never
thought
that
she
would
have
been
so
carried
away
“Very
likely
not
however
that
may
be
the
young
lady
was
very
decidedly
carried
away
and
having
quite
made
up
her
mind
that
her
stepfather
was
in
france
the
suspicion
of
treachery
never
for
an
instant
entered
her
mind
she
was
flattered
by
the
gentleman’s
attentions
and
the
effect
was
increased
by
the
loudly
expressed
admiration
of
her
mother
then
mr
angel
began
to
call
for
it
was
obvious
that
the
matter
should
be
pushed
as
far
as
it
would
go
if
real
effect
were
to
be
produced
there
were
meetings
and
an
engagement
which
would
finally
secure
the
girl’s
affections
from
turning
towards
anyone
else
but
the
deception
could
not
be
kept
up
forever
these
pretended
journeys
to
france
were
rather
cumbrous
the
thing
to
do
was
clearly
to
bring
the
business
to
an
end
in
such
dramatic
manner
that
it
would
leave
permanent
impression
upon
the
young
lady’s
mind
and
prevent
her
from
looking
upon
any
other
suitor
for
some
time
to
come
hence
those
vows
of
fidelity
exacted
upon
testament
and
hence
also
the
allusions
to
possibility
of
something
happening
on
the
very
morning
of
the
wedding
james
windibank
wished
miss
sutherland
to
be
so
bound
to
hosmer
angel
and
so
uncertain
as
to
his
fate
that
for
ten
years
to
come
at
any
rate
she
would
not
listen
to
another
man
as
far
as
the
church
door
he
brought
her
and
then
as
he
could
go
no
farther
he
conveniently
vanished
away
by
the
old
trick
of
stepping
in
at
one
door
of
four
wheeler
and
out
at
the
other
think
that
was
the
chain
of
events
mr
windibank
our
visitor
had
recovered
something
of
his
assurance
while
holmes
had
been
talking
and
he
rose
from
his
chair
now
with
cold
sneer
upon
his
pale
face
“It
may
be
so
or
it
may
not
mr
holmes
said
he
“but
if
you
are
so
very
sharp
you
ought
to
be
sharp
enough
to
know
that
it
is
you
who
are
breaking
the
law
now
and
not
me
have
done
nothing
actionable
from
the
first
but
as
long
as
you
keep
that
door
locked
you
lay
yourself
open
to
an
action
for
assault
and
illegal
constraint
“The
law
cannot
as
you
say
touch
you
said
holmes
unlocking
and
throwing
open
the
door
“yet
there
never
was
man
who
deserved
punishment
more
if
the
young
lady
has
brother
or
friend
he
ought
to
lay
whip
across
your
shoulders
by
jove
he
continued
flushing
up
at
the
sight
of
the
bitter
sneer
upon
the
man’s
face
“it
is
not
part
of
my
duties
to
my
client
but
here’s
hunting
crop
handy
and
think
shall
just
treat
myself
to—”
he
took
two
swift
steps
to
the
whip
but
before
he
could
grasp
it
there
was
wild
clatter
of
steps
upon
the
stairs
the
heavy
hall
door
banged
and
from
the
window
we
could
see
mr
james
windibank
running
at
the
top
of
his
speed
down
the
road
“There’s
cold
blooded
scoundrel
said
holmes
laughing
as
he
threw
himself
down
into
his
chair
once
more
“That
fellow
will
rise
from
crime
to
crime
until
he
does
something
very
bad
and
ends
on
gallows
the
case
has
in
some
respects
been
not
entirely
devoid
of
interest
“I
cannot
now
entirely
see
all
the
steps
of
your
reasoning
remarked
“Well
of
course
it
was
obvious
from
the
first
that
this
mr
hosmer
angel
must
have
some
strong
object
for
his
curious
conduct
and
it
was
equally
clear
that
the
only
man
who
really
profited
by
the
incident
as
far
as
we
could
see
was
the
stepfather
then
the
fact
that
the
two
men
were
never
together
but
that
the
one
always
appeared
when
the
other
was
away
was
suggestive
so
were
the
tinted
spectacles
and
the
curious
voice
which
both
hinted
at
disguise
as
did
the
bushy
whiskers
my
suspicions
were
all
confirmed
by
his
peculiar
action
in
typewriting
his
signature
which
of
course
inferred
that
his
handwriting
was
so
familiar
to
her
that
she
would
recognise
even
the
smallest
sample
of
it
you
see
all
these
isolated
facts
together
with
many
minor
ones
all
pointed
in
the
same
direction
“And
how
did
you
verify
them
“Having
once
spotted
my
man
it
was
easy
to
get
corroboration
knew
the
firm
for
which
this
man
worked
having
taken
the
printed
description
eliminated
everything
from
it
which
could
be
the
result
of
disguise
the
whiskers
the
glasses
the
voice
and
sent
it
to
the
firm
with
request
that
they
would
inform
me
whether
it
answered
to
the
description
of
any
of
their
travellers
had
already
noticed
the
peculiarities
of
the
typewriter
and
wrote
to
the
man
himself
at
his
business
address
asking
him
if
he
would
come
here
as
expected
his
reply
was
typewritten
and
revealed
the
same
trivial
but
characteristic
defects
the
same

me
letter
from

in

my
experience
of
camp
life
in
afghanistan
had
at
least
had
the
effect
of
making
me
prompt
and
ready
traveller
my
wants
were
few
and
simple

that
in
less
than
the

stated

in

with

sherlock

pacing
up

down

his
tall
gaunt
figure
made
even
gaunter
and
taller
by
his
long
grey
travelling
cloak
and
close
fitting

“It

we
had
the
carriage
to
ourselves

for
an
immense
litter
of

which
holmes
had
brought
with
him
among
these
he
rummaged
and
read
with
intervals
of
note
taking
and
of
meditation
until
we
were
past
reading
then
he
suddenly
rolled
them
all
into
gigantic
ball
and
tossed
them
up
onto
the
rack
“Have
you
heard
anything
of
the
case
he
asked
“Not

it
seems
from
what
gather
to
be
one
of
those
simple
cases
which
are
so
extremely
difficult
“That
sounds
little
paradoxical
“But

is
the
more

it
is
to

in
this

however
they
have
established
very
serious
case
against
the

of
the
murdered

“It
is
murder

“Well
it
is
conjectured
to
be
so
shall
take
nothing
for

until
have
the
opportunity
of
looking
personally
into
it
will
explain
the
state
of
things
to
you
as
far
as
have
been
able
to
understand
it
in
very
few
words
“Boscombe
valley
is
country
district
not
very
far
from
ross
in
herefordshire
the
largest
landed
proprietor
in
that
part
is
mr
john
turner
who
made
his
money
in
australia
and
returned
some
years
ago
to
the
old
country
one
of
the
farms
which
he
held
that
of
hatherley
was
let
to
mr
charles
mcCarthy
who
was
also
an
ex
australian
the
men
had
known
each
other
in
the
colonies
so
that
it
was
not
unnatural
that
when
they
came
to
settle
down
they
should
do
so
as
near
each
other
as
possible
turner
was
apparently
the
richer
man
so
mcCarthy
became
his
tenant
but
still
remained
it
seems
upon
terms
of
perfect
equality
as
they
were
frequently
together
mcCarthy
had
one
son
lad
of
eighteen
and
turner
had
an
only
daughter
of
the
same
age
but
neither
of
them
had
wives
living
they
appear
to
have
avoided
the
society
of
the
neighbouring
english
families
and
to
have
led
retired
lives
though
both
the
mcCarthys
were
fond
of
sport
and
were
frequently
seen
at
the
race
meetings
of
the
neighbourhood
mcCarthy
kept
two
servants
man
and
girl
turner
had
considerable
household
some
half
dozen
at
the
least
that
is
as
much
as
have
been
able
to
gather
about
the
families
now
for
the
facts
“On
june
3rd
that
is
on
monday
last
mcCarthy
left
his
house
at
hatherley
about
three
in
the
afternoon
and
walked
down
to
the
boscombe
pool
which
is
small
lake
formed
by
the
spreading
out
of
the
stream
which
runs
down
the
boscombe
valley
he
had
been
out
with
his
serving
man
in
the
morning
at
ross
and
he
had
told
the
man
that
he
must
hurry
as
he
had
an
appointment
of
importance
to
keep
at
three
from
that
appointment
he
never
came
back
alive
“From
hatherley
farmhouse
to
the
boscombe
pool
is
quarter
of
mile
and
two
people
saw
him
as
he
passed
over
this
ground
one
was
an
old
woman
whose
name
is
not
mentioned
and
the
other
was
william
crowder
game
keeper
in
the
employ
of
mr
turner
both
these
witnesses
depose
that
mr
mcCarthy
was
walking
alone
the
game
keeper
adds
that
within
few
minutes
of
his
seeing
mr
mcCarthy
pass
he
had
seen
his
son
mr
james
mcCarthy
going
the
same
way
with
gun
under
his
arm
to
the
best
of
his
belief
the
father
was
actually
in
sight
at
the
time
and
the
son
was
following
him
he
thought
no
more
of
the
matter
until
he
heard
in
the
evening
of
the
tragedy
that
had
occurred
“The
two
mcCarthys
were
seen
after
the
time
when
william
crowder
the
game
keeper
lost
sight
of
them
the
boscombe
pool
is
thickly
wooded
round
with
just
fringe
of
grass
and
of
reeds
round
the
edge
girl
of
fourteen
patience
moran
who
is
the
daughter
of
the
lodge
keeper
of
the
boscombe
valley
estate
was
in
one
of
the
woods
picking
flowers
she
states
that
while
she
was
there
she
saw
at
the
border
of
the
wood
and
close
by
the
lake
mr
mcCarthy
and
his
son
and
that
they
appeared
to
be
having
violent
quarrel
she
heard
mr
mcCarthy
the
elder
using
very
strong
language
to
his
son
and
she
saw
the
latter
raise
up
his
hand
as
if
to
strike
his
father
she
was
so
frightened
by
their
violence
that
she
ran
away
and
told
her
mother
when
she
reached
home
that
she
had
left
the
two
mcCarthys
quarrelling
near
boscombe
pool
and
that
she
was
afraid
that
they
were
going
to
fight
she
had
hardly
said
the
words
when
young
mr
mcCarthy
came
running
up
to
the
lodge
to
say
that
he
had
found
his
father
dead
in
the
wood
and
to
ask
for
the
help
of
the
lodge
keeper
he
was
much
excited
without
either
his
gun
or
his
hat
and
his
right
hand
and
sleeve
were
observed
to
be
stained
with
fresh
blood
on
following
him
they
found
the
dead
body
stretched
out
upon
the
grass
beside
the
pool
the
head
had
been
beaten
in
by
repeated
blows
of
some
heavy
and
blunt
weapon
the
injuries
were
such
as
might
very
well
have
been
inflicted
by
the
butt
end
of
his
son’s
gun
which
was
found
lying
on
the
grass
within
few
paces
of
the
body
under
these
circumstances
the
young
man
was
instantly
arrested
and
verdict
of
‘wilful
murder’
having
been
returned
at
the
inquest
on
tuesday
he
was
on
wednesday
brought
before
the
magistrates
at
ross
who
have
referred
the
case
to
the
next
assizes
those
are
the
main
facts
of
the
case
as
they
came
out
before
the
coroner
and
the
police
court
“I
could
hardly
imagine
more
damning
case
remarked
“If
ever
circumstantial
evidence
pointed
to
criminal
it
does
so
here
“Circumstantial
evidence
is
very
tricky
thing
answered
holmes
thoughtfully
“It
may
seem
to
point
very
straight
to
one
thing
but
if
you
shift
your
own
point
of
view
little
you
may
find
it
pointing
in
an
equally
uncompromising
manner
to
something
entirely
different
it
must
be
confessed
however
that
the
case
looks
exceedingly
grave
against
the
young
man
and
it
is
very
possible
that
he
is
indeed
the
culprit
there
are
several
people
in
the
neighbourhood
however
and
among
them
miss
turner
the
daughter
of
the
neighbouring
landowner
who
believe
in
his
innocence
and
who
have
retained
lestrade
whom
you
may
recollect
in
connection
with
the
study
in
scarlet
to
work
out
the
case
in
his
interest
lestrade
being
rather
puzzled
has
referred
the
case
to
me
and
hence
it
is
that
two
middle
aged
gentlemen
are
flying
westward
at
fifty
miles
an
hour
instead
of
quietly
digesting
their
breakfasts
at
home
“I
am
afraid
said
“that
the
facts
are
so
obvious
that
you
will
find
little
credit
to
be
gained
out
of
this
case
“There
is
nothing
more
deceptive
than
an
obvious
fact
he
answered
laughing
“Besides
we
may
chance
to
hit
upon
some
other
obvious
facts
which
may
have
been
by
no
means
obvious
to
mr
lestrade
you
know
me
too
well
to
think
that
am
boasting
when
say
that
shall
either
confirm
or
destroy
his
theory
by
means
which
he
is
quite
incapable
of
employing
or
even
of
understanding
to
take
the
first
example
to
hand
very
clearly
perceive
that
in
your
bedroom
the
window
is
upon
the
right
hand
side
and
yet
question
whether
mr
lestrade
would
have
noted
even
so
self
evident
thing
as
that
“How
on
earth—”
“My
dear
fellow
know
you
well
know
the
military
neatness
which
characterises
you
shave
every
morning
and
in
this
season
you
shave
by
the
sunlight
but
since
your
shaving
is
less
and
less
complete
as
we
get
farther
back
on
the
left
side
until
it
becomes
positively
slovenly
as
we
get
round
the
angle
of
the
jaw
it
is
surely
very
clear
that
side
is
less
illuminated
than
the
other
could
not
imagine
man
of
your
habits
looking
at
himself
in
an
equal
light
and
being
satisfied
with
such
result
only
quote
this
as
trivial
example
of
observation
and
inference
therein
lies
my
métier
and
it
is
just
possible
that
it
may
be
of
some
service
in
the
investigation
which
lies
before
us
there
are
one
or
two
minor
points
which
were
brought
out
in
the
inquest
and
which
are
worth
considering
“What
are
they
“It
appears
that
his
arrest
did
not
take
place
at
once
but
after
the
return
to
hatherley
farm
on
the
inspector
of
constabulary
informing
him
that
he
was
prisoner
he
remarked
that
he
was
not
surprised
to
hear
it
and
that
it
was
no
more
than
his
deserts
this
observation
of
his
had
the
natural
effect
of
removing
any
traces
of
doubt
which
might
have
remained
in
the
minds
of
the
coroner’s
jury

“It
was
confession
ejaculated
“No
for
it
was
followed
by
protestation
of
innocence
“Coming
on
the
top
of
such
damning
series
of
events
it
was
at
least
most
suspicious

the
contrary

holmes
“it
is
the
brightest
rift

can
at
present
see
in
the
clouds

innocent
he
might
be
he
could
not
be
such
an
absolute
imbecile
as
not
to
see
that
the
circumstances
were
very
black
against
him
had
he
appeared
surprised
at
his
own
arrest
or
feigned
indignation
at
it
should
have
looked
upon
it
as
highly
suspicious
because
such
surprise
or
anger
would
not
be
natural
under
the
circumstances
and
yet
might
appear
to
be
the
best
policy
to
scheming
man
his
frank
acceptance
of
the
situation
marks
him
as
either
an
innocent
man

else
as
man
of
considerable
self
restraint
and
firmness
as
to
his
remark
about
his
deserts
it
was
also
not
unnatural
if
you
consider
that
he
stood
beside
the
dead
body
of
his
father
and
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
had
that
very
day
so
far
forgotten
his
filial
duty
as
to
bandy
words
with
him
and
even
according
to
the
little
girl
whose
evidence
is
so
important
to
raise
his
hand
as
if
to
strike
him
the
self
reproach
and
contrition
which
are
displayed
in
his
remark
appear
to
me
to
be
the
signs
of
healthy
mind

than
of
guilty

my
head
“Many
men

slighter
evidence

“So
they
have

hanged

young
man’s
own
account
of
the
matter

encouraging

are

are

here

he
picked
out
from
his
bundle
copy
of
the
local
herefordshire
paper
and
having
turned
down
the
sheet
he
pointed
out
the
paragraph
in
which
the
unfortunate
young
man
had
given
his
own
statement
of
what
had
occurred
settled
myself
down
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
and
read
it
very
carefully
it
ran
in
this
way
“Mr
james
mcCarthy
the
only
son
of
the
deceased
was
then
called
and
gave
evidence
as
follows
‘I
had
been
away
from
home
for
three
days
at
bristol
and
had
only
just
returned
upon
the
morning
of
last
monday
the
3rd
my
father
was
absent
from
home
at
the
time
of
my
arrival
and
was
informed
by
the
maid
that
he
had
driven
over
to
ross
with
john
cobb
the
groom
shortly
after
my
return
heard
the
wheels
of
his
trap
in
the
yard
and
looking
out
of
my
window
saw
him
get
out
and
walk
rapidly
out
of
the
yard
though
was
not
aware
in
which
direction
he
was
going
then
took
my
gun
and
strolled
out
in
the
direction
of
the
boscombe
pool
with
the
intention
of
visiting
the
rabbit
warren
which
is
upon
the
other
side
on
my
way

william
crowder
the
game
keeper
as
he
had
stated
in
his
evidence
but
he
is
mistaken
in
thinking
that
was
following
my
father
had
no
idea
that
he
was
in
front
of
me
when
about
hundred
yards
from
the
pool
heard
cry
of
“Cooee
which
was
usual
signal
between
my
father
and
myself
then
hurried
forward
and
found
him
standing
by
the
pool
he
appeared
to
be
much
surprised
at
seeing
me
and
asked
me
rather
roughly
what
was
doing
there
conversation
ensued
which
led
to
high
words
and
almost
to
blows
for
my
father
was
man
of
very
violent
temper
seeing
that
his
passion
was
becoming
ungovernable
left
him
and
returned
towards
hatherley
farm
had
not
gone
more
than
150
yards
however
when
heard
hideous
outcry
behind
me
which
caused
me
to
run
back
again
found
my
father
expiring
upon
the
ground
with
his
head
terribly
injured
dropped
my
gun
and
held
him
in
my
arms
but
he
almost
instantly
expired
knelt
beside
him
for
some
minutes
and
then
made
my
way
to
mr
turner’s
lodge
keeper
his
house
being
the
nearest
to
ask
for
assistance
saw
no
one
near
my
father
when
returned
and
have
no
idea
how
he
came
by
his
injuries
he
was
not
popular
man
being
somewhat
cold
and
forbidding
in
his
manners
but
he
had
as
far
as
know
no
active
enemies
know
nothing
further
of
the
matter
“The
coroner
did
your
father
make
any
statement
to
you
before
he
died
“Witness
he
mumbled
few
words
but
could
only
catch
some
allusion
to
rat
“The
coroner
what
did
you
understand
by
that
“Witness
it
conveyed
no
meaning
to
me
thought
that
he
was
delirious
“The
coroner
what
was
the
point
upon
which
you
and
your
father
had
this
final
quarrel
“Witness
should
prefer
not
to
answer
“The
coroner
am
afraid
that
must
press
it
“Witness
it
is
really
impossible
for
me
to
tell
you
can
assure
you
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
sad
tragedy
which
followed
“The
coroner
that
is
for
the
court
to
decide
need
not
point
out
to
you
that
your
refusal
to
answer
will
prejudice
your
case
considerably
in
any
future
proceedings
which
may
arise
“Witness
must
still
refuse
“The
coroner
understand
that
the
cry
of
‘Cooee’
was
common
signal
between
you
and
your
father
“Witness
it
was
“The
coroner
how
was
it
then
that
he
uttered
it
before
he
saw
you
and
before
he
even
knew
that
you
had
returned
from
bristol
“Witness
with
considerable
confusion
do
not
know
“A
juryman
did
you
see
nothing
which
aroused
your
suspicions
when
you
returned
on
hearing
the
cry
and
found
your
father
fatally
injured
“Witness
nothing
definite
“The
coroner
what
do
you
mean
“Witness
was
so
disturbed
and
excited
as
rushed
out
into
the
open
that
could
think
of
nothing
except
of
my
father
yet
have
vague
impression
that
as
ran
forward
something
lay
upon
the
ground
to
the
left
of
me
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
something
grey
in
colour
coat
of
some
sort
or
plaid
perhaps
when
rose
from
my
father
looked
round
for
it
but
it
was
gone
‘Do
you
mean
that
it
disappeared
before
you
went
for
help
‘Yes
it
was
gone
“‘You
cannot
say
what
it
was
‘No
had
feeling
something
was
there
‘How
far
from
the
body
‘A
dozen
yards
or
so
‘And
how
far
from
the
edge
of
the
wood
‘About
the
same
‘Then
if
it
was
removed
it
was
while
you
were
within
dozen
yards
of
it
‘Yes
but
with
my
back
towards
it
“This
concluded
the
examination
of
the
witness
“I
see
said
as
glanced
down
the
column
“that
the
coroner
in
his
concluding
remarks
was
rather
severe
upon
young
mcCarthy
he
calls
attention
and
with
reason
to
the
discrepancy
about
his
father
having
signalled
to
him
before
seeing
him
also
to
his
refusal
to
give
details
of
his
conversation
with
his
father
and
his
singular
account
of
his
father’s
dying
words
they
are
all
as
he
remarks
very
much
against
the
son
holmes
laughed
softly
to
himself
and
stretched
himself
out
upon
the
cushioned
seat
“Both
you
and
the
coroner
have
been
at
some
pains
said
he
“to
single
out
the
very
strongest
points
in
the
young
man’s
favour
don’t
you
see
that
you
alternately
give
him
credit
for
having
too
much
imagination
and
too
little
too
little
if
he
could
not
invent
cause
of
quarrel
which
would
give
him
the
sympathy
of
the
jury
too
much
if
he
evolved
from
his
own
inner
consciousness
anything
so
outré
as
dying
reference
to
rat
and
the
incident
of
the
vanishing
cloth
no
sir
shall
approach
this
case
from
the
point
of
view
that
what
this
young
man
says
is
true
and
we
shall
see
whither
that
hypothesis
will
lead
us
and
now
here
is
my
pocket
petrarch
and
not
another
word
shall
say
of
this
case

we
are
on
the
scene
of
action
we
lunch
at
swindon
and
see
that
we
shall
be
there
in
twenty
minutes
it
was
nearly
four
o’clock
when
we
at
last
after
passing
through
the
beautiful
stroud
valley
and
over
the
broad
gleaming
severn
found
ourselves
at
the
pretty
little
country
town
of
ross
lean
ferret
like
man
furtive
and
sly
looking
was
waiting
for
us
upon
the
platform
in
spite
of
the
light
brown
dustcoat
and
leather
leggings
which
he
wore
in
deference
to
his
rustic
surroundings
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
lestrade
of
scotland
yard
with
him
we
drove
to
the
hereford
arms
where
room
had
already
been
engaged
for
us
“I
have
ordered
carriage
said
lestrade
as
we
sat
over
cup
of
tea
“I
knew
your
energetic
nature
and
that
you
would
not
be
happy
until
you
had
been
on
the
scene
of
the
crime
“It
was
very
nice
and
complimentary
of
you
holmes
answered
“It
is
entirely
question
of
barometric
pressure
lestrade
looked
startled
“I
do
not
quite
follow

said
“How

lestrade
laughed
indulgently
“You
have
no
doubt
already
formed
your
conclusions
from
the
newspapers
he
said
“The
case
is
as
plain
as
pikestaff
and
the
more
one
goes
into
it
the
plainer
it
becomes
still
of
course
one
can’t
refuse
lady
and
such
very
positive
one
too
she
has
heard
of
you
and
would
have
your
opinion
though
repeatedly
told
her
that
there
was
nothing
which
you
could
do
which
had
not
already
done

bless

soul
here
is
her
carriage
at
the
door
he
had
hardly
spoken
before
there
rushed
into
the
room
one
of
the
most
lovely
young
women
that
have
ever
seen
in
my
life
her
violet
eyes
shining
her
lips
parted
pink
flush
upon
her
cheeks
all
thought
of
her
natural
reserve
lost
in
her
overpowering
excitement
and
concern
“Oh
mr
sherlock
holmes
she
cried
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
and
finally
with
woman’s
quick
intuition
fastening
upon
my
companion
“I
am
so
glad
that
you
have
come
have
driven
down
to
tell
you
so
know
that
james
didn’t
do
it
know
it
and
want
you
to
start
upon
your
work
knowing
it
too
never
let
yourself
doubt
upon
that
point
we
have
known
each
other
since
we
were
little
children
and
know
his
faults
as
no
one
else
does
but
he
is
too
tender
hearted
to
hurt
fly
such
charge
is
absurd
to
anyone
who
really
knows
him
“I
hope
we
may
clear
him
miss
turner
said
sherlock
holmes
“You
may
rely
upon
my
doing
all
that
can
“But
you
have
read
the
evidence
you
have
formed
some
conclusion
do
you
not
see
some
loophole
some
flaw
do
you
not
yourself
think
that
he
is
innocent
“I
think
that
it
is
very
probable
“There
now
she
cried
throwing
back
her
head
and
looking
defiantly
at
lestrade
“You
hear
he
gives
me
hopes
lestrade
shrugged
his
shoulders
“I
am
afraid
that
my
colleague
has
been
little
quick
in
forming
his
conclusions
he
said
“But
he
is
right
oh
know
that
he
is
right
james
never
did
it
and
about
his
quarrel
with
his
father
am
sure
that
the
reason
why
he
would
not
speak
about
it
to
the
coroner
was
because
was
concerned
in
it
“In
what
way
asked
holmes
“It
is
no
time
for
me
to
hide
anything
james
and
his
father
had
many
disagreements
about
me
mr
mcCarthy
was
very
anxious
that
there
should
be
marriage
between
us
james
and
have
always
loved
each
other
as
brother
and
sister
but
of
course
he
is
young
and
has
seen
very
little
of
life
yet
and
well
he
naturally
did
not
wish
to
do
anything
like
that
yet
so
there
were
quarrels
and
this
am
sure
was
one
of
them
“And
your
father
asked
holmes
“Was
he
in
favour
of
such
union
“No
he
was
averse
to
it
also
no
one
but
mr
mcCarthy
was
in
favour
of
it
quick
blush
passed
over
her
fresh
young
face
as
holmes
shot
one
of
his
keen
questioning
glances
at
her
“Thank
you
for
this
information
said
he
“May
see
your
father
if
call
to
morrow
“I
am
afraid
the
doctor
won’t
allow
it
“The
doctor
“Yes
have
you
not
heard
poor
father
has
never
been
strong
for
years
back
but
this
has
broken
him
down
completely
he
has
taken
to
his
bed
and
dr
willows
says
that
he
is
wreck
and
that
his
nervous
system
is
shattered
mr
mcCarthy
was
the
only
man
alive
who
had
known
dad
in
the
old
days
in
victoria
“Ha
in
victoria
that
is
important
“Yes
at
the
mines
“Quite
so
at
the
gold
mines
where
as
understand
mr
turner
made
his
money
“Yes
certainly
“Thank
you
miss
turner
you
have
been
of
material
assistance
to
me
“You
will
tell
me
if
you
have
any
news
to
morrow
no
doubt
you
will
go
to
the
prison
to
see
james
oh
if
you
do
mr
holmes
do
tell
him
that
know
him
to
be
innocent
“I
will
miss
turner
“I
must
go
home
now
for
dad
is
very
ill
and
he
misses
me
so
if
leave
him
good
bye
and
god
help
you
in
your
undertaking
she
hurried
from
the
room
as
impulsively
as
she
had
entered
and
we
heard
the
wheels
of
her
carriage
rattle
off
down
the
street
“I
am
ashamed
of
you
holmes
said
lestrade
with
dignity
after
few
minutes’
silence
“Why
should
you
raise
up
hopes
which
you
are
bound
to
disappoint
am
not
over
tender
of
heart
but
call
it
cruel
“I
think
that
see
my
way
to
clearing
james
mcCarthy
said
holmes
“Have
you
an
order
to
see
him
in
prison
“Yes
but
only
for
you
and
me
“Then
shall
reconsider
my
resolution
about
going
out
we
have
still
time
to
take
train
to
hereford
and
see
him
to
night
“Ample
“Then
let
us
do
so
watson
fear
that
you
will
find
it
very
slow
but
shall
only
be
away
couple
of
hours
walked
down
to
the
station
with
them
and
then
wandered
through
the
streets
of
the
little
town
finally
returning
to
the
hotel
where
lay
upon
the
sofa
and
tried
to
interest
myself
in
yellow
backed
novel
the
puny
plot
of
the
story
was
so
thin
however
when
compared
to
the
deep
mystery
through
which
we
were
groping
and
found
my
attention
wander
so
continually
from
the
action
to
the
fact
that
at
last
flung
it
across
the
room
and
gave
myself
up
entirely
to
consideration
of
the
events
of
the
day
supposing
that
this
unhappy
young
man’s
story
were
absolutely
true
then
what
hellish
thing
what
absolutely
unforeseen
and
extraordinary
calamity
could
have
occurred
between
the
time
when
he
parted
from
his
father
and
the
moment
when
drawn
back
by
his
screams
he
rushed
into
the
glade
it
was
something
terrible
and
deadly
what
could
it
be
might
not
the
nature
of
the
injuries
reveal
something
to
my
medical
instincts
rang
the
bell
and
called
for
the
weekly
county
paper
which
contained
verbatim
account
of
the
inquest
in
the
surgeon’s
deposition
it
was
stated
that
the
posterior
third
of
the
left
parietal
bone
and
the
left
half
of
the
occipital
bone
had
been
shattered
by
heavy
blow
from
blunt
weapon
marked
the
spot
upon
my
own
head
clearly
such
blow
must
have
been
struck
from
behind
that
was
to
some
extent
in
favour
of
the
accused
as
when
seen
quarrelling
he
was
face
to
face
with
his
father
still
it
did
not
go
for
very
much
for
the
older
man
might
have
turned
his
back
before
the
blow
fell
still
it
might
be
worth
while
to
call
holmes’
attention
to
it
then
there
was
the
peculiar
dying
reference
to
rat
what
could
that
mean
it
could
not
be
delirium
man
dying
from
sudden
blow
does
not
commonly
become
delirious
no
it
was
more
likely
to
be
an
attempt
to
explain
how
he
met
his
fate
but
what
could
it
indicate
cudgelled
my
brains
to
find
some
possible
explanation
and
then
the
incident
of
the
grey
cloth
seen
by
young
mcCarthy
if
that
were
true
the
murderer
must
have
dropped
some
part
of
his
dress
presumably
his
overcoat
in
his
flight
and
must
have
had
the
hardihood
to
return
and
to
carry
it
away
at
the
instant
when
the
son
was
kneeling
with
his
back
turned
not
dozen
paces
off
what
tissue
of
mysteries
and
improbabilities
the
whole
thing
was
did
not
wonder
at
lestrade’s
opinion
and
yet
had
so
much
faith
in
sherlock
holmes’
insight
that
could
not
lose
hope
as
long
as
every
fresh
fact
seemed
to
strengthen
his
conviction
of
young
mcCarthy’s
innocence
it
was
late
before
sherlock
holmes
returned
he
came
back
alone
for
lestrade
was
staying
in
lodgings
in
the
town
“The
glass
still
keeps
very
high
he
remarked
as
he
sat
down
“It
is
of
importance
that
it
should
not
rain
before
we
are
able
to
go
over
the
ground
on
the
other
hand
man
should
be
at
his
very
best
and
keenest
for
such
nice
work
as
that
and
did
not
wish
to
do
it
when
fagged
by
long
journey
have
seen
young
mcCarthy
“And
what
did
you
learn
from
him
“Nothing
“Could
he
throw
no
light
“None
at
all
was
inclined
to
think
at
one
time
that
he
knew
who
had
done
it
and
was
screening
him
or
her
but
am
convinced
now
that
he
is
as
puzzled
as
everyone
else
he
is
not
very
quick
witted
youth
though
comely
to
look
at
and
should
think
sound
at
heart
“I
cannot
admire
his
taste
remarked
“if
it
is
indeed
fact
that
he
was
averse
to
marriage
with
so
charming
young
lady
as
this
miss
turner
“Ah
thereby
hangs
rather
painful
tale
this
fellow
is
madly
insanely
in
love
with
her
but
some
two
years
ago
when
he
was
only
lad
and
before
he
really
knew
her
for
she
had
been
away
five
years
at
boarding
school
what
does
the
idiot
do
but
get
into
the
clutches
of
barmaid
in
bristol
and
marry
her
at
registry
office
no
one
knows
word
of
the
matter
but
you
can
imagine
how
maddening
it
must
be
to
him
to
be
upbraided
for
not
doing
what
he
would
give
his
very
eyes
to
do
but
what
he
knows
to
be
absolutely
impossible
it
was
sheer
frenzy
of
this
sort
which
made
him
throw
his
hands
up
into
the
air
when
his
father
at
their
last
interview
was
goading
him
on
to
propose
to
miss
turner
on
the
other
hand
he
had
no
means
of
supporting
himself
and
his
father
who
was
by
all
accounts
very
hard
man
would
have
thrown
him
over
utterly
had
he
known
the
truth
it
was
with
his
barmaid
wife
that
he
had
spent
the
last
three
days
in
bristol
and
his
father
did
not
know
where
he
was
mark
that
point
it
is
of
importance
good
has
come
out
of
evil
however
for
the
barmaid
finding
from
the
papers
that
he
is
in
serious
trouble
and
likely
to
be
hanged
has
thrown
him
over
utterly
and
has
written
to
him
to
say
that
she
has
husband
already
in
the
bermuda
dockyard
so
that
there
is
really
no
tie
between
them
think
that
bit
of
news
has
consoled
young
mcCarthy
for
all
that
he
has
suffered

“But
if
he
is
innocent
who
has
done
it
“Ah
who
would
call
your
attention
very
particularly
to
two
points
one
is
that
the
murdered
man
had
an
appointment
with
someone
at
the
pool
and
that
the
someone
could
not
have
been
his
son
for
his
son
was
away
and
he
did
not
know
when
he
would
return
the
second
is
that
the
murdered
man
was
heard
to
cry
‘Cooee
before
he
knew
that
his
son
had
returned
those
are
the
crucial
points
upon
which
the
case
depends
and
now
let
us
talk
about
george
meredith
if
you
please
and
we
shall
leave
all
minor
matters
until
to
morrow
there
was
no
rain
as
holmes
had
foretold
and
the
morning
broke
bright
and
cloudless
at
nine
o’clock
lestrade
called
for
us
with
the
carriage
and
we
set
off
for
hatherley
farm
and
the
boscombe
pool
“There
is
serious
news
this
morning
lestrade
observed
“It
is
said
that
mr
turner
of
the
hall
is
so
ill
that
his
life
is
despaired
of
“An
elderly
man
presume
said
holmes
“About
sixty
but
his
constitution
has
been
shattered
by
his
life
abroad
and
he
has
been
in
failing
health
for
some
time
this
business
has
had
very
bad
effect
upon
him
he
was
an
old
friend
of
mcCarthy’s
and
may
add
great
benefactor
to
him
for
have
learned
that
he
gave
him
hatherley
farm
rent
free
“Indeed
that
is
interesting
said
holmes
“Oh
yes
in
hundred
other
ways
he
has
helped
him
everybody
about
here
speaks
of
his
kindness
to
him
“Really
does
it
not
strike
you
as
little
singular
that
this
mcCarthy
who
appears
to
have
had
little
of
his
own
and
to
have
been
under
such
obligations
to
turner
should
still
talk
of
marrying
his
son
to
turner’s
daughter
who
is
presumably
heiress
to
the
estate
and
that
in
such
very
cocksure
manner
as
if
it
were
merely
case
of
proposal
and
all
else
would
follow
it
is
the
more
strange
since
we
know
that
turner
himself
was
averse
to
the
idea
the
daughter
told
us
as
much
do
you
not
deduce
something
from
that
“We
have
got
to
the
deductions
and
the
inferences
said
lestrade
winking
at
me
“I
find
it
hard
enough
to
tackle
facts
holmes
without
flying
away
after
theories
and
fancies
“You
are
right
said
holmes
demurely
“you
do
find
it
very
hard
to
tackle
the
facts
“Anyhow
have
grasped
one
fact
which
you
seem
to
find
it
difficult
to
get
hold
of
replied
lestrade
with
some
warmth
“And
that
is—”
“That
mcCarthy
senior
met
his
death
from
mcCarthy
junior
and
that
all
theories
to
the
contrary
are
the
merest
moonshine
“Well
moonshine
is
brighter
thing
than
fog
said
holmes
laughing
“But
am
very
much
mistaken
if
this
is
not
hatherley
farm
upon
the
left
“Yes
that
is
it
was
widespread
comfortable
looking
building
two
storied
slate
roofed
with
great
yellow
blotches
of
lichen
upon
the
grey
walls
the
drawn
blinds
and
the
smokeless
chimneys
however
gave
it
stricken
look
as
though
the
weight
of
this
horror
still
lay
heavy
upon
it
we
called
at
the
door
when
the
maid
at
holmes’
request
showed
us
the
boots
which
her
master
wore
at
the
time
of
his
death
and
also
pair
of
the
son’s
though
not
the
pair
which
he
had
then
had
having
measured
these
very
carefully
from
seven
or
eight
different
points
holmes
desired
to
be
led
to
the
court
yard
from
which
we
all
followed
the
winding
track
which
led
to
boscombe
pool
sherlock
holmes
was
transformed
when
he
was
hot
upon
such
scent
as
this
men
who
had
only
known
the
quiet
thinker
and
logician
of
baker
street
would
have
failed
to
recognise
him
his
face
flushed
and
darkened
his
brows
were
drawn
into
two
hard
black
lines
while
his
eyes
shone
out
from
beneath
them
with
steely
glitter
his
face
was
bent
downward
his
shoulders
bowed
his
lips
compressed
and
the
veins
stood
out
like
whipcord
in
his
long
sinewy
neck
his
nostrils
seemed
to
dilate
with
purely
animal
lust
for
the
chase
and
his
mind
was
so
absolutely
concentrated
upon
the
matter
before
him
that
question
or
remark
fell
unheeded
upon
his
ears
or
at
the
most
only
provoked
quick
impatient
snarl
in
reply
swiftly
and
silently
he
made
his
way
along
the
track
which
ran
through
the
meadows
and
so
by
way
of
the
woods
to
the
boscombe
pool
it
was
damp
marshy
ground
as
is
all
that
district
and
there
were
marks
of
many
feet
both
upon
the
path
and
amid
the
short
grass
which
bounded
it
on
either
side
sometimes
holmes
would
hurry
on
sometimes
stop
dead
and
once
he
made
quite
little
detour
into
the
meadow
lestrade
and
walked
behind
him
the
detective
indifferent
and
contemptuous
while
watched
my
friend
with
the
interest
which
sprang
from
the
conviction
that
every
one
of
his
actions
was
directed
towards
definite
end
the
boscombe
pool
which
is
little
reed
girt
sheet
of
water
some
fifty
yards
across
is
situated
at
the
boundary
between
the
hatherley
farm
and
the
private
park
of
the
wealthy
mr
turner
above
the
woods
which
lined
it
upon
the
farther
side
we
could
see
the
red
jutting
pinnacles
which
marked
the
site
of
the
rich
landowner’s
dwelling
on
the
hatherley
side
of
the
pool
the
woods
grew
very
thick
and
there
was
narrow
belt
of
sodden
grass
twenty
paces
across
between
the
edge
of
the
trees
and
the
reeds
which
lined
the
lake
lestrade
showed
us
the
exact
spot
at
which
the
body
had
been
found
and
indeed
so
moist
was
the
ground
that
could
plainly
see
the
traces
which
had
been
left
by
the
fall
of
the
stricken
man
to
holmes
as
could
see
by
his
eager
face
and
peering
eyes
very
many
other
things
were
to
be
read
upon
the
trampled
grass
he
ran
round
like
dog
who
is
picking
up
scent
and
then
turned
upon
my
companion
“What
did
you
go
into
the
pool
for
he
asked
“I
fished
about
with
rake
thought
there
might
be
some
weapon
or
other
trace
but
how
on
earth—”
“Oh
tut
have
no
time
that
left
foot
of
yours
with
its
inward
twist
is
all
over
the
place
mole
could
trace
it
and
there
it
vanishes
among
the
reeds
oh
how
simple
it
would
all
have
been
had
been
here
before
they
came
like
herd
of
buffalo
and
wallowed
all
over
it
here
is
where
the
party
with
the
lodge
keeper
came
and
they
have
covered
all
tracks
for
six
or
eight
feet
round
the
body
but
here
are
three
separate
tracks
of
the
same
feet
he
drew
out
lens
and
lay
down
upon
his
waterproof
to
have
better
view
talking
all
the
time
rather
to
himself
than
to
us
“These
are
young
mcCarthy’s
feet
twice
he
was
walking
and
once
he
ran
swiftly
so
that
the
soles
are
deeply
marked
and
the
heels
hardly
visible
that
bears
out
his
story
he
ran
when
he
saw
his
father
on
the
ground
then
here
are
the
father’s
feet
as
he
paced
up
and
down
what
is
this
then
it
is
the
butt
end
of
the
gun
as
the
son
stood
listening
and
this
ha
what
have
we
here
tiptoes
square
too
quite
unusual
boots
they
come
they
go
they
come
again
of
course
that
was
for
the
cloak
now
where
did
they
come
from
he
ran
up
and
down
sometimes
losing
sometimes
finding
the
track
until
we
were
well
within
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
under
the
shadow
of
great
beech
the
largest
tree
in
the
neighbourhood
holmes
traced
his
way
to
the
farther
side
of
this
and
lay
down
once
more
upon
his
face
with
little
cry
of
satisfaction
for
long
time
he
remained
there
turning
over
the
leaves
and
dried
sticks
gathering
up
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
dust
into
an
envelope
and
examining
with
his
lens
not
only
the
ground
but
even
the
bark
of
the
tree
as
far
as
he
could
reach
jagged
stone
was
lying
among
the
moss
and
this
also
he
carefully
examined
and
retained
then
he
followed
pathway
through
the
wood
until
he
came
to
the
highroad
where
all
traces
were
lost
“It
has
been
case
of
considerable
interest
he
remarked
returning
to
his
natural
manner
“I
fancy
that
this
grey
house
on
the
right
must
be
the
lodge
think
that
will
go
in
and
have
word
with
moran
and
perhaps
write
little
note
having
done
that
we
may
drive
back
to
our
luncheon
you
may
walk
to
the
cab
and
shall
be
with
you
presently
it
was
about
ten
minutes
before
we
regained
our
cab
and
drove
back
into
ross
holmes
still
carrying
with
him
the
stone
which
he
had
picked
up
in
the
wood
“This
may
interest
you
lestrade
he
remarked
holding
it
out
“The
murder
was
done
with
it
“I
see
no
marks
“There
are
none
“How
do
you
know
then
“The
grass
was
growing
under
it
had
only
lain
there
few
days
there
was
no
sign
of
place
whence
it
had
been
taken
it
corresponds
with
the
injuries
there
is
no
sign
of
any
other
weapon
“And
the
murderer
“Is
tall
man
left
handed
limps
with
the
right
leg
wears
thick
soled
shooting
boots
and
grey
cloak
smokes
indian
cigars
uses
cigar
holder
and
carries
blunt
pen
knife
in
his
pocket
there
are
several
other
indications
but
these
may
be
enough
to
aid
us
in
our
search

lestrade
laughed
“I
am
afraid
that
am
still
sceptic
he
said
“Theories
are
all
very
well
but
we
have
to
deal
with
hard
headed
british
jury
“Nous
verrons
answered
holmes
calmly
“You
work
your
own
method
and
shall
work
mine
shall
be
busy
this
afternoon
and
shall
probably
return
to
london
by
the
evening
train
“And
leave
your
case
unfinished
“No
finished
“But
the
mystery
“It
is
solved
“Who
was
the
criminal
then
“The
gentleman
describe
“But
who
is
he
“Surely
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
find
out
this
is
not
such
populous
neighbourhood
lestrade
shrugged
his
shoulders
“I
am
practical
man
he
said
“and
really
cannot
undertake
to
go
about
the
country
looking
for
left
handed
gentleman
with
game
leg
should
become
the
laughing
stock
of
scotland
yard
“All
right
said
holmes
quietly
“I
have
given
you
the
chance
here
are
your
lodgings
good
bye
shall
drop
you
line
before
leave
having
left
lestrade
at
his
rooms
we
drove
to
our
hotel
where
we
found
lunch
upon
the
table
holmes
was
silent
and
buried
in
thought
with
pained
expression
upon
his
face
as
one
who
finds
himself
in
perplexing
position
“Look
here
watson
he
said
when
the
cloth
was
cleared
“just
sit
down
in
this
chair
and
let
me
preach
to
you
for
little
don’t
know
quite
what
to
do
and
should
value
your
advice
light
cigar
and
let
me
expound
“Pray
do
so
“Well
now
in
considering
this
case
there
are
two
points
about
young
mcCarthy’s
narrative
which
struck
us
both
instantly
although
they
impressed
me
in
his
favour
and
you
against
him
one
was
the
fact
that
his
father
should
according
to
his
account
cry
‘Cooee
before
seeing
him
the
other
was
his
singular
dying
reference
to
rat
he
mumbled
several
words
you
understand
but
that
was
all
that
caught
the
son’s
ear
now
from
this
double
point
our
research
must
commence
and
we
will
begin
it
by
presuming
that
what
the
lad
says
is
absolutely
true
“What
of
this
‘Cooee
then
“Well
obviously
it
could
not
have
been
meant
for
the
son
the
son
as
far
as
he
knew
was
in
bristol
it
was
mere
chance
that
he
was
within
earshot
the
‘Cooee
was
meant
to
attract
the
attention
of
whoever
it
was
that
he
had
the
appointment
with
but
‘Cooee’
is
distinctly
australian
cry
and
one
which
is
used
between
australians
there
is
strong
presumption
that
the
person
whom
mcCarthy
expected
to
meet
him
at
boscombe
pool
was
someone
who
had
been
in
australia
“What
of
the
rat
then
sherlock
holmes
took
folded
paper
from
his
pocket
and
flattened
it
out
on
the
table
“This
is
map
of
the
colony
of
victoria
he
said
“I
wired
to
bristol
for
it
last
night
he
put
his
hand
over
part
of
the
map
“What
do
you
read
“ARAT
read
“And
now
he
raised
his
hand
“BALLARAT
“Quite
so
that
was
the
word
the
man
uttered
and
of
which
his
son
only
caught
the
last
two
syllables
he
was
trying
to
utter
the
name
of
his
murderer
so
and
so
of
ballarat
“It
is
wonderful
exclaimed
“It
is
obvious
and
now
you
see
had
narrowed
the
field
down
considerably
the
possession
of
grey
garment
was
third
point
which
granting
the
son’s
statement
to
be
correct
was
certainty
we
have
come
now
out
of
mere
vagueness
to
the
definite
conception
of
an
australian
from
ballarat
with
grey
cloak
“Certainly
“And
one
who
was
at
home
in
the
district
for
the
pool
can
only
be
approached
by
the
farm
or
by
the
estate
where
strangers
could
hardly
wander
“Quite
so
“Then
comes
our
expedition
of
to
day
by
an
examination
of
the
ground
gained
the
trifling
details
which
gave
to
that
imbecile
lestrade
as
to
the
personality
of
the
criminal
“But
how
did
you
gain
them
“You
know
my
method
it
is
founded
upon
the
observation
of
trifles
“His
height
know
that
you
might
roughly
judge
from
the
length
of
his
stride
his
boots
too
might
be
told
from
their
traces
“Yes
they
were
peculiar
boots
“But
his
lameness
“The
impression
of
his
right
foot
was
always
less
distinct
than
his
left
he
put
less
weight
upon
it
why
because
he
limped
he
was
lame
“But
his
left
handedness
“You
were
yourself
struck
by
the
nature
of
the
injury
as
recorded
by
the
surgeon
at
the
inquest
the
blow
was
struck
from
immediately
behind
and
yet
was
upon
the
left
side
now
how
can
that
be
unless
it
were
by
left
handed
man
he
had
stood
behind
that
tree
during
the
interview
between
the
father
and
son
he
had
even
smoked
there
found
the
ash
of
cigar
which
my
special
knowledge
of
tobacco
ashes
enables
me
to
pronounce
as
an
indian
cigar
have
as
you
know
devoted
some
attention
to
this
and
written
little
monograph
on
the
ashes
of
140
different
varieties
of
pipe
cigar
and
cigarette
tobacco
having
found
the
ash
then
looked
round
and
discovered
the
stump
among
the
moss
where
he
had
tossed
it
was
an
indian
cigar
of
the
variety
which
are
rolled
in
rotterdam
“And
the
cigar
holder
“I
could
see
that
the
end
had
not
been
in
his
mouth
therefore
he
used
holder
the
tip
had
been
cut
off
not
bitten
off
but
the
cut
was
not
clean
one
so
deduced

“Holmes
said
“you
have
drawn
net
round
this
man
from
which
he
cannot
escape
and
you
have
saved
an
innocent
human
life
as
truly
as
if
you
had
cut
the
cord
which
was
hanging
him
see
the
direction
in
which
all
this
points
the
culprit
is—”
“Mr
john
turner
cried
the
hotel
waiter
opening
the
door
of
our
sitting
room
and
ushering
in
visitor
the
man
who
entered
was
strange
and
impressive
figure
his
slow
limping
step
and
bowed
shoulders
gave
the
appearance
of
decrepitude
and
yet
his
hard
deep
lined
craggy
features
and
his
enormous
limbs
showed
that
he
was
possessed
of
unusual
strength
of
body
and
of
character
his
tangled
beard
grizzled
hair
and
outstanding
drooping
eyebrows
combined
to
give
an
air
of
dignity
and
power
to
his
appearance
but
his
face
was
of
an
ashen
white
while
his
lips
and
the
corners
of
his
nostrils
were
tinged
with
shade
of
blue
it
was
clear
to
me
at
glance
that
he
was
in
the
grip
of
some
deadly
and
chronic
disease
“Pray
sit
down
on
the
sofa
said
holmes
gently
“You
had
my
note
“Yes
the
lodge
keeper
brought
it
up
you
said
that
you
wished
to
see
me
here
to
avoid
scandal
“I
thought
people
would
talk
if
went
to
the
hall
“And
why
did
you
wish
to
see
me
he
looked
across
at
my
companion
with
despair
in
his
weary
eyes
as
though
his
question
was
already
answered
“Yes
said
holmes
answering
the
look
rather
than
the
words
“It
is
so
know
all
about
mcCarthy
the
old
man
sank
his
face
in
his
hands
“God
help
me
he
cried
“But
would
not
have
let
the
young
man
come
to
harm
give
you
my
word
that
would
have
spoken
out
if
it
went
against
him
at
the
assizes
“I
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
said
holmes
gravely
“I
would
have
spoken
now
had
it
not
been
for
my
dear
girl
it
would
break
her
heart
it
will
break
her
heart
when
she
hears
that
am
arrested
“It
may
not
come
to
that
said
holmes
“What
“I
am
no
official
agent
understand
that
it
was
your
daughter
who
required
my
presence
here
and
am
acting
in
her
interests
young
mcCarthy
must
be
got
off
however
“I
am
dying
man
said
old
turner
“I
have
had
diabetes
for
years
my
doctor
says
it
is
question
whether
shall
live
month
yet
would
rather
die
under
my
own
roof
than
in
gaol
holmes
rose
and
sat
down
at
the
table
with
his
pen
in
his
hand
and
bundle
of
paper
before
him
“Just
tell
us
the
truth
he
said
“I
shall
jot
down
the
facts
you
will
sign
it
and
watson
here
can
witness
it
then
could
produce
your
confession
at
the
last
extremity
to
save
young
mcCarthy
promise
you
that
shall
not
use
it
unless
it
is
absolutely
needed
“It’s
as
well
said
the
old
man
“it’s
question
whether
shall
live
to
the
assizes
so
it
matters
little
to
me
but
should
wish
to
spare
alice
the
shock
and
now
will
make
the
thing
clear
to
you
it
has
been
long
time
in
the
acting
but
will
not
take
me
long
to
tell
“You
didn’t
know
this
dead
man
mcCarthy
he
was
devil
incarnate
tell
you
that
god
keep
you
out
of
the
clutches
of
such
man
as
he
his
grip
has
been
upon
me
these
twenty
years
and
he
has
blasted
my
life
i’ll
tell
you
first
how
came
to
be
in
his
power
“It
was
in
the
early
’60’s
at
the
diggings
was
young
chap
then
hot
blooded
and
reckless
ready
to
turn
my
hand
at
anything
got
among
bad
companions
took
to
drink
had
no
luck
with
my
claim
took
to
the
bush
and
in
word
became
what
you
would
call
over
here
highway
robber
there
were
six
of
us
and
we
had
wild
free
life
of
it
sticking
up
station
from
time
to
time
or
stopping
the
wagons
on
the
road
to
the
diggings
black
jack
of
ballarat
was
the
name
went
under
and
our

is
still
remembered
in

“One
day
gold
convoy
came
down
from
ballarat
to
melbourne
and
we
lay
in
wait
for
it
and
attacked
it
there
were
six
troopers
and
six
of
us
so
it
was
close
thing
but
we
emptied
four
of
their
saddles
at
the
first
volley
three
of
our
boys
were
killed
however
before
we
got
the
swag
put
my
pistol
to
the
head
of
the
wagon
driver
who
was
this
very
man
mcCarthy
wish
to
the
lord
that
had
shot
him
then
but
spared
him
though
saw
his
wicked
little
eyes
fixed
on
my
face
as
though
to
remember
every
feature
we
got
away
with
the
gold
became
wealthy
men
and
made
our
way
over
to
england
without
being
suspected
there
parted
from
my
old
pals
and
determined
to
settle
down
to
quiet
and
respectable
life
bought
this
estate
which
chanced
to
be
in
the
market
and
set
myself
to
do
little
good
with
my
money
to
make
up
for
the
way
in
which
had
earned
it
married
too
and
though
my
wife
died
young
she
left
me
my
dear
little
alice
even
when
she
was
just
baby
her
wee
hand
seemed
to
lead
me
down
the
right
path
as
nothing
else
had
ever
done
in
word
turned
over
new
leaf
and
did
my
best
to
make
up
for
the
past
all
was
going
well
when
mcCarthy
laid
his
grip
upon
me
“I
had
gone
up
to
town
about
an
investment
and
met
him
in
regent
street
with
hardly
coat
to
his
back
or
boot
to
his
foot
‘Here
we
are

says
he
touching
me
on
the
arm
‘we’ll
be
as
good
as

you

two
of

and
my

there
they

ever
since
there

no

no

no

turn
where

was
his
cunning
grinning
face
at
my
elbow
it
grew
worse
as
alice
grew
up
for
he
soon
saw
was
more
afraid
of
her
knowing
my
past
than
of
the
police
whatever
he
wanted
he
must
have
and
whatever
it
was
gave
him
without
question
land
money
houses
until
at
last
he
asked
thing
which
could
not
give
he
asked
for
alice
“His
son
you
see
had
grown
up
and
so
had
my
girl
and
as
was
known
to
be
in
weak
health
it
seemed
fine
stroke
to
him
that
his
lad
should
step
into
the
whole
property
but
there
was
firm
would
not
have
his
cursed
stock
mixed
with
mine
not
that
had
any
dislike
to
the
lad
but
his
blood
was
in
him
and
that
was
enough

firm
mcCarthy
threatened
braved
him
to
do
his
worst
we
were
to
meet
at
the
pool
midway
between
our
houses
to
talk
it
over
“When
went
down
there
found
him
talking
with
his
son
so
smoked
cigar
and
waited
behind
tree
until
he
should
be
alone
but
as
listened
to
his
talk
all
that
was
black
and
bitter
in
me
seemed
to
come
uppermost
he
was
urging
his
son
to
marry
my
daughter
with
as
little
regard
for
what
she
might
think
as
if
she
were
slut
from
off
the
streets
it
drove
me
mad
to
think
that
and
all
that
held
most
dear
should
be
in
the
power
of
such
man
as
this
could
not
snap
the
bond
was
already
dying
and
desperate
man
though
clear
of
mind
and
fairly
strong
of
limb
knew
that
my
own
fate
was
sealed
but
my
memory
and
my
girl
both
could
be
saved
if
could
but
silence
that
foul
tongue
did
it
mr
holmes
would
do
it
again
deeply
as
have
sinned
have
led
life
of
martyrdom
to
atone
for
it
but
that
my
girl
should
be
entangled
in
the
same
meshes
which
held
me
was
more
than
could
suffer
struck
him
down
with
no
more
compunction
than
if
he
had
been
some
foul
and
venomous
beast
his
cry
brought
back
his
son
but
had
gained
the
cover
of
the
wood
though
was
forced
to
go
back
to
fetch
the
cloak
which
had
dropped
in
my
flight
that
is
the
true
story
gentlemen
of
all
that
occurred
“Well
it
is
not
for
me
to
judge
you
said
holmes
as
the
old
man
signed
the
statement
which
had
been
drawn
out
“I
pray
that
we
may
never
be
exposed
to
such
temptation
“I
pray
not
sir
and
what
do
you
intend
to
do
“In
view
of
your
health
nothing
you
are
yourself
aware
that
you
will
soon
have
to
answer
for
your
deed
at
higher
court
than
the
assizes
will
keep
your
confession
and
if
mcCarthy
is
condemned
shall
be
forced
to
use
it
if
not
it
shall
never
be
seen
by
mortal
eye
and
your
secret
whether
you
be
alive
or
dead
shall
be
safe
with
us
“Farewell
then
said
the
old
man
solemnly
“Your
own
deathbeds
when
they
come
will
be
the
easier
for
the
thought
of
the
peace
which
you
have
given
to

and
shaking
in
all
his
giant
frame
he
stumbled
slowly
from
the
room
“God
help
us
said
holmes
after
long
silence
“Why
does
fate
play
such
tricks
with
poor
helpless
worms
never
hear
of

holmes
james
mcCarthy
was
acquitted
at
the
assizes
on
the
strength
of
number
of
objections
which
had
been
drawn
out
by
holmes
and
submitted
to
the
defending
counsel
old
turner
lived
for
seven
months
after
our
interview
but
he
is
now
dead
and
there
is
every
prospect
that
the
son
and
daughter
may
come
to
live
happily
together
in
ignorance
of
the
black
cloud
which
rests
upon
their
past
the
five
orange
pips
when
glance
over
my
notes
and
records
of
the
sherlock
holmes
cases
between
the
years
’82
and
’90
am
faced
by
so
many
which
present
strange
and
interesting
features
that
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
know
which
to
choose
and
which
to
leave
some
however
have
already
gained
publicity
through
the
papers
and
others
have
not
offered
field
for
those
peculiar
qualities
which
my
friend
possessed
in
so
high
degree
and
which
it
is
the
object
of
these
papers
to
illustrate
some
too
have
baffled
his
analytical
skill
and
would
be
as
narratives
beginnings
without
an
ending
while
others
have
been
but
partially
cleared
up
and
have
their
explanations
founded
rather
upon
conjecture
and
surmise
than
on
that
absolute
logical
proof
which
was
so
dear
to
him
there
is
however
one
of
these
last
which
was
so
remarkable
in
its
details
and
so
startling
in
its
results
that
am
tempted
to
give
some
account
of
it
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
are
points
in
connection
with
it
which
never
have
been
and
probably
never
will
be
entirely
cleared
up
the
year
’87
furnished
us
with
long
series
of
cases
of
greater
or
less
interest
of
which
retain
the
records
among
my
headings
under
this
one
twelve
months
find
an
account
of
the
adventure
of
the
paradol
chamber
of
the
amateur
mendicant
society
who
held
luxurious
club
in
the
lower
vault
of
furniture
warehouse
of
the
facts
connected
with
the
loss
of
the
british
barque
sophy
anderson
of
the
singular
adventures
of
the
grice
patersons
in
the
island
of
uffa
and
finally
of
the
camberwell
poisoning
case
in
the
latter
as
may
be
remembered
sherlock
holmes
was
able
by
winding
up
the
dead
man’s
watch
to
prove
that
it
had
been
wound
up
two
hours
before
and
that
therefore
the
deceased
had
gone
to
bed
within
that
time
deduction
which
was
of
the
greatest
importance
in
clearing
up
the
case
all
these
may
sketch
out
at
some
future
date
but
none
of
them
present
such
singular
features
as
the
strange
train
of
circumstances
which
have
now
taken
up
my
pen
to
describe
it
was
in
the
latter
days
of
september
and
the
equinoctial
gales
had
set
in
with
exceptional
violence
all
day
the
wind
had
screamed
and
the
rain
had
beaten
against
the
windows
so
that
even
here
in
the
heart
of
great
hand
made
london
we
were
forced
to
raise
our
minds
for
the
instant
from
the
routine
of
life
and
to
recognise
the
presence
of
those
great
elemental
forces
which
shriek
at
mankind
through
the
bars
of
his
civilisation
like
untamed
beasts
in
cage
as
evening
drew
in
the
storm
grew
higher
and
louder
and
the
wind
cried
and
sobbed
like
child
in
the
chimney
sherlock
holmes
sat
moodily
at
one
side
of
the
fireplace
cross
indexing
his
records
of
crime
while
at
the
other
was
deep
in
one
of
clark
russell’s
fine
sea
stories
until
the
howl
of
the
gale
from
without
seemed
to
blend
with
the
text
and
the
splash
of
the
rain
to
lengthen
out
into
the
long
swash
of
the
sea
waves
my
wife
was
on
visit
to
her
mother’s
and
for
few
days
was
dweller
once
more
in
my
old
quarters
at
baker
street
“Why

up
at

it
that
it

to

crony

holmes
was
wrong
in
his
conjecture
however
for
there
came
step
in
the
passage
and
tapping
at
the
door
he
stretched
out
his
long
arm
to
turn
the
lamp
away
from
himself

towards
the
vacant
chair

“Come
in
said
he
the
man
who
entered
was
young
some
two
and
twenty
at
the
outside
well
groomed
and
trimly
clad
with
something
of
refinement
and
delicacy
in
his
bearing
the
streaming
umbrella
which
he
held
in
his
hand
and
his
long
shining
waterproof
told
of
the
fierce
weather
through
which
he
had
come
he
looked
about
him
anxiously
in
the
glare
of
the
lamp
and
could
see
that
his
face
was
pale
and
his
eyes
heavy
like
those
of

who
is
weighed
down
with
some
great
anxiety

owe
you
an
apology

raising
his
golden
pince

to
his
eyes

trust
that
am
not

have
brought
some
traces
of
the
storm
and
rain
into
your
snug
chamber

me
your
coat
and
umbrella

holmes
“They
may
rest
here
on
the
hook

will
be
dry
presently
you
have
come
up
from

south
west

“Yes
from

“That
clay
and
chalk
mixture
which
see
upon
your

is
quite
distinctive
“I
have
come
for

“That
is
easily
got
“And

“That
is
not
always
so
easy
“I
have
heard
of
you

heard
from

how
you
saved
him
in
the
tankerville
club
scandal
“Ah
of
course
he
was
wrongfully
accused
of
cheating
at
cards
“He
said
that
you

solve
anything
“He
said
too
much
“That
you
are
never
beaten
“I
have
been
beaten
four
times
three
times
by
men
and
once
by

“But
what
is
that
compared
with
the
number
of
your
successes
“It
is
true
that
have
been
generally
successful
“Then
you
may
be
so
with
me
“I
beg
that
you
will
draw
your
chair
up
to

fire
and
favour
me
with
some
details
as

“It
is
no
ordinary
one
“None

court
of

“And
yet
question
sir
whether
in
all
your

you
have
ever
listened
to
more
mysterious
and
inexplicable
chain
of
events
than
those
which
have
happened
in

holmes

you

pulled
his

up

his
wet
feet
out

john
openshaw
but
my
own
affairs
have
as
far
as
can
understand
little
to
do
with
this
awful
business
it
is
hereditary
matter
so
in
order
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
facts
must
go
back
to
the
commencement
of
the
affair
“You
must
know
that
my
grandfather
had
two
sons
my
uncle
elias
and
my
father
joseph
my
father
had
small
factory
at
coventry
which
he
enlarged
at
the
time
of
the
invention
of
bicycling
he
was
patentee
of
the
openshaw
unbreakable
tire
and
his
business
met
with
such
success
that
he
was
able
to
sell
it
and
to
retire
upon
handsome
competence
“My
uncle
elias
emigrated
to
america
when
he
was
young
man
and
became
planter
in
florida
where
he
was
reported
to
have
done
very
well
at
the
time
of
the
war
he
fought
in
jackson’s
army
and
afterwards
under
hood
where
he
rose
to
be
colonel
when
lee
laid
down
his
arms
my
uncle
returned
to
his
plantation
where
he
remained
for
three
or
four
years
about
1869
or
1870
he
came
back
to
europe
and
took
small
estate
in
sussex
near
horsham
he
had
made
very
considerable
fortune
in
the
states
and
his
reason
for
leaving
them
was
his
aversion
to
the
negroes
and
his
dislike
of
the
republican
policy
in
extending
the
franchise
to
them
he
was
singular
man
fierce
and
quick
tempered
very
foul
mouthed
when
he
was
angry
and
of
most
retiring
disposition
during
all
the
years
that
he
lived
at
horsham
doubt
if
ever
he
set
foot
in
the
town
he
had
garden
and
two
or
three
fields
round
his
house
and
there
he
would
take
his
exercise
though
very
often
for
weeks
on
end
he
would
never
leave
his
room
he
drank
great
deal
of
brandy
and
smoked
very
heavily
but
he
would
see
no
society
and
did
not
want
any
friends
not
even
his
own
brother
“He
didn’t
mind
me
in
fact
he
took
fancy
to
me
for
at
the
time
when
he
saw
me
first
was
youngster
of
twelve
or
so
this
would
be
in
the
year
1878
after
he
had
been
eight
or
nine
years
in
england
he
begged
my
father
to
let
me
live
with
him
and
he
was
very
kind
to
me
in
his
way
when
he
was
sober
he
used
to
be
fond
of
playing
backgammon
and
draughts
with
me
and
he
would
make
me
his
representative
both
with
the
servants
and
with
the
tradespeople
so
that
by
the
time
that
was
sixteen
was
quite
master
of
the
house
kept
all
the
keys
and
could
go
where
liked
and
do
what
liked
so
long
as
did
not
disturb
him
in
his
privacy
there
was
one
singular
exception
however
for
he
had
single
room
lumber
room
up
among
the
attics
which
was
invariably
locked
and
which
he
would
never
permit
either
me
or
anyone
else
to
enter
with
boy’s
curiosity
have
peeped
through
the
keyhole
but
was
never
able
to
see
more
than
such
collection
of
old
trunks
and
bundles
as
would
be
expected
in
such
room
“One
day
it
was
in
march
1883—a
letter
with
foreign
stamp
lay
upon
the
table
in
front
of
the
colonel’s
plate
it
was
not
common
thing
for
him
to
receive
letters
for
his
bills
were
all
paid
in
ready
money
and
he
had
no
friends
of
any
sort
‘From
india
said
he
as
he
took
it
up
‘Pondicherry
postmark
what
can
this
be
opening
it
hurriedly
out
there
jumped
five
little
dried
orange
pips
which
pattered
down
upon
his
plate
began
to
laugh
at
this
but
the
laugh
was
struck
from
my
lips
at
the
sight
of
his
face
his
lip
had
fallen
his
eyes
were
protruding
his
skin
the
colour
of
putty
and
he
glared
at
the
envelope
which
he
still
held
in
his
trembling
hand
‘K
he
shrieked
and
then
‘My
god
my
god
my
sins
have
overtaken
me
‘What
is
it
uncle
cried
‘Death
said
he
and
rising
from
the
table
he
retired
to
his
room
leaving
me
palpitating
with
horror
took
up
the
envelope
and
saw
scrawled
in
red
ink
upon
the
inner
flap
just
above
the
gum
the
letter
three
times
repeated
there
was
nothing
else
save
the
five
dried
pips
what
could
be
the
reason
of
his
overpowering
terror
left
the
breakfast
table
and
as
ascended
the
stair
met
him
coming
down
with
an
old
rusty
key
which
must
have
belonged
to
the
attic
in
one
hand
and
small
brass
box
like
cashbox
in
the
other
‘They
may
do
what
they
like
but
i’ll
checkmate
them
still
said
he
with
an
oath
‘Tell
mary
that
shall
want
fire
in
my
room
to
day
and
send
down
to
fordham
the
horsham
lawyer
“I
did
as
he
ordered
and
when
the
lawyer
arrived
was
asked
to
step
up
to
the
room
the
fire
was
burning
brightly
and
in
the
grate
there
was
mass
of
black
fluffy
ashes
as
of
burned
paper
while
the
brass
box
stood
open
and
empty
beside
it
as
glanced
at
the
box
noticed
with
start
that
upon
the
lid
was
printed
the
treble
which
had
read
in
the
morning
upon
the
envelope
‘I
wish
you
john
said
my
uncle
‘to
witness
my
will
leave
my
estate
with
all
its
advantages
and
all
its
disadvantages
to
my
brother
your
father
whence
it
will
no
doubt
descend
to
you
if
you
can
enjoy
it
in
peace
well
and
good
if
you
find
you
cannot
take
my
advice
my
boy
and
leave
it
to
your
deadliest
enemy
am
sorry
to
give
you
such
two
edged
thing
but
can’t
say
what
turn
things
are
going
to
take
kindly
sign
the
paper
where
mr
fordham
shows
you
“I
signed
the
paper
as
directed
and
the
lawyer
took
it
away
with
him
the
singular
incident
made
as
you
may
think
the
deepest
impression
upon
me
and
pondered
over
it
and
turned
it
every
way
in
my
mind
without
being
able
to
make
anything
of
it
yet
could
not
shake
off
the
vague
feeling
of
dread
which
it
left
behind
though
the
sensation
grew
less
keen
as
the
weeks
passed
and
nothing
happened
to
disturb
the
usual
routine
of
our
lives
could
see
change
in
my
uncle
however
he
drank
more
than
ever
and
he
was
less
inclined
for
any
sort
of
society
most
of
his
time
he
would
spend
in
his
room
with
the
door
locked
upon
the
inside
but
sometimes
he
would
emerge
in
sort
of
drunken
frenzy
and
would
burst
out
of
the
house
and
tear
about
the
garden
with
revolver
in
his
hand
screaming
out
that
he
was
afraid
of
no
man
and
that
he
was
not
to
be
cooped
up
like
sheep
in
pen
by
man
or
devil
when
these
hot
fits
were
over
however
he
would
rush
tumultuously
in
at
the
door
and
lock
and
bar
it
behind
him
like
man
who
can
brazen
it
out
no
longer
against
the
terror
which
lies
at
the
roots
of
his
soul
at
such
times
have
seen
his
face
even
on
cold
day
glisten
with
moisture
as
though
it
were
new
raised
from
basin
“Well
to
come
to
an
end
of
the
matter
mr
holmes
and
not
to
abuse
your
patience
there
came
night
when
he
made
one
of
those
drunken
sallies
from
which
he
never
came
back
we
found
him
when
we
went
to
search
for
him
face
downward
in
little
green
scummed
pool
which
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
there
was
no
sign
of
any
violence
and
the
water
was
but
two
feet
deep
so
that
the
jury
having
regard
to
his
known
eccentricity
brought
in
verdict
of
‘suicide
but
who
knew
how
he
winced
from
the
very
thought
of
death
had
much
ado
to
persuade
myself
that
he
had
gone
out
of
his
way
to
meet
it
the
matter
passed
however
and
my
father
entered
into
possession
of
the
estate
and
of
some
£14
000
which
lay
to
his
credit
at
the
bank

“One

of

most
remarkable
to

let
me
have
the
date
of
the
reception
by
your

of
the
letter
and
the
date
of
his
supposed
suicide
“The

you

“When
my
father
took
over
the
horsham
property
he
at
my
request
made
careful
examination
of
the
attic
which
had
been
always
locked
up
we
found
the
brass
box
there
although
its
contents
had
been
destroyed
on
the
inside
of
the
cover
was
paper
label
with
the
initials
of
repeated
upon
it
and
‘Letters
memoranda
receipts
and
register’
written
beneath
these
we
presume
indicated
the
nature
of
the
papers
which
had
been
destroyed
by
colonel
openshaw
for
the
rest
there
was
nothing
of
much
importance
in
the
attic
save
great
many
scattered
papers
and
note
books
bearing
upon
my
uncle’s
life
in
america
some
of
them
were
of
the
war
time
and
showed
that
he
had
done
his
duty
well
and
had
borne
the
repute
of
brave
soldier
others
were
of
date
during
the
reconstruction
of
the
southern
states
and
were
mostly
concerned
with
politics
for
he
had
evidently
taken
strong
part
in
opposing
the
carpet
bag
politicians
who
had
been
sent
down
from
the
north
“Well
it
was
the
beginning
of
’84
when
my
father
came
to
live
at
horsham
and
all
went
as
well
as
possible
with
us
until
the
january
of
’85
on
the
fourth
day
after
the
new
year
heard
my
father
give
sharp
cry
of
surprise
as
we
sat
together
at
the
breakfast
table
there
he
was
sitting
with
newly
opened
envelope
in
one
hand
and
five
dried
orange
pips
in
the
outstretched
palm
of
the
other
one
he
had
always
laughed
at
what
he
called
my
cock
and
bull
story
about
the
colonel
but
he
looked
very
scared
and
puzzled
now
that
the
same
thing
had
come
upon
himself
‘Why
what
on
earth
does
this
mean
john
he
stammered
“My
heart
had
turned
to
lead
‘It
is
said
“He
looked
inside
the
envelope
‘So
it
is
he
cried
‘Here
are
the
very
letters
but
what
is
this
written
above
them
‘Put
the
papers
on
the
sundial
read
peeping
over
his
shoulder
‘What
papers
what
sundial
he
asked
‘The
sundial
in
the
garden
there
is
no
other
said
‘but
the
papers
must
be
those
that
are
destroyed
‘Pooh
said
he
gripping
hard
at
his
courage
‘We
are
in
civilised
land
here
and
we
can’t
have
tomfoolery
of
this
kind
where
does
the
thing
come
from
‘From
dundee
answered
glancing
at
the
postmark
‘Some
preposterous
practical
joke
said
he
‘What
have
to
do
with
sundials
and
papers
shall
take
no
notice
of
such
nonsense
‘I
should
certainly
speak
to
the
police
said
‘And
be
laughed
at
for
my
pains
nothing
of
the
sort
‘Then
let
me
do
so
‘No
forbid
you
won’t
have
fuss
made
about
such
nonsense
“It
was
in
vain
to
argue
with
him
for
he
was
very
obstinate
man
went
about
however
with
heart
which
was
full
of
forebodings
“On
the
third
day
after
the
coming
of
the
letter
my
father
went
from
home
to
visit
an
old
friend
of
his
major
freebody
who
is
in
command
of
one
of
the
forts
upon
portsdown
hill
was
glad
that
he
should
go
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
farther
from
danger
when
he
was
away
from
home
in
that
however
was
in
error
upon
the
second
day
of
his
absence
received
telegram
from
the
major
imploring
me
to
come
at
once
my
father
had
fallen
over
one
of
the
deep
chalk
pits
which
abound
in
the
neighbourhood
and
was
lying
senseless
with
shattered
skull
hurried
to
him
but
he
passed
away
without
having
ever
recovered
his
consciousness
he
had
as
it
appears
been
returning
from
fareham
in
the
twilight
and
as
the
country
was
unknown
to
him
and
the
chalk
pit
unfenced
the
jury
had
no
hesitation
in
bringing
in
verdict
of
‘death
from
accidental
causes
carefully
as
examined
every
fact
connected
with
his
death
was
unable
to
find
anything
which
could
suggest
the
idea
of
murder
there
were
no
signs
of
violence
no
footmarks
no
robbery
no
record
of
strangers
having
been
seen
upon
the
roads
and
yet
need
not
tell
you
that
my
mind
was
far
from
at
ease
and
that
was
well
nigh
certain
that
some
foul
plot
had
been
woven
round
him
“In
this
sinister
way
came
into
my
inheritance
you
will
ask
me
why
did
not
dispose
of
it
answer
because
was
well
convinced
that
our
troubles
were
in
some
way
dependent
upon
an
incident
in
my
uncle’s
life
and
that
the
danger
would
be
as
pressing
in
one
house
as
in
another
“It
was
in
january
’85
that
my
poor
father
met
his
end
and
two
years
and
eight
months
have
elapsed
since
then
during
that
time
have
lived
happily
at
horsham
and
had
begun
to
hope
that
this
curse
had
passed
away
from
the
family
and
that
it
had
ended
with
the
last
generation
had
begun
to
take
comfort
too
soon
however
yesterday
morning
the
blow
fell
in
the
very
shape
in
which
it
had
come
upon
my
father
the
young
man
took
from
his
waistcoat
crumpled
envelope
and
turning
to
the
table
he
shook
out
upon
it
five
little
dried
orange
pips
“This
is
the
envelope
he
continued
“The
postmark
is

eastern

the
very
words
which
were
upon
my
father’s
last
message
‘K
and
then
‘Put
the

on
the
sundial
“What
have
you
done
asked
holmes
“Nothing
“To
tell
the
truth”—he
sank
his
face
into
his
thin
white
hands—“I
have
felt
helpless
have
felt
like
one
of
those
poor
rabbits
when
the
snake
is
writhing
towards
it
seem
to
be
in
the
grasp
of
some
resistless
inexorable
evil
which
no
foresight
and
no
precautions
can
guard
against
“Tut
tut
cried
sherlock
holmes
“You
must
act
man
or
you
are
lost
nothing
but
energy
can
save
you
this
is
no
time
for
despair
“I
have
seen
the
police
“Ah
“But
they
listened
to
my
story
with
smile
am
convinced
that
the
inspector
has
formed
the
opinion
that
the
letters
are
all
practical
jokes
and
that
the
deaths
of
my
relations
were
really
accidents
as
the
jury
stated
and
were
not
to
be
connected
with
the
warnings
holmes
shook
his
clenched
hands
in
the
air
“Incredible
imbecility
he
cried
“They
have
however
allowed
me
policeman
who
may
remain
in
the
house
with
me
“Has
he
come
with
you
to
night
“No
his
orders
were
to
stay
in
the
house
again
holmes
raved
in
the
air
“Why
did
you
come
to
me
he
cried
“and
above
all
why
did
you
not
come
at
once
“I
did
not
know
it
was
only
to
day
that
spoke
to
major
prendergast
about
my
troubles
and
was
advised
by
him
to
come
to
you
“It
is
really
two
days
since
you
had
the
letter
we
should
have
acted
before
this
you
have
no
further
evidence
suppose
than
that
which
you
have
placed
before
us
no
suggestive
detail
which
might
help
us
“There
is
one
thing
said
john
openshaw
he
rummaged
in
his
coat
pocket
and
drawing
out
piece
of
discoloured
blue
tinted
paper
he
laid
it
out
upon
the
table
“I
have
some
remembrance
said
he
“that
on
the
day
when
my
uncle
burned
the
papers
observed
that
the
small
unburned
margins
which
lay
amid
the
ashes
were
of
this
particular
colour
found
this
single
sheet
upon
the
floor
of
his
room
and
am
inclined
to
think
that
it
may
be
one
of
the
papers
which
has
perhaps
fluttered
out
from
among
the
others
and
in
that
way
has
escaped
destruction

the
mention
of

myself
that

my
uncle’s
holmes
moved
the
lamp
and
we
both
bent
over
the
sheet
of
paper
which
showed
by
its
ragged
edge
that
it
had
indeed
been
torn
from
book
it
was
headed
“March
1869
and
beneath
were
the
following
enigmatical
notices

up

it
to
our
visitor
“And
now
you
must
on
no

lose
another

we
cannot
spare
time
even
to
discuss
what
you
have
told
me
you
must
get
home
instantly
and
act
“What
shall
do
“There
is
but
one
thing
to
do
it
must
be
done
at
once
you
must
put
this
piece
of
paper
which
you
have
shown
us
into
the
brass
box
which
you
have
described
you
must
also
put
in
note
to
say
that
all
the
other
papers
were
burned
by
your
uncle
and
that
this
is
the
only
one
which
remains
you
must
assert
that
in
such
words
as
will
carry
conviction
with
them
having
done
this
you
must
at
once
put

we

the

to

the

is
to

splashed

pattered
against

this
strange
wild
story
seemed
to
have
come
to
us
from
amid
the
mad
elements
blown
in
upon
us

sherlock
holmes
sat
for
some
time
in
silence
with
his
head
sunk
forward
and
his
eyes
bent
upon
the
red
glow
of
the
fire
then
he
lit
his
pipe
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
he
watched
the
blue
smoke
rings
as
they
chased
each
other
up
to
the
ceiling
“I
think
watson
he
remarked
at
last
“that
of
all
our
cases
we
have
had
none
more
fantastic
than
this
“Save
perhaps
the
sign
of
four
“Well
yes
save
perhaps
that
and
yet
this
john
openshaw
seems
to
me
to
be
walking
amid
even
greater
perils
than
did
the
sholtos
“But
have
you
asked
“formed
any
definite
conception
as
to
what
these
perils
are
“There
can
be
no
question
as
to
their
nature

answered
“Then
what
are
they
who
is
this
and
why
does
he
pursue
this
unhappy
family
sherlock
holmes
closed
his
eyes
and
placed
his
elbows
upon
the
arms
of
his
chair
with
his
finger
tips
together
“The
ideal
reasoner
he
remarked
“would
when
he
had
once
been
shown
single
fact
in
all
its
bearings
deduce
from
it
not
only
all
the
chain
of
events
which
led
up
to
it
but
also
all
the
results
which
would
follow
from
it
as
cuvier
could
correctly
describe
whole
animal
by
the
contemplation
of
single
bone
so
the
observer
who
has
thoroughly
understood
one
link
in
series
of
incidents
should
be
able
to
accurately
state
all
the
other
ones
both
before
and
after
we
have
not
yet
grasped
the
results
which
the
reason
alone
can
attain
to
problems
may
be
solved
in
the
study
which
have
baffled
all
those
who
have
sought
solution
by
the
aid
of
their
senses
to
carry
the
art
however
to
its
highest
pitch
it
is
necessary
that
the
reasoner
should
be
able
to
utilise
all
the
facts
which
have
come
to
his
knowledge
and
this
in
itself
implies
as
you
will
readily
see
possession
of
all
knowledge
which
even
in
these
days
of
free
education
and
encyclopaedias
is
somewhat
rare
accomplishment
it
is
not
so
impossible
however
that
man
should
possess
all
knowledge
which
is
likely
to
be
useful
to
him
in
his
work
and
this
have
endeavoured
in
my
case
to
do
if
remember
rightly
you
on
one
occasion
in
the
early
days
of
our
friendship
defined
my
limits
in
very
precise
fashion
“Yes

“It
was

were

my
analysis

grinned
at
the
last
item
“Well

now

that

keep

with
all
the

he
is
likely
to

can
put

room
of
his

he
can
get
it
if
he
wants
it
now
for
such
case
as
the
one
which
has
been
submitted
to
us
to
night
we
need
certainly
to
muster
all
our
resources
kindly
hand
me
down
the
letter
of
the
american
encyclopaedia
which
stands
upon
the
shelf
beside
you
thank
you
now
let
us
consider
the
situation
and
see
what
may
be
deduced
from
it
in
the
first
place
we
may
start
with
strong
presumption
that
colonel
openshaw
had
some
very
strong
reason
for
leaving
america
men
at
his
time
of
life
do
not
change
all
their
habits
and
exchange
willingly
the
charming
climate
of
florida
for
the
lonely
life
of
an
english
provincial
town
his
extreme
love
of
solitude
in
england
suggests
the
idea
that
he
was
in
fear
of
someone
or
something
so
we
may
assume
as
working
hypothesis
that
it
was
fear
of
someone
or
something
which
drove
him
from
america
as
to
what
it
was
he
feared
we
can
only
deduce
that
by
considering
the
formidable
letters
which
were
received
by
himself
and
his
successors
did
you
remark
the
postmarks
of
those
letters
“The
first
was
from
pondicherry
the
second
from
dundee
and
the
third
from
london
“From
east
london
what
do
you
deduce
from
that
“They
are
all
seaports
that
the
writer
was
on
board
of
ship
“Excellent
we
have
already
clue
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
probability
the
strong
probability
is
that
the
writer
was
on
board
of
ship
and
now
let
us
consider
another
point
in
the
case
of
pondicherry
seven
weeks
elapsed
between
the
threat
and
its
fulfilment
in
dundee
it
was
only
some
three
or
four
days
does
that
suggest
anything
“A
greater
distance
to
travel
“But
the
letter
had
also
greater
distance
to
come
“Then
do
not
see
the
point
“There
is
at
least
presumption
that
the
vessel
in
which
the
man
or
men
are
is
sailing
ship
it
looks
as
if
they
always
send
their
singular
warning
or
token
before
them
when
starting
upon
their
mission
you
see
how
quickly
the
deed
followed
the
sign
when
it
came
from
dundee
if
they
had
come
from
pondicherry
in
steamer
they
would
have
arrived
almost
as
soon
as
their
letter
but
as
matter
of
fact
seven
weeks
elapsed
think
that
those
seven
weeks
represented
the
difference
between
the
mail
boat
which
brought
the
letter
and
the
sailing
vessel
which
brought
the
writer
“It
is
possible
“More
than
that
it
is
probable
and
now
you
see
the
deadly
urgency
of
this
new
case
and
why
urged
young
openshaw
to
caution
the
blow
has
always
fallen
at
the
end
of
the
time
which
it
would
take
the
senders
to
travel
the
distance
but
this
one
comes
from
london
and
therefore
we
cannot
count
upon
delay
“Good
god
cried
“What
can
it
mean
this
relentless
persecution
“The
papers
which
openshaw
carried
are
obviously
of
vital
importance
to
the
person
or
persons
in
the
sailing
ship
think
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
there
must
be
more
than
one
of
them
single
man
could
not
have
carried
out
two
deaths
in
such
way
as
to
deceive
coroner’s
jury
there
must
have
been
several
in
it
and
they
must
have
been
men
of
resource
and
determination
their
papers
they
mean
to
have
be
the
holder
of
them
who
it
may
in
this
way
you
see
ceases
to
be
the
initials
of
an
individual
and
becomes
the
badge
of
society
“But
of
what
society
“Have
you
never—”
said
sherlock
holmes
bending
forward
and
sinking
his
voice—“have
you
never
heard
of
the
ku
klux
klan
“I
never
have
holmes
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
book
upon
his
knee
“Here

is

‘Ku

derived
from
the
fanciful
resemblance
to
the
sound
produced
by
cocking

this
terrible
secret
society
was
formed
by
some
ex
confederate
soldiers
in
the
southern
states
after
the
civil
war
and
it
rapidly
formed
local
branches
in
different
parts
of
the
country
notably
in
tennessee
louisiana
the
carolinas
georgia
and
florida
its
power
was
used
for
political
purposes
principally
for
the
terrorising
of
the
negro
voters
and
the
murdering
and
driving
from
the
country
of
those
who
were
opposed
to
its
views
its
outrages
were
usually
preceded
by
warning
sent
to
the
marked

some
fantastic
but
generally
recognised
shape

of
oak

in
some
parts

in

on
receiving
this
the
victim
might
either
openly
abjure
his
former
ways
or
might
fly
from
the
country
if
he
braved
the
matter
out
death
would
unfailingly
come
upon
him
and
usually
in
some
strange
and
unforeseen
manner
so
perfect
was
the
organisation
of
the
society
and
so
systematic
its
methods
that
there
is
hardly
case
upon
record
where
any
man
succeeded
in
braving
it
with
impunity
or
in
which
any
of
its
outrages
were
traced
home
to
the
perpetrators
for
some
years
the
organisation
flourished
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
united
states
government
and
of
the
better
classes
of
the
community
in
the
south
eventually
in
the
year
1869
the
movement
rather
suddenly
collapsed

there

been
sporadic

“You
will
observe
said
holmes
laying
down
the
volume
“that
the
sudden
breaking
up
of
the
society
was
coincident
with
the
disappearance
of
openshaw
from
america
with
their
papers
it
may
well
have
been
cause
and
effect
it
is
no
wonder
that
he
and
his
family
have
some
of
the
more
implacable
spirits
upon
their
track
you
can
understand
that
this
register
and
diary
may
implicate
some
of
the
first
men
in
the
south
and
that
there
may
be
many
who
will
not
sleep
easy
at
night
until
it
is
recovered
“Then
the

we
have

“Is

we
might
expect

in

is
to
do
what
have
told
him
there
is
nothing
more
to
be

or
to
be
done

so
hand
me
over
my
violin
and
let
us
try
to
forget
for
half
an
hour
the
miserable
weather
and
the
still
more
miserable
ways
of
our
fellow
men
it
had
cleared
in
the
morning
and
the
sun
was
shining
with
subdued
brightness
through
the
dim
veil
which
hangs
over
the
great
city
sherlock
holmes
was
already
at
breakfast
when
came
down
“You
will
excuse
me
for
not
waiting
for
you
said
he
“I
have
foresee
very
busy
day
before
me
in
looking
into
this
case
of
young
openshaw’s
“What
steps
will
you
take
asked
“It

very
much

as
waited
lifted
the
unopened
newspaper
from
the
table
and
glanced
my
eye
over
it
rested
upon
heading
which
sent
chill
to
my
heart
“Holmes
cried
“you
are
too
late
“Ah
said
he
laying
down
his
cup
“I
feared
as
much
how
was
it
done
he
spoke
calmly
but
could
see
that
he
was
deeply
moved
“My
eye
caught
the
name
of
openshaw
and
the
heading
‘Tragedy
near
waterloo
bridge
here
is
the
account
‘Between
nine
and
ten
last
night
police
constable
cook
of
the
division
on
duty
near
waterloo
bridge
heard
cry
for
help
and
splash
in
the
water
the
night
however
was
extremely
dark
and
stormy
so
that
in
spite
of
the
help
of
several
passers
by
it
was
quite
impossible
to
effect
rescue
the
alarm
however
was
given
and
by
the
aid
of
the
water
police
the
body
was
eventually
recovered
it
proved
to
be
that
of
young
gentleman
whose
name
as
it
appears
from
an
envelope
which
was
found
in
his
pocket
was
john
openshaw
and
whose
residence
is
near
horsham
it
is
conjectured
that
he
may
have
been
hurrying
down
to
catch
the
last
train
from
waterloo
station
and
that
in
his
haste
and
the
extreme
darkness
he
missed
his
path
and
walked
over
the
edge
of
one
of
the
small
landing
places
for
river
steamboats
the
body
exhibited
no
traces
of
violence
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
deceased
had
been
the
victim
of
an
unfortunate
accident
which
should
have
the
effect
of
calling
the
attention
of
the
authorities
to
the
condition
of
the
riverside
landing
stages
we
sat
in
silence
for
some
minutes
holmes
more
depressed
and
shaken
than
had
ever
seen
him
“That
hurts
my
pride
watson
he
said
at
last
“It
is
petty
feeling
no
doubt
but
it
hurts
my
pride
it
becomes
personal
matter
with
me
now
and
if
god
sends
me
health
shall
set
my
hand
upon
this
gang
that
he
should
come
to
me
for
help
and
that
should
send
him
away
to
his
death—
he
sprang
from
his
chair
and
paced
about
the
room
in
uncontrollable
agitation
with
flush
upon
his
sallow
cheeks
and
nervous
clasping
and
unclasping
of
his
long
thin
hands
“They
must
be
cunning
devils
he
exclaimed
at
last
“How
could
they
have
decoyed
him
down
there
the
embankment
is
not
on
the
direct
line
to
the

crowded

on

but
not
before
all
day
was
engaged
in
my
professional
work
and
it
was
late
in
the
evening
before
returned
to
baker
street
sherlock
holmes
had
not
come
back
yet
it
was
nearly
ten
o’clock
before
he
entered
looking
pale
and
worn
he
walked
up
to
the
sideboard
and
tearing
piece
from
the
loaf
he
devoured
it
voraciously
washing
it
down
with
long
draught
of
water
“You
are
hungry
remarked
“Starving
it
had
escaped
my
memory
have
had
nothing
since
breakfast
“Nothing
“Not
bite
had
no
time
to
think
of
it
“And
how
have
you
succeeded
“Well
“You
have
clue
“I
have
them
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
young
openshaw
shall
not
long
remain
unavenged
why
watson
let
us
put
their
own
devilish
trade
mark
upon
them
it
is
well
thought
of
“What
do
you
mean
he
took
an
orange
from
the
cupboard
and
tearing
it
to
pieces
he
squeezed
out
the
pips
upon
the
table
of
these
he
took
five
and
thrust
them
into
an
envelope
on
the
inside
of
the
flap
he
wrote
“S
for
then
he
sealed
it
and
addressed
it
to
“Captain
james
calhoun

lone
star

georgia
“That
will
await
him
when
he
enters
port
said
he
chuckling
“It
may
give
him
sleepless
night
he
will
find
it
as
sure
precursor
of
his
fate
as
openshaw
did
before
him
“And
who
is
this

calhoun
“The
leader
of
the
gang
shall
have
the
others
but
he
first
“How
did
you
trace
it
then
he
took
large
sheet
of
paper
from
his
pocket
all
covered
with
dates
and
names
“I
have
spent
the
whole
day
said
he
“over
lloyd’s
registers
and
files
of
the
old
papers
following
the
future
career
of
every
vessel
which
touched
at
pondicherry
in
january
and
february
in
’83
there
were
thirty
six
ships
of
fair
tonnage
which
were
reported
there
during
those
months
of
these
one
the
lone
star
instantly
attracted
my
attention
since
although
it
was
reported
as
having
cleared
from
london
the
name
is
that
which
is
given
to
one
of
the
states
of
the
union
“Texas
think
“I
was
not
and
am
not
sure
which
but
knew
that
the
ship
must
have
an
american
origin
“What
then
“I
searched
the
dundee
records
and
when
found
that
the
barque
lone
star
was
there
in
january
’85
my
suspicion
became
certainty
then
inquired
as
to
the
vessels
which
lay
at
present
in
the
port
of
london
“Yes
“The
lone
star
had
arrived
here
last
week
went
down
to
the
albert
dock
and
found
that
she
had
been
taken
down
the
river
by
the
early
tide
this
morning
homeward
bound
to
savannah
wired
to
gravesend
and
learned
that
she
had
passed
some
time
ago
and
as
the
wind
is
easterly
have
no
doubt
that
she
is
now
past
the
goodwins
and
not
very
far
from
the

of

“What
will
you
do
then
“Oh
have
my

he
and
the

are
as

the
only
native

in

the
others
are

and
germans
know
also
that
they
were
all
three
away
from
the
ship

night
had
it
from
the
stevedore
who
has
been
loading
their
cargo
by
the
time
that
their
sailing
ship
reaches

the
mail
boat
will
have
carried
this
letter

the
cable
will
have
informed
the
police
of
savannah
that
these
three
gentlemen
are
badly
wanted
here
upon
charge
of
murder
there
is
ever
flaw
however
in
the
best
laid
of
human
plans
and
the
murderers
of
john
openshaw
were
never
to
receive
the
orange
pips
which
would
show
them
that
another
as
cunning
and
as
resolute
as
themselves
was
upon
their
track
very
long
and
very
severe
were
the
equinoctial
gales
that
year
we
waited
long
for
news
of
the
lone
star
of
savannah
but
none
ever
reached
us
we
did
at
last
hear
that
somewhere
far
out
in
the
atlantic
shattered
stern
post
of
boat
was
seen
swinging
in
the
trough
of
wave
with
the
letters

principal
of
the
theological
college

was
much
addicted
to
opium
the
habit
grew
upon
him
as
understand
from
some
foolish
freak
when
he
was
at
college
for
having
read
de
quincey’s
description
of
his
dreams

he
had
drenched
his
tobacco
with

found

many
more
have
done
that
the

easier

one
night
it
was
in
june
’89—there
came
ring
to
my
bell
about
the
hour
when
man
gives
his
first
yawn
and
glances
at
the
clock
sat
up
in
my
chair
and
my
wife
laid
her
needle
work
down
in
her
lap
and
made
little
face
of
disappointment
“A
patient
said
she
“You’ll
have
to
go
out
groaned
for
was
newly
come
back
from
weary
day
we
heard
the
door
open
few
hurried
words
and
then
quick
steps
upon
the
linoleum
our
own
door
flew
open
and
lady
clad
in
some
dark
coloured
stuff
with
black
veil
entered
the
room
“You
will
excuse
my
calling
so
late
she
began
and
then
suddenly
losing
her
self
control
she
ran
forward
threw
her
arms
about
my
wife’s
neck
and
sobbed
upon
her
shoulder
“Oh
i’m
in
such
trouble
she
cried
“I
do
so
want
little
help
“Why
said
my
wife
pulling
up
her
veil
“it
is
kate
whitney
how
you
startled
me
kate
had
not
an
idea
who
you
were
when
you
came
in
“I
didn’t
know
what
to
do
so
came
straight
to
you
that
was
always
the
way
folk
who
were
in
grief
came
to
my
wife
like
birds
to
light
house
“It
was
very
sweet
of
you
to
come
now
you
must
have
some
wine
and
water
and
sit
here
comfortably
and
tell
us
all
about
it
or
should
you
rather
that
sent
james
off
to
bed
“Oh
no
want
the
doctor’s
advice
and
help
too
it’s
about
isa
he
has
not
been
home
for
two
days
am
so
frightened
about
him
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
she
had
spoken
to
us
of
her
husband’s
trouble
to
me
as
doctor
to
my
wife
as
an
old
friend
and
school
companion
we
soothed
and
comforted
her
by
such
words
as
we
could
find
did
she
know
where
her
husband
was
it
possible
that
we
could
bring
him
back
to
her
it
seems
that
it
was
she
had
the
surest
information
that
of
late
he
had
when
the
fit
was
on
him
made
use
of
an
opium
den
in
the
farthest
east
of
the
city
hitherto
his
orgies
had
always
been
confined
to
one
day
and
he
had
come
back
twitching
and
shattered
in
the
evening
but
now
the
spell
had
been
upon
him
eight
and
forty
hours
and
he
lay
there
doubtless
among
the
dregs
of
the
docks
breathing
in
the
poison
or
sleeping
off
the
effects
there
he
was
to
be
found
she
was
sure
of
it
at
the
bar
of
gold
in
upper
swandam
lane
but
what
was
she
to
do
how
could
she
young
and
timid
woman
make
her
way
into
such
place
and
pluck
her
husband
out
from
among
the
ruffians
who
surrounded
him
there
was
the
case
and
of
course
there
was
but
one
way
out
of
it
might
not
escort
her
to
this
place
and
then
as
second
thought
why
should
she
come
at
all
was
isa
whitney’s
medical
adviser
and
as
such
had
influence
over
him
could
manage
it
better
if
were
alone
promised
her
on
my
word
that
would
send
him
home
in
cab
within
two
hours
if
he
were
indeed
at
the
address
which
she
had
given
me
and
so
in
ten
minutes
had
left
my
armchair
and
cheery
sitting
room
behind
me
and
was
speeding
eastward
in
hansom
on
strange
errand
as
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
though
the
future
only
could
show
how
strange
it
was
to
be
but
there
was
no
great
difficulty
in
the
first
stage
of
my
adventure
upper
swandam
lane
is
vile
alley
lurking
behind
the
high
wharves
which
line
the
north
side
of
the
river
to
the
east
of
london
bridge
between
slop
shop
and
gin
shop
approached
by
steep
flight
of
steps
leading
down
to
black
gap
like
the
mouth
of
cave
found
the
den
of
which
was
in
search
ordering
my
cab
to
wait
passed
down
the
steps
worn
hollow
in
the
centre
by
the
ceaseless
tread
of
drunken
feet
and
by
the
light
of
flickering
oil
lamp
above
the
door
found
the
latch
and
made
my
way
into
long
low
room
thick
and
heavy
with
the
brown
opium
smoke
and
terraced
with
wooden
berths
like
the
forecastle
of
an
emigrant
ship
through
the
gloom
one
could
dimly
catch
glimpse
of
bodies
lying
in
strange
fantastic
poses
bowed
shoulders
bent
knees
heads
thrown
back
and
chins
pointing
upward
with
here
and
there
dark
lack
lustre
eye
turned
upon
the
newcomer
out
of
the
black
shadows
there
glimmered
little
red
circles
of
light
now
bright
now
faint
as
the
burning
poison
waxed
or
waned
in
the
bowls
of
the
metal
pipes
the
most
lay
silent
but
some
muttered
to
themselves
and
others
talked
together
in
strange
low
monotonous
voice
their
conversation
coming
in
gushes
and
then
suddenly
tailing
off
into
silence
each
mumbling
out
his
own
thoughts
and
paying
little
heed
to
the
words
of
his
neighbour
at
the
farther
end
was
small
brazier
of
burning
charcoal
beside
which
on
three
legged
wooden
stool
there
sat
tall
thin
old
man
with
his
jaw
resting
upon
his
two
fists
and
his
elbows
upon
his
knees
staring
into
the
fire
as
entered
sallow
malay
attendant
had
hurried
up
with
pipe
for
me
and
supply
of
the
drug
beckoning
me
to
an
empty
berth
“Thank
you
have
not
come
to
stay
said
“There
is
friend
of
mine
here
mr
isa
whitney
and
wish
to
speak
with
him
there
was
movement
and
an
exclamation
from
my
right
and
peering
through
the
gloom
saw
whitney
pale
haggard
and
unkempt
staring
out
at
me
“My
god
it’s
watson
said
he
was
in
pitiable
state
of
reaction
with
every
nerve
in
twitter
“I
say
watson
what
o’clock
is
it
“Nearly
eleven
“Of
what
day
“Of
friday
june
19th
“Good
heavens
thought
it
was
wednesday
it
is
wednesday
what
d’you
want
to
frighten
chap
for
he
sank
his
face
onto
his
arms
and
began
to
sob
in
high
treble
key
“I
tell
you
that
it
is
friday
man
your
wife
has
been
waiting
this
two
days
for
you
should
be
ashamed
of
yourself
“So
am
but
you’ve
got
mixed
watson
for
have
only
been
here
few
hours
three
pipes
four
pipes
forget
how
many
but
i’ll
go
home
with
you
wouldn’t
frighten
kate
poor
little
kate
give
me
your
hand
have
you
cab
“Yes
have
one
waiting
“Then
shall
go
in
it
but
must
owe
something
find
what
owe
watson
am
all
off
colour
can
do
nothing
for
myself
walked
down
the
narrow
passage
between
the
double
row
of
sleepers
holding
my
breath
to
keep
out
the
vile
stupefying
fumes
of
the
drug
and
looking
about
for
the
manager
as
passed
the
tall
man
who
sat
by
the
brazier
felt
sudden
pluck
at
my
skirt
and
low
voice
whispered
“Walk
past
me
and
then
look
back
at
me
the
words
fell
quite
distinctly
upon
my
ear
glanced
down
they
could
only
have
come
from
the
old
man
at
my
side
and
yet
he
sat
now
as
absorbed
as
ever
very
thin
very
wrinkled
bent
with
age
an
opium
pipe
dangling
down
from
between
his
knees
as
though
it
had
dropped
in
sheer
lassitude
from
his
fingers
took
two
steps
forward
and
looked
back
it
took
all
my
self
control
to
prevent
me
from
breaking
out
into
cry
of
astonishment
he
had
turned
his
back
so
that
none
could
see
him
but
his
form
had
filled
out
his
wrinkles
were
gone
the
dull
eyes
had
regained
their
fire
and
there
sitting
by
the
fire
and
grinning
at
my
surprise
was
none
other
than
sherlock
holmes
he
made
slight
motion
to
me
to
approach
him
and
instantly
as
he
turned
his
face
half
round
to
the
company
once
more
subsided
into
doddering
loose
lipped
senility
“Holmes
whispered
“what
on
earth
are
you
doing
in
this
den
“As
low
as
you
can
he
answered
“I
have
excellent
ears
if
you
would
have
the
great
kindness
to
get
rid
of
that
sottish
friend
of
yours
should
be
exceedingly
glad
to
have
little
talk
with
you
“I
have
cab
outside
“Then
pray
send
him
home
in
it
you
may
safely
trust
him
for
he
appears
to
be
too
limp
to
get
into
any
mischief
should
recommend
you
also
to
send
note
by
the
cabman
to
your
wife
to
say
that
you
have
thrown
in
your
lot
with
me
if
you
will
wait
outside
shall
be
with
you
in
five
minutes
it
was
difficult
to
refuse
any
of
sherlock
holmes’
requests
for
they
were
always
so
exceedingly
definite
and
put
forward
with
such
quiet
air
of
mastery
felt
however
that
when
whitney
was
once
confined
in
the
cab
my
mission
was
practically
accomplished
and
for
the
rest
could
not
wish
anything
better
than
to
be
associated
with
my
friend
in
one
of
those
singular
adventures
which
were
the
normal
condition
of
his
existence
in
few
minutes
had
written
my
note
paid
whitney’s
bill
led
him
out
to
the
cab
and
seen
him
driven
through
the
darkness
in
very
short
time
decrepit
figure
had
emerged
from
the
opium
den
and
was
walking
down
the
street
with
sherlock
holmes
for
two
streets
he
shuffled
along
with
bent
back
and
an
uncertain
foot
then
glancing
quickly
round
he
straightened
himself
out
and
burst
into
hearty
fit
of
laughter
“I
suppose
watson
said
he
“that
you
imagine
that
have
added
opium
smoking
to
cocaine
injections
and
all
the
other
little
weaknesses
on
which
you
have
favoured
me
with
your
medical
views

watson
am
in
the
midst
of
very
remarkable
inquiry

have
hoped
to
find
clue
in
the
incoherent
ramblings
of
these
sots
as
have
done
before
now
had
been
recognised
in
that
den
my
life
would
not
have
been
worth

hour’s
purchase

used
it
before
now
for
my
own
purposes
and
the
rascally
lascar
who
runs
it
has
sworn
to
have
vengeance
upon
me
there
is
trap
door
at
the
back
of
that
building
near
the
corner
of
paul’s
wharf
which
could
tell
some
strange
tales
of
what
has
passed
through
it
upon
the
moonless
nights
“What
you
do
not

“Ay

we
should
be
rich

if
we
had
£1000
for
every
poor

put
his
two
forefingers

whistled
shrilly
signal
which
was
answered
by
similar
whistle
from
the
distance
followed
shortly
by
the
rattle
of
wheels
and
the
clink
of
horses’
hoofs
“Now

said
holmes
as
tall

dashed
up
through
the
gloom
throwing
out
two
golden
tunnels

then
he
flicked
the
horse
with
his
whip
and
we
dashed
away
through
the
endless
succession
of
sombre
and
deserted
streets
which
widened
gradually
until
we
were
flying
across
broad
balustraded
bridge
with
the
murky
river
flowing
sluggishly
beneath
us
beyond
lay
another
dull
wilderness
of
bricks
and
mortar
its
silence
broken
only
by
the
heavy
regular
footfall
of
the
policeman
or
the
songs
and
shouts
of
some
belated
party
of
revellers
dull
wrack
was
drifting
slowly
across
the
sky
and
star
or
two
twinkled
dimly
here
and
there
through
the
rifts
of
the
clouds
holmes
drove
in
silence
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
breast
and
the
air
of
man
who
is
lost
in
thought
while
sat
beside
him
curious
to
learn
what
this
new
quest
might
be
which
seemed
to
tax
his
powers
so
sorely
and
yet
afraid
to
break
in
upon
the
current
of
his
thoughts
we
had
driven
several
miles
and
were
beginning
to
get
to
the
fringe
of
the
belt
of
suburban
villas
when
he
shook
himself
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
lit
up
his
pipe
with
the
air
of
man
who
has
satisfied
himself
that
he
is
acting
for
the
best
“You
have
grand
gift
of
silence
watson
said
he
“It
makes
you
quite
invaluable
as
companion
’Pon
my
word
it
is
great
thing
for
me
to
have
someone
to
talk
to
for
my
own
thoughts
are
not
over
pleasant
was
wondering
what
should
say
to
this
dear
little
woman
to
night
when
she
meets
me
at
the
door
“You
forget
that
know
nothing
about
it
“I
shall
just
have
time
to
tell
you
the
facts
of
the
case
before
we
get
to
lee
it
seems
absurdly
simple
and
yet
somehow
can
get
nothing
to
go
upon
there’s
plenty
of
thread
no
doubt
but
can’t
get
the
end
of
it
into
my
hand
now
i’ll
state
the
case
clearly
and
concisely
to
you
watson
and
maybe
you
can
see
spark
where
all
is
dark
to
me
“Proceed
then
“Some
years
ago
to
be
definite
in
may
1884—there
came
to
lee
gentleman
neville
st
clair
by
name
who
appeared
to
have
plenty
of
money
he
took
large
villa
laid
out
the
grounds
very
nicely
and
lived
generally
in
good
style
by
degrees
he
made
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
and
in
1887
he
married
the
daughter
of
local
brewer
by
whom
he
now
has
two
children
he
had
no
occupation
but
was
interested
in
several
companies
and
went
into
town
as
rule
in
the
morning
returning
by
the
14
from
cannon
street
every
night
mr
st
clair
is
now
thirty
seven
years
of
age
is
man
of
temperate
habits
good
husband
very
affectionate
father
and
man
who
is
popular
with
all
who
know
him
may
add
that
his
whole
debts
at
the
present
moment
as
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
ascertain
amount
to
£88
10s
while
he
has
£220
standing
to
his
credit
in
the
capital
and
counties
bank
there
is
no
reason
therefore
to
think
that
money
troubles
have
been
weighing
upon
his
mind
“Last
monday
mr
neville
st
clair
went
into
town
rather
earlier
than
usual
remarking
before
he
started
that
he
had
two
important
commissions
to
perform
and
that
he
would
bring
his
little
boy
home
box
of
bricks
now
by
the
merest
chance
his
wife
received
telegram
upon
this
same
monday
very
shortly
after
his
departure
to
the
effect
that
small
parcel
of
considerable
value
which
she
had
been
expecting
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
offices
of
the
aberdeen
shipping
company
now
if
you
are
well
up
in
your
london
you
will
know
that
the
office
of
the
company
is
in
fresno
street
which
branches
out
of
upper
swandam
lane
where
you
found
me
to
night
mrs
st
clair
had
her
lunch
started
for
the
city
did
some
shopping
proceeded
to
the
company’s
office
got
her
packet
and
found
herself
at
exactly
35
walking
through
swandam
lane
on
her
way
back
to
the
station
have
you
followed
me
so
far
“It
is
very
clear
“If
you
remember
monday
was
an
exceedingly
hot
day
and
mrs
st
clair
walked
slowly
glancing
about
in
the
hope
of
seeing
cab
as
she
did
not
like
the
neighbourhood
in
which
she
found
herself
while
she
was
walking
in
this
way
down
swandam
lane
she
suddenly
heard
an
ejaculation
or
cry
and
was
struck
cold
to
see
her
husband
looking
down
at
her
and
as
it
seemed
to
her
beckoning
to
her
from
second
floor
window
the
window
was
open
and
she
distinctly
saw
his
face
which
she
describes
as
being
terribly
agitated
he
waved
his
hands
frantically
to
her
and
then
vanished
from
the
window
so
suddenly
that
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
had
been
plucked
back
by
some
irresistible
force
from
behind
one
singular
point
which
struck
her
quick
feminine
eye
was
that
although
he
wore
some
dark
coat
such
as
he
had
started
to
town
in
he
had
on
neither
collar
nor
necktie
“Convinced
that
something
was
amiss
with
him
she
rushed
down
the
steps
for
the
house
was
none
other
than
the
opium
den
in
which
you
found
me
to
night
and
running
through
the
front
room
she
attempted
to
ascend
the
stairs
which
led
to
the
first
floor
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
however
she
met
this
lascar
scoundrel
of
whom
have
spoken
who
thrust
her
back
and
aided
by
dane
who
acts
as
assistant
there
pushed
her
out
into
the
street
filled
with
the
most
maddening
doubts
and
fears
she
rushed
down
the
lane
and
by
rare
good
fortune
met
in
fresno
street
number
of
constables
with
an
inspector
all
on
their
way
to
their
beat
the
inspector
and
two
men
accompanied
her
back
and
in
spite
of
the
continued
resistance
of
the
proprietor
they
made
their
way
to
the
room
in
which
mr
st
clair
had
last
been
seen
there
was
no
sign
of
him
there
in
fact
in
the
whole
of
that
floor
there
was
no
one
to
be
found
save
crippled
wretch
of
hideous
aspect
who
it
seems
made
his
home
there
both
he
and
the
lascar
stoutly
swore
that
no
one
else
had
been
in
the
front
room
during
the
afternoon
so
determined
was
their
denial
that
the
inspector
was
staggered
and
had
almost
come
to
believe
that
mrs
st
clair
had
been
deluded
when
with
cry
she
sprang
at
small
deal
box
which
lay
upon
the
table
and
tore
the
lid
from
it
out
there
fell
cascade
of
children’s
bricks
it
was
the
toy
which
he
had
promised
to
bring
home
“This
discovery
and
the
evident
confusion
which
the
cripple
showed
made
the
inspector
realise
that
the
matter
was
serious
the
rooms
were
carefully
examined
and
results
all
pointed
to
an
abominable
crime
the
front
room
was
plainly
furnished
as
sitting
room
and
led
into
small
bedroom
which
looked
out
upon
the
back
of
one
of
the
wharves
between
the
wharf
and
the
bedroom
window
is
narrow
strip
which
is
dry
at
low
tide
but
is
covered
at
high
tide
with
at
least
four
and
half
feet
of
water
the
bedroom
window
was
broad
one
and
opened
from
below
on
examination
traces
of
blood
were
to
be
seen
upon
the
windowsill
and
several
scattered
drops
were
visible
upon
the
wooden
floor
of
the
bedroom
thrust
away
behind
curtain
in
the
front
room
were
all
the
clothes
of
mr
neville
st
clair
with
the
exception
of
his
coat
his
boots
his
socks
his
hat
and
his
watch
all
were
there
were
no
signs
of
violence
upon
any
of
these
garments
and
there
were
no
other
traces
of
mr
neville
st
clair
out
of
the
window
he
must
apparently
have
gone
for
no
other
exit
could
be
discovered
and
the
ominous
bloodstains
upon
the
sill
gave
little
promise
that
he
could
save
himself
by
swimming
for
the
tide
was
at
its
very
highest
at
the
moment
of
the
tragedy

“And
now
as
to
the
villains
who
seemed
to
be
immediately
implicated
in
the
matter
the
lascar
was
known
to
be
man
of
the
vilest
antecedents
but
as
by
mrs
st
clair’s
story
he
was
known
to
have
been
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
within
very
few
seconds
of
her
husband’s
appearance
at
the
window
he
could
hardly
have
been
more
than
an
accessory
to
the
crime
his
defence
was
one
of
absolute
ignorance
and
he
protested
that
he
had
no
knowledge
as
to
the
doings
of
hugh
boone
his
lodger
and
that
he
could
not
account
in
any
way
for
the
presence
of
the
missing
gentleman’s
clothes
“So
much
for
the
lascar
manager
now
for
the
sinister
cripple
who
lives
upon
the
second
floor
of
the
opium
den
and
who
was
certainly
the
last
human
being
whose
eyes
rested
upon
neville
st
clair
his
name
is
hugh
boone
and
his
hideous
face
is
one
which
is
familiar
to
every
man
who
goes
much
to
the
city
he
is
professional
beggar
though
in
order
to
avoid
the
police
regulations
he
pretends
to
small
trade
in
wax
vestas
some
little
distance
down
threadneedle
street
upon
the
left
hand
side
there
is
as
you
may
have
remarked
small
angle
in
the
wall
here
it
is
that
this
creature
takes
his
daily
seat
cross
legged
with
his
tiny
stock
of
matches
on
his
lap
and
as
he
is
piteous
spectacle
small
rain
of
charity
descends
into
the
greasy
leather
cap
which
lies
upon
the
pavement
beside
him
have
watched
the
fellow
more
than
once
before
ever
thought
of
making
his
professional
acquaintance
and
have
been
surprised
at
the
harvest
which
he
has
reaped
in
short
time
his
appearance
you
see
is
so
remarkable
that
no
one
can
pass
him
without
observing
him
shock
of
orange
hair
pale
face
disfigured
by
horrible
scar
which
by
its
contraction
has
turned
up
the
outer
edge
of
his
upper
lip
bulldog
chin
and
pair
of
very
penetrating
dark
eyes
which
present
singular
contrast
to
the
colour
of
his
hair
all
mark
him
out
from
amid
the
common
crowd
of
mendicants
and
so
too
does
his
wit
for
he
is
ever
ready
with
reply
to
any
piece
of
chaff
which
may
be
thrown
at
him
by
the
passers
by
this
is
the
man
whom
we
now
learn
to
have
been
the
lodger
at
the
opium
den
and
to
have
been
the
last
man
to
see
the
gentleman
of
whom
we
are
in
quest
“But
cripple

“What
could
he
have
done
single
handed
against
man
in
the
prime
of
life
“He
is
cripple
in
the
sense
that
he
walks
with
limp
but
in
other
respects
he
appears
to
be
powerful
and
well
nurtured
man
surely
your
medical
experience
would
tell
you
watson
that
weakness
in
one
limb
is
often
compensated
for
by
exceptional
strength
in
the
others
“Pray
continue
your
narrative
“Mrs
st
clair
had
fainted
at
the
sight
of
the
blood
upon
the
window
and
she
was
escorted
home
in
cab
by
the
police
as
her
presence
could
be
of
no
help
to
them
in
their
investigations
inspector
barton
who
had
charge
of
the
case
made
very
careful
examination
of
the
premises
but
without
finding
anything
which
threw
any
light
upon
the
matter
one
mistake
had
been
made
in
not
arresting
boone
instantly
as
he
was
allowed
some
few
minutes
during
which
he
might
have
communicated
with
his
friend
the
lascar
but
this
fault
was
soon
remedied
and
he
was
seized
and
searched
without
anything
being
found
which
could
incriminate
him
there
were
it
is
true
some
blood
stains
upon
his
right
shirt
sleeve
but
he
pointed
to
his
ring
finger
which
had
been
cut
near
the
nail
and
explained
that
the
bleeding
came
from
there
adding
that
he
had
been
to
the
window
not
long
before
and
that
the
stains
which
had
been
observed
there
came
doubtless
from
the
same
source
he
denied
strenuously
having
ever
seen
mr
neville
st
clair
and
swore
that
the
presence
of
the
clothes
in
his
room
was
as
much
mystery
to
him
as
to
the
police
as
to
mrs
st
clair’s
assertion
that
she
had
actually
seen
her
husband
at
the
window
he
declared
that
she
must
have
been
either
mad
or
dreaming
he
was
removed
loudly
protesting
to
the
police
station
while
the
inspector
remained
upon
the
premises
in
the
hope
that
the
ebbing
tide
might
afford
some
fresh
clue
“And
it
did
though
they
hardly
found
upon
the
mud
bank
what
they
had
feared
to
find
it
was
neville
st
clair’s
coat
and
not
neville
st
clair
which
lay
uncovered
as
the
tide
receded
and
what
do
you
think
they
found
in
the
pockets
“I
cannot
imagine
“No
don’t
think
you
would
guess
every
pocket
stuffed
with
pennies
and
half
pennies—421
pennies
and
270
half
pennies
it
was
no
wonder
that
it
had
not
been
swept
away
by
the
tide
but
human
body
is
different
matter
there
is
fierce
eddy
between
the
wharf
and
the
house
it
seemed
likely
enough
that
the
weighted
coat
had
remained
when
the
stripped
body
had
been
sucked
away
into
the
river
“But
understand
that
all
the
other
clothes
were
found
in
the
room
would
the
body
be
dressed
in
coat
alone
“No
sir
but
the
facts
might
be
met
speciously
enough
suppose
that
this
man
boone
had
thrust
neville
st
clair
through
the
window
there
is
no
human
eye
which
could
have
seen
the
deed
what
would
he
do
then
it
would
of
course
instantly
strike
him
that
he
must
get
rid
of
the
tell
tale
garments
he
would
seize
the
coat
then
and
be
in
the
act
of
throwing
it
out
when
it
would
occur
to
him
that
it
would
swim
and
not
sink
he
has
little
time
for
he
has
heard
the
scuffle
downstairs
when
the
wife
tried
to
force
her
way
up
and
perhaps
he
has
already
heard
from
his
lascar
confederate
that
the
police
are
hurrying
up
the
street
there
is
not
an
instant
to
be
lost
he
rushes
to
some
secret
hoard
where
he
has
accumulated
the
fruits
of
his
beggary
and
he
stuffs
all
the
coins
upon
which
he
can
lay
his
hands
into
the
pockets
to
make
sure
of
the
coat’s
sinking
he
throws
it
out
and
would
have
done
the
same
with
the
other
garments
had
not
he
heard
the
rush
of
steps
below
and
only
just
had
time
to
close
the
window
when
the
police
appeared
“It
certainly
sounds
feasible
“Well
we
will
take
it
as
working
hypothesis
for
want
of
better
boone
as
have
told
you
was
arrested
and
taken
to
the
station
but
it
could
not
be
shown
that
there
had
ever
before
been
anything
against
him
he
had
for
years
been
known
as
professional
beggar
but
his
life
appeared
to
have
been
very
quiet
and
innocent
one
there
the
matter
stands
at
present
and
the
questions
which
have
to
be
solved
what
neville
st
clair
was
doing
in
the
opium
den
what
happened
to
him
when
there
where
is
he
now
and
what
hugh
boone
had
to
do
with
his
disappearance
are
all
as
far
from
solution
as
ever
confess
that
cannot
recall
any
case
within
my
experience
which
looked
at
the
first
glance
so
simple
and
yet
which
presented
such
difficulties
while
sherlock
holmes
had
been
detailing
this
singular
series
of
events
we
had
been
whirling
through
the
outskirts
of
the
great
town
until
the
last
straggling
houses
had
been
left
behind
and
we
rattled
along
with
country
hedge
upon
either
side
of
us
just
as
he
finished
however
we
drove
through
two
scattered
villages
where
few
lights
still
glimmered
in
the
windows
“We
are
on
the
outskirts
of
lee
said
my
companion
“We
have
touched
on
three
english
counties
in
our
short
drive
starting
in
middlesex
passing
over
an
angle
of
surrey
and
ending
in
kent
see
that
light
among
the
trees
that
is
the
cedars
and
beside
that
lamp
sits
woman
whose
anxious
ears
have
already
have
little
doubt
caught
the
clink
of
our
horse’s
feet
“But
why
are
you
not
conducting
the
case
from
baker
street
asked
“Because
there
are
many
inquiries
which
must
be
made
out
here
mrs
st
clair
has
most
kindly
put
two
rooms
at
my
disposal
and
you
may
rest
assured
that
she
will
have
nothing
but
welcome
for
my
friend
and
colleague
hate
to
meet
her
watson
when
have
no
news
of
her
husband
here
we
are
whoa
there
whoa
we
had
pulled
up
in
front
of
large
villa
which
stood
within
its
own
grounds
stable
boy
had
run
out
to
the
horse’s
head
and
springing
down
followed
holmes
up
the
small
winding
gravel
drive
which
led
to
the
house
as
we
approached
the
door
flew
open
and
little
blonde
woman
stood
in
the
opening
clad
in
some
sort
of
light
mousseline
de
soie
with
touch
of
fluffy
pink
chiffon
at
her
neck
and
wrists
she
stood
with
her
figure
outlined
against
the
flood
of
light
one
hand
upon
the
door
one
half
raised
in
her
eagerness
her
body
slightly
bent
her
head
and
face
protruded
with
eager
eyes
and
parted
lips
standing
question
“Well
she
cried
“well
and
then
seeing
that
there
were
two
of
us
she
gave
cry
of
hope
which
sank
into
groan
as
she
saw
that
my
companion
shook
his
head
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
“No
good
news
“None
“No
bad
“No
“Thank
god
for
that
but
come
in
you
must
be
weary
for
you
have
had
long
day
“This
is
my
friend
dr
watson
he
has
been
of
most
vital
use
to
me
in
several
of
my
cases
and
lucky
chance
has
made
it
possible
for
me
to
bring
him
out
and
associate
him
with

“I
am
delighted
to
see
you
said
she
pressing
my
hand
warmly
“You
will
am
sure
forgive
anything
that
may
be
wanting
in
our
arrangements
when
you
consider
the
blow
which
has
come
so
suddenly
upon
us
“My
dear
madam
said
“I
am
an
old
campaigner
and
if
were
not
can
very
well
see
that
no
apology
is
needed
if
can
be
of
any
assistance
either
to
you
or
to
my
friend
here
shall
be
indeed
happy
“Now
mr
sherlock
holmes
said
the
lady
as
we
entered
well
lit
dining
room
upon
the
table
of
which
cold
supper
had
been
laid
out
“I
should
very
much
like
to
ask
you
one
or
two
plain
questions
to
which
beg
that
you
will
give
plain
answer
“Certainly
madam
“Do
not
trouble
about
my
feelings
am
not
hysterical
nor
given
to
fainting
simply
wish
to
hear
your
real
opinion
“Upon
what
point
“In
your
heart
of
hearts
do
you
think
that
neville
is
alive
sherlock
holmes
seemed
to
be
embarrassed
by
the
question
“Frankly
now
she
repeated
standing
upon
the
rug
and
looking
keenly
down
at
him
as
he
leaned
back
in
basket
chair
“Frankly
then
madam
do
not
“You
think
that
he
is
dead
“I
do
“Murdered
“I
don’t
say
that
perhaps
“And
on
what
day
did
he
meet
his
death
“On
monday
“Then
perhaps
mr
holmes
you
will
be
good
enough
to
explain
how
it
is
that
have
received
letter
from
him
to
day
sherlock
holmes
sprang
out
of
his
chair
as
if
he
had
been
galvanised
“What
he
roared
“Yes
to
day
she
stood
smiling
holding
up
little
slip
of
paper
in
the
air
“May
see
it
“Certainly
he
snatched
it
from
her
in
his
eagerness
and
smoothing
it
out
upon
the
table
he
drew
over
the
lamp
and
examined
it
intently
had
left
my
chair
and
was
gazing
at
it
over
his
shoulder
the
envelope
was
very
coarse
one
and
was
stamped
with
the
gravesend
postmark
and
with
the
date
of
that
very
day
or
rather
of
the
day
before
for
it
was
considerably
after
midnight
“Coarse
writing
murmured
holmes
“Surely
this
is
not
your
husband’s
writing
madam
“No
but
the
enclosure
is
“I
perceive
also
that
whoever
addressed
the
envelope
had
to
go
and
inquire
as
to
the
address
“How
can
you
tell
that
“The
name
you
see
is
in
perfectly
black
ink
which
has
dried
itself
the
rest
is
of
the
greyish
colour

shows
that

paper
has
been
used

it
had
been
written
straight
off
and
then
blotted
none
would
be

shade
this
man
has
written
the
name
and
there
has
then
been
pause
before
he
wrote
the
address
which
can
only
mean
that
he
was
not
familiar
with
it

of
course
trifle

there
is
nothing

in

upstairs

something
had
happened

would
respond
to

ignorant
of
his
death

have
seen

much

may
be
more
valuable
than
the
conclusion

an
analytical
reasoner
and
in
this
letter
you
certainly
have
very
strong
piece
of
evidence
to
corroborate
your
view
but
if
your
husband
is
alive
and
able
to
write
letters
why
should
he
remain
away
from
you
“I
cannot
imagine
it
is
unthinkable
“And
on

he
made
no
remarks

leaving

“And
you
were

him
in

the

he
might

gave
an
inarticulate
cry

call

it
might
have

at
the
unexpected
sight

might

him

up

suddenly

this
horrible
man

to

at

so

and

bedded

been
placed
at
our
disposal
and
was
quickly
between
the
sheets
for
was
weary
after
my
night
of
adventure
sherlock
holmes
was
man
however
who
when
he
had
an
unsolved
problem
upon
his
mind
would
go
for
days
and
even
for
week
without
rest
turning
it
over
rearranging
his
facts
looking
at
it
from
every
point
of
view
until
he
had
either
fathomed
it
or
convinced
himself
that
his
data
were
insufficient
it
was
soon
evident
to
me
that
he
was
now
preparing
for
an
all
night
sitting
he
took
off
his
coat
and
waistcoat
put
on
large
blue
dressing
gown
and
then
wandered
about
the
room
collecting
pillows
from
his
bed
and
cushions
from
the
sofa
and
armchairs
with
these
he
constructed
sort
of
eastern
divan
upon
which
he
perched
himself
cross
legged
with
an
ounce
of
shag
tobacco
and
box
of
matches
laid
out
in
front
of
him
in
the
dim
light
of
the
lamp
saw
him
sitting
there
an
old
briar
pipe
between
his
lips
his
eyes
fixed
vacantly
upon
the
corner
of
the
ceiling
the
blue
smoke
curling
up
from
him
silent
motionless
with
the
light
shining
upon
his
strong
set
aquiline
features
so
he
sat
as
dropped
off
to
sleep
and
so
he
sat
when
sudden
ejaculation
caused
me
to
wake
up
and
found
the
summer
sun
shining
into
the
apartment
the
pipe
was
still
between
his
lips
the
smoke
still
curled
upward
and
the
room
was
full
of
dense
tobacco
haze
but
nothing
remained
of
the
heap
of
shag
which
had
seen
upon
the
previous
night
“Awake
watson
he
asked
“Yes
“Game
for
morning
drive
“Certainly
“Then
dress
no
one
is
stirring
yet
but
know
where
the
stable
boy
sleeps
and
we
shall
soon
have
the
trap
out
he
chuckled
to
himself
as
he
spoke
his
eyes
twinkled
and
he
seemed
different
man
to
the
sombre
thinker
of
the
previous
night
as
dressed
glanced
at
my
watch
it
was
no
wonder
that
no
one
was
stirring
it
was
twenty
five
minutes
past
four
had
hardly
finished
when
holmes
returned
with
the
news
that
the
boy
was
putting
in
the
horse
“I
want
to
test
little
theory
of
mine
said
he
pulling
on
his
boots
“I
think
watson
that
you
are
now
standing
in
the
presence
of
one
of
the
most
absolute
fools
in
europe
deserve
to
be
kicked
from
here
to
charing
cross
but
think
have
the
key
of
the
affair
now
“And
where
is

“In
the
bathroom
he
answered
“Oh
yes
am
not
joking
he
continued
seeing
my
look
of
incredulity
“I
have
just
been
there
and
have
taken
it
out
and
have
got
it
in
this
gladstone
bag
come
on
my
boy
and
we
shall
see
whether
it
will
not
fit
the
lock
we
made
our
way
downstairs
as
quietly
as
possible
and
out
into
the
bright
morning
sunshine
in
the
road
stood
our
horse
and
trap
with
the
half
clad
stable
boy
waiting
at
the
head
we
both
sprang
in
and
away
we
dashed
down
the
london
road
few
country
carts
were
stirring
bearing
in
vegetables
to
the
metropolis
but
the
lines
of
villas
on
either
side
were
as
silent
and
lifeless
as
some
city
in
dream
“It
has
been
in
some
points
singular
case
said
holmes
flicking
the
horse
on
into
gallop
“I
confess
that
have
been
as
blind
as
mole
but
it
is
better
to
learn
wisdom
late
than
never
to
learn
it
at
all
in
town
the
earliest
risers
were
just
beginning
to
look
sleepily
from
their
windows
as
we
drove
through
the
streets
of
the
surrey
side
passing
down
the
waterloo
bridge
road
we
crossed
over
the
river
and
dashing
up
wellington
street
wheeled
sharply
to
the
right
and
found
ourselves
in
bow
street
sherlock
holmes
was
well
known
to
the
force
and
the
two
constables
at
the
door
saluted
him
one
of
them
held
the
horse’s
head
while
the
other
led
us
in
“Who
is
on
duty
asked
holmes
“Inspector
bradstreet
sir
“Ah
bradstreet
how
are
you
tall
stout
official
had
come
down
the
stone
flagged
passage
in
peaked
cap
and
frogged
jacket
“I
wish
to
have
quiet
word
with
you
bradstreet
“Certainly
mr
holmes
step
into
my
room
here
it
was
small
office
like
room
with
huge
ledger
upon
the
table
and
telephone
projecting
from
the
wall
the
inspector
sat
down
at
his
desk
“What
can
do
for
you
mr
holmes
“I
called
about
that
beggarman
boone
the
one
who
was
charged
with
being
concerned
in
the
disappearance
of
mr
neville
st
clair
of
lee
“Yes
he
was
brought
up
and
remanded
for
further
inquiries
“So
heard
you
have
him
here
“In
the
cells
“Is
he
quiet
“Oh
he
gives
no
trouble
but
he
is
dirty
scoundrel
“Dirty
“Yes
it
is
all
we
can
do
to
make
him
wash
his
hands
and
his
face
is
as
black
as
tinker’s
well
when
once
his
case
has
been
settled
he
will
have
regular
prison
bath
and
think
if
you
saw
him
you
would
agree
with
me
that
he
needed
it
“I
should
like
to
see
him
very
much
“Would
you
that
is
easily
done
come
this
way
you
can
leave
your
bag
“No
think
that
i’ll
take
it
“Very
good
come
this
way
if
you
please
he
led
us
down
passage
opened
barred
door
passed
down
winding
stair
and
brought
us
to
whitewashed
corridor
with
line
of
doors
on
each
side
“The
third
on
the
right
is
his
said
the
inspector
“Here
it
is
he
quietly
shot
back
panel
in
the
upper
part
of
the
door
and
glanced
through
“He
is
asleep
said
he
“You
can
see
him
very
well
we
both
put
our
eyes
to
the
grating
the
prisoner
lay
with
his
face
towards
us
in
very
deep
sleep
breathing
slowly
and
heavily
he
was
middle
sized
man
coarsely
clad
as
became
his
calling
with
coloured
shirt
protruding
through
the
rent
in
his
tattered
coat
he
was
as
the
inspector
had
said
extremely
dirty
but
the
grime
which
covered
his
face
could
not
conceal
its
repulsive
ugliness
broad
wheal
from
an
old
scar
ran
right
across
it
from
eye
to
chin
and
by
its
contraction
had
turned
up
one
side
of
the
upper
lip
so
that
three
teeth
were
exposed
in
perpetual
snarl
shock
of
very
bright
red
hair
grew
low
over
his
eyes
and
forehead
“He’s
beauty
isn’t
he
said
the
inspector
“He
certainly
needs
wash
remarked
holmes
“I
had
an
idea
that
he
might
and
took
the
liberty
of
bringing
the
tools
with
me
he
opened
the
gladstone
bag
as
he
spoke
and
took
out
to
my
astonishment
very
large
bath
sponge
“He
he
you
are
funny

the

“Now
if
you
will
have
the
great
goodness
to
open
that
door
very
quietly

will
soon
make
him
cut
much
more
respectable

“Well
don’t
know
why
not

the
inspector
“He
doesn’t
look

the

he
slipped
his
key
into
the
lock

we
all
very
quietly
entered
the

the
sleeper
half
turned

then
settled
down
once
more
into
deep
slumber
holmes
stooped
to
the
water
jug
moistened
his
sponge
and
then
rubbed
it
twice
vigorously
across
and
down
the
prisoner’s
face
“Let
me
introduce
you
he
shouted
“to
mr
neville
st
clair
of
lee
in
the
county
of
kent
never
in
my
life
have
seen
such
sight
the
man’s
face
peeled
off
under
the
sponge
like
the
bark
from
tree
gone
was
the
coarse
brown
tint
gone
too
was
the
horrid
scar
which
had
seamed
it
across
and
the
twisted
lip
which
had
given
the
repulsive
sneer
to
the
face
twitch
brought
away
the
tangled
red
hair
and
there
sitting
up
in
his
bed
was
pale
sad
faced
refined
looking
man
black
haired
and
smooth
skinned
rubbing
his
eyes
and
staring
about
him
with
sleepy
bewilderment
then
suddenly
realising
the
exposure
he
broke
into
scream
and
threw
himself
down
with
his
face
to
the
pillow
“Great
heavens
cried
the
inspector
“it
is
indeed
the
missing
man
know
him
from
the
photograph
the
prisoner
turned
with
the
reckless
air
of
man
who
abandons
himself
to
his
destiny
“Be
it
so
said
he
“And
pray
what
am
charged
with
“With
making
away
with
mr
neville
st
oh
come
you
can’t
be
charged
with
that
unless
they
make
case
of
attempted
suicide
of
it
said
the
inspector
with
grin
“Well
have
been
twenty
seven
years
in
the
force
but
this
really
takes
the
cake
“If
am
mr
neville
st
clair
then
it
is
obvious
that
no
crime
has
been
committed
and
that
therefore
am
illegally
detained
“No
crime
but
very
great
error
has
been
committed
said
holmes
“You
would
have
done
better
to
have
trusted
you
wife
“It
was
not
the
wife
it
was
the
children
groaned
the
prisoner
“God
help
me
would
not
have
them
ashamed
of
their
father

god

an
exposure
what
can
do
sherlock
holmes
sat
down
beside
him
on
the
couch
and
patted
him
kindly
on
the
shoulder
“If
you
leave
it
to
court
of
law
to
clear
the
matter
up
said
he
“of
course
you
can
hardly
avoid
publicity
on
the
other
hand
if
you
convince
the
police
authorities
that
there
is
no
possible
case
against
you
do
not
know
that
there
is
any
reason
that
the
details
should
find
their
way
into
the

inspector
bradstreet
would
am
sure
make
notes
upon
anything
which
you
might
tell
us
and
submit
it
to
the
proper
authorities
the
case
would
then
never
go
into
court

all
“God
bless
you
cried
the
prisoner
passionately
“I
would
have
endured
imprisonment

even
execution
rather
than
have
left
my
miserable
secret

my

are
the
first
who
have
ever
heard

story
my
father
was
schoolmaster
in
chesterfield
where
received
an
excellent
education
travelled
in
my
youth
took
to
the
stage
and
finally
became
reporter
on
an
evening
paper
in
london
one
day
my
editor
wished
to
have
series
of
articles
upon
begging
in
the
metropolis
and
volunteered
to
supply
them
there
was
the
point
from
which
all
my
adventures
started
it
was
only
by
trying
begging
as
an
amateur
that
could
get
the
facts
upon
which
to
base
my
articles
when
an
actor
had
of
course
learned
all
the
secrets
of
making
up
and
had
been
famous
in
the
green
room
for
my
skill
took
advantage
now
of
my
attainments
painted
my
face
and
to
make
myself
as
pitiable
as
possible
made
good
scar

fixed
one
side
of
my
lip
in
twist
by
the
aid
of
small
slip
of
flesh
coloured
plaster
then
with
red
head
of
hair
and
an
appropriate
dress
took
my
station
in
the
business

of
the
city
ostensibly
as
match
seller
but
really
as
beggar
for
seven
hours
plied
my
trade
and
when
returned
home
in
the
evening
found
to
my
surprise
that
had
received
no
less
than
26s

wrote
my

thought
little

for

had
paid

you
can
imagine

it
was
to
settle
down

work
at

when
knew
that
could

as
much
in

by
smearing
my
face
with
little

laying
my

on

sitting
still

between
my
pride

the

won
at

threw
up

sat
day

in

chosen
inspiring

by
my
ghastly

filling
my
pockets
with
coppers

one
man

my
secret

was
the
keeper
of
low

which
used
to
lodge
in

where
could
every
morning
emerge
as
squalid
beggar

in
the
evenings
transform
myself
into
well
dressed
man

very
soon

sums

not

that
any

in
the
streets
of
london
could
earn
£700
year
which
is
less
than
my
average
takings
but
had
exceptional
advantages
in
my
power
of
making
up

also
in

grew
more

in

little
knew

“Last
monday
had
finished
for

was
dressing
in
my
room
above
the
opium
den
when
looked
out
of
my
window
and
saw
to
my
horror
and
astonishment
that
my
wife
was
standing
in
the
street
with
her
eyes
fixed
full
upon
me
gave
cry
of
surprise
threw
up
my
arms
to
cover
my
face
and
rushing
to
my
confidant
the
lascar
entreated
him
to
prevent
anyone
from
coming
up
to
me
heard
her
voice
downstairs
but
knew
that
she
could
not
ascend
swiftly
threw
off
my
clothes
pulled
on
those
of
beggar
and
put
on
my
pigments
and
wig
even
wife’s
eyes
could
not
pierce
so
complete

but
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
there
might
be
search
in
the
room
and
that
the
clothes
might
betray
me
threw
open
the
window
reopening
by
my
violence
small
cut
which
had
inflicted
upon
myself
in
the
bedroom
that
morning
then
seized
my
coat
which
was
weighted
by
the
coppers
which
had
just
transferred
to
it
from
the
leather
bag
in
which
carried
my
takings
hurled
it
out
of
the
window
and
it
disappeared
into
the
thames
the
other
clothes
would
have
followed
but
at
that
moment
there
was
rush
of
constables
up
the
stair
and
few
minutes
after
found
rather
confess
to
my
relief
that
instead
of
being
identified
as
mr
neville
st
clair
was
arrested
as
his
murderer
“I
do
not
know
that
there
is
anything
else
for
me
to
explain
was
determined
to
preserve
my
disguise
as
long
as
possible
and
hence
my
preference
for
dirty

knowing
that
my
wife
would
be
terribly
anxious
slipped
off
my
ring
and
confided
it
to
the
lascar
at
moment
when
no
constable
was
watching
me
together
with
hurried
scrawl
telling
her
that
she
had
no
cause
to
fear
“That
note
only
reached
her
yesterday
said
holmes
“Good
god
what
week
she
must
have
spent
“The
police
have
watched
this
lascar
said
inspector
bradstreet
“and
can
quite
understand
that
he
might
find
it
difficult
to
post
letter
unobserved
probably
he
handed
it
to
some
sailor
customer
of
his
who
forgot
all
about
it
for
some
days
“That
was
it
said
holmes
nodding
approvingly
“I
have
no
doubt
of
it

have
you
never
been
prosecuted
for
begging
“Many
times

what
was
fine
to
me
“It
must
stop
here

bradstreet
“If

up

must
be
no
more

have
sworn
it
by
the
most
solemn
oaths

take
“In
that
case
think
that
it
is
probable
that
no
further
steps
may
be
taken
but
if
you
are
found
again
then
all
must
come
out
am
sure
mr
holmes
that
we
are
very
much
indebted
to
you
for
having
cleared
the
matter
up
wish
knew
how
you
reach
your
results
“I
reached
this
one
said
my
friend
“by
sitting
upon
five
pillows
and
consuming
an
ounce
of
shag

watson
that
if
we
drive
to
baker

shall

vii
the
adventure
of
the
blue
carbuncle
had
called
upon
my
friend
sherlock
holmes
upon
the
second
morning
after
christmas
with
the
intention
of
wishing
him
the
compliments
of
the
season
he
was
lounging
upon
the
sofa
in
purple
dressing
gown
pipe
rack
within
his
reach
upon
the
right
and
pile
of
crumpled
morning
papers
evidently
newly
studied
near
at
hand
beside
the
couch
was
wooden
chair
and
on
the
angle
of
the
back
hung
very
seedy
and
disreputable
hard
felt
hat
much
the
worse
for
wear
and
cracked
in
several
places
lens
and
forceps
lying
upon
the
seat
of
the
chair
suggested
that
the
hat
had
been
suspended
in
this
manner
for
the
purpose
of
examination
“You
are
engaged
said
“perhaps
interrupt
you
“Not
at
all
am
glad
to
have
friend
with
whom
can
discuss
my
results
the
matter
is
perfectly
trivial
one”—he
jerked
his
thumb
in
the
direction
of
the
old
hat—“but
there
are
points
in
connection
with
it
which
are
not
entirely
devoid
of
interest
and
even
of
instruction
seated
myself
in
his
armchair
and
warmed
my
hands
before
his
crackling
fire
for
sharp
frost
had
set
in
and
the
windows
were
thick
with
the
ice
crystals
“I
suppose
remarked
“that
homely
as
it
looks
this
thing
has
some
deadly
story
linked
on
to
it
that
it
is
the
clue
which
will
guide
you
in
the
solution
of
some
mystery
and
the
punishment
of
some
crime
“No
no
crime
said
sherlock
holmes
laughing
“Only
one
of
those
whimsical
little
incidents
which
will
happen
when
you
have
four
million
human
beings
all
jostling
each
other
within
the
space
of
few
square
miles
amid
the
action
and
reaction
of
so
dense
swarm
of
humanity
every
possible
combination
of
events
may
be
expected
to
take
place
and
many
little
problem
will
be
presented
which
may
be
striking
and
bizarre
without
being
criminal
we
have
already
had
experience
of
such
“So
much
so
remarked
“that
of
the
last
six
cases
which
have
added
to
my
notes
three
have
been
entirely
free
of
any
legal
crime
“Precisely
you
allude
to
my
attempt
to
recover
the
irene
adler
papers
to
the
singular
case
of
miss
mary
sutherland
and
to
the
adventure
of
the
man
with
the
twisted
lip
well
have
no
doubt
that
this
small
matter
will
fall
into
the
same
innocent
category
you
know
peterson
the
commissionaire
“Yes
“It
is
to
him
that
this
trophy
belongs
“It
is
his
hat
“No
no
he
found
it
its
owner
is
unknown
beg
that
you
will
look
upon
it
not
as
battered
billycock
but
as
an
intellectual
problem
and
first
as
to
how
it
came
here
it
arrived
upon
christmas
morning
in
company
with
good
fat
goose
which
is
have
no
doubt
roasting
at
this
moment
in
front
of
peterson’s
fire
the
facts
are
these
about
four
o’clock
on
christmas
morning
peterson
who
as
you
know
is
very
honest
fellow
was
returning
from
some
small
jollification
and
was
making
his
way
homeward
down
tottenham
court
road
in
front
of
him
he
saw
in
the
gaslight
tallish
man
walking
with
slight
stagger
and
carrying
white
goose
slung
over
his
shoulder
as
he
reached
the
corner
of
goodge
street
row
broke
out
between
this
stranger
and
little
knot
of
roughs
one
of
the
latter
knocked
off
the
man’s
hat
on
which
he
raised
his
stick
to
defend
himself
and
swinging
it
over
his
head
smashed
the
shop
window
behind
him
peterson
had
rushed
forward
to
protect
the
stranger
from
his
assailants
but
the
man
shocked
at
having
broken
the
window
and
seeing
an
official
looking
person
in
uniform
rushing
towards
him
dropped
his
goose
took
to
his
heels
and
vanished
amid
the
labyrinth
of
small
streets
which
lie
at
the
back
of
tottenham
court
road
the
roughs
had
also
fled
at
the
appearance
of
peterson
so
that
he
was
left
in
possession
of
the
field
of
battle
and
also
of
the
spoils
of
victory
in
the
shape
of
this
battered
hat
and
most
unimpeachable
christmas
goose
“Which
surely
he
restored
to
their
owner
“My
dear
fellow
there
lies
the
problem
it
is
true
that
‘For
mrs
henry
baker’
was
printed
upon
small
card
which
was
tied
to
the
bird’s
left
leg
and
it
is
also
true
that
the
initials
‘H
are
legible
upon
the
lining
of
this
hat
but
as
there
are
some
thousands
of
bakers
and
some
hundreds
of
henry
bakers
in
this
city
of
ours
it
is
not
easy
to
restore
lost
property
to
any
one
of
them
“What
then
did
peterson
do
“He
brought
round
both
hat
and
goose
to
me
on
christmas
morning
knowing
that
even
the
smallest
problems
are
of
interest
to
me
the
goose
we
retained
until
this
morning
when
there
were
signs
that
in
spite
of
the
slight
frost
it
would
be
well
that
it
should
be
eaten
without
unnecessary
delay
its
finder
has
carried
it
off
therefore
to
fulfil
the
ultimate
destiny
of
goose
while
continue
to
retain
the
hat
of
the
unknown
gentleman
who
lost
his
christmas
dinner
“Did
he
not
advertise
“No
“Then
what
clue
could
you
have
as
to
his
identity
“Only
as
much
as
we
can
deduce
“From
his
hat

you
are

this
article
took
the
tattered
object
in
my
hands
and
turned
it
over
rather
ruefully
it
was
very
ordinary
black
hat
of
the
usual
round
shape
hard
and
much
the
worse
for

the
lining
had
been
of
red
silk

was
good

discoloured
there
was
no
maker’s
name
but
as
holmes
had
remarked
the
initials

scrawled

pierced
in
the

the

the

was
cracked
exceedingly
dusty

spotted
in
several
places

there
seemed
to
have
been
some
attempt
to
hide
the
discoloured
patches

smearing
them
with
ink

handing
it
back
to
my

“On

timid

drawing
your
inferences
“Then
pray
tell
me
what
it
is
that
you
can
infer
from
this
hat
he
picked
it
up
and
gazed
at
it
in
the
peculiar
introspective
fashion
which
was
characteristic
of
him
“It
is
perhaps
less
suggestive
than
it
might
have
been
he
remarked
“and
yet
there
are
few
inferences
which
are
very
distinct
and
few
others
which
represent
at
least
strong
balance
of
probability
that
the
man
was
highly
intellectual
is
of
course
obvious
upon
the
face
of
it
and
also
that
he
was
fairly
well
to
do
within
the
last
three
years
although
he
has
now
fallen
upon
evil
days
he
had
foresight
but
has
less
now
than
formerly
pointing
to
moral
retrogression
which
when
taken
with
the
decline
of
his
fortunes
seems
to
indicate
some
evil
influence
probably
drink
at
work
upon
him
this
may
account
also
for
the
obvious
fact
that
his
wife
has
ceased
to
love
him
“My
dear
holmes
“He
has
however
retained
some
degree
of
self
respect
he
continued
disregarding
my
remonstrance
“He
is
man
who
leads
sedentary
life
goes
out
little
is
out
of
training
entirely
is
middle
aged
has
grizzled
hair
which
he
has
had
cut
within
the
last
few
days
and
which
he
anoints
with
lime
cream
these
are
the
more
patent
facts
which
are
to
be
deduced
from
his
hat
also
by
the
way
that
it
is
extremely
improbable
that
he
has
gas
laid
on
in
his
house
“You
are
certainly
joking
holmes
“Not
in
the
least
is
it
possible
that
even
now
when
give
you
these
results
you
are
unable
to
see
how
they
are
attained
“I
have
no
doubt
that
am
very
stupid
but
must
confess
that
am
unable
to
follow
you
for
example
how
did
you
deduce
that
this
man
was
intellectual
for
answer
holmes
clapped
the
hat
upon
his
head
it
came
right
over
the
forehead
and
settled
upon
the
bridge
of
his
nose
“It
is
question
of
cubic
capacity
said
he
“a
man
with
so
large
brain
must
have
something
in
it
“The
decline
of
his
fortunes
then
“This
hat
is
three
years
old
these
flat
brims
curled
at
the
edge
came
in
then
it
is
hat
of
the
very
best
quality
look
at
the
band
of
ribbed
silk
and
the
excellent
lining
if
this
man
could
afford
to
buy
so
expensive
hat
three
years
ago
and
has
had
no
hat
since
then
he
has
assuredly
gone
down
in
the
world
“Well
that
is
clear
enough
certainly
but
how
about
the
foresight
and
the
moral
retrogression
sherlock
holmes
laughed
“Here
is
the
foresight
said
he
putting
his
finger
upon
the
little
disc
and
loop
of
the
hat
securer
“They
are
never
sold
upon
hats
if
this
man
ordered
one
it
is
sign
of
certain
amount
of
foresight
since
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
take
this
precaution
against
the
wind
but
since
we
see
that
he
has
broken
the
elastic
and
has
not
troubled
to
replace
it
is
obvious
that
he
has
less
foresight
now
than
formerly
which
is
distinct
proof
of
weakening
nature
on
the
other
hand
he
has
endeavoured
to
conceal
some
of
these
stains
upon
the
felt
by
daubing
them
with
ink
which
is
sign
that
he
has
not
entirely
lost
his
self
respect
“Your
reasoning
is
certainly
plausible
“The
further
points
that
he
is
middle
aged
that
his
hair
is
grizzled
that
it
has
been
recently
cut
and
that
he
uses
lime
cream
are
all
to
be
gathered
from
close
examination
of
the
lower
part
of
the
lining
the
lens
discloses
large
number
of
hair
ends
clean
cut
by
the
scissors
of
the
barber
they
all
appear
to
be
adhesive
and
there
is
distinct
odour
of
lime
cream
this
dust
you
will
observe
is
not
the
gritty
grey
dust
of
the
street
but
the
fluffy
brown
dust
of
the
house
showing
that
it
has
been
hung
up
indoors
most
of
the
time
while
the
marks
of
moisture
upon
the
inside
are
proof
positive
that
the
wearer
perspired
very
freely
and
could
therefore
hardly
be
in
the
best
of
training
“But
his
wife
you
said
that
she
had
ceased
to
love
him
“This
hat
has
not
been
brushed
for
weeks
when
see
you
my
dear
watson
with
week’s
accumulation
of
dust
upon
your
hat
and
when
your
wife
allows
you
to
go
out
in
such
state
shall
fear
that
you
also
have
been
unfortunate
enough
to
lose
your
wife’s
affection
“But
he
might
be
bachelor
“Nay
he
was
bringing
home
the
goose
as
peace
offering
to
his
wife
remember
the
card
upon
the
bird’s
leg
“You
have
an
answer
to
everything
but
how
on
earth
do
you
deduce
that
the
gas
is
not
laid
on
in
his
house
“One
tallow
stain
or
even
two
might
come
by
chance
but
when
see
no
less
than
five
think
that
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
individual
must
be
brought
into
frequent
contact
with
burning
tallow
walks
upstairs
at
night
probably
with
his
hat
in
one
hand
and
guttering
candle
in
the
other
anyhow
he
never
got
tallow
stains
from
gas
jet
are
you
satisfied
“Well
it
is
very
ingenious
said
laughing
“but
since
as
you
said
just
now
there
has
been
no
crime
committed
and
no
harm
done
save
the
loss
of
goose
all
this
seems
to
be
rather
waste
of
energy
sherlock
holmes
had
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
when
the
door
flew
open
and
peterson
the
commissionaire
rushed
into
the
apartment
with
flushed
cheeks
and
the
face
of
man
who
is
dazed
with
astonishment
“The
goose
mr
holmes
the
goose
sir
he
gasped
“Eh
what
of
it
then
has
it
returned
to
life
and
flapped
off
through
the
kitchen
window
holmes
twisted
himself
round
upon
the
sofa
to
get
fairer
view
of
the
man’s
excited
face
“See
here
sir
see
what
my
wife
found
in
its
crop
he
held
out
his
hand
and
displayed
upon
the
centre
of
the
palm
brilliantly
scintillating
blue
stone
rather
smaller
than
bean
in
size
but
of
such
purity
and
radiance
that
it
twinkled
like
an
electric
point
in
the
dark
hollow
of
his
hand
sherlock
holmes
sat
up
with
whistle
“By
jove
peterson
said
he
“this
is
treasure
trove
indeed
suppose
you
know
what
you
have
got
“A
diamond
sir
precious
stone
it
cuts
into
glass
as
though
it
were
putty
“It’s
more
than
precious
stone
it
is
the
precious
stone
“Not
the
countess
of
morcar’s
blue
carbuncle
ejaculated
“Precisely
so
ought
to
know
its
size
and
shape
seeing
that
have
read
the
advertisement
about
it
in
the
times
every
day
lately
it
is
absolutely
unique
and
its
value
can
only
be
conjectured
but
the
reward
offered
of
£1000
is
certainly
not
within
twentieth
part
of
the
market
price
“A
thousand
pounds
great
lord
of
mercy
the
commissionaire
plumped
down
into
chair
and
stared
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
“That
is
the
reward
and
have
reason
to
know
that
there
are
sentimental
considerations
in
the
background
which
would
induce
the
countess
to
part
with
half
her
fortune
if
she
could
but
recover
the
gem
“It
was
lost

“Precisely
so

some

rummaged
amid

that
the

as
it
afterwards
transpired

lying
empty

gave

upon

rushed
into

“Hum

tossing

our

here

with

all
the
other
characteristics
with
which
have
bored
you
so
now
we
must
set
ourselves
very
seriously
to
finding
this

ascertaining
what
part
he
has
played
in
this
little
mystery
to
do
this
we
must
try
the

first

these
lie
undoubtedly
in

by

that
he
thought
of
nothing

bitterly
regretted
the

again
the

by
the
way

to
ask
mrs
hudson
to
examine
its
crop
had
been
delayed
at
case
and
it
was
little
after
half
past
six
when
found
myself
in
baker
street
once
more
as
approached
the
house
saw
tall
man
in
scotch
bonnet
with
coat
which
was
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
waiting
outside
in
the
bright
semicircle
which
was
thrown
from
the
fanlight
just
as
arrived
the
door
was
opened
and
we
were
shown
up
together
to
holmes’
room
“Mr
henry
baker
believe
said
he
rising
from
his
armchair
and
greeting
his
visitor
with
the
easy
air
of
geniality
which
he
could
so
readily
assume
“Pray
take
this
chair
by
the
fire
mr
baker
it
is
cold
night
and
observe
that
your
circulation
is
more
adapted
for
summer
than
for
winter
ah
watson
you
have
just
come
at
the
right
time
is
that
your
hat
mr
baker
“Yes
sir
that
is
undoubtedly
my
hat
he
was
large
man
with
rounded
shoulders
massive
head
and
broad
intelligent
face
sloping
down
to
pointed
beard
of
grizzled
brown
touch
of
red
in
nose
and
cheeks
with
slight
tremor
of
his
extended
hand
recalled
holmes’
surmise
as
to
his
habits
his
rusty
black
frock
coat
was
buttoned
right
up
in
front
with
the
collar
turned
up
and
his
lank
wrists
protruded
from
his
sleeves
without
sign
of
cuff
or
shirt
he
spoke
in
slow
staccato
fashion
choosing
his
words
with
care
and
gave
the
impression
generally
of
man
of
learning
and
letters
who
had
ill
usage
at
the
hands
of
fortune
“We
have
retained
these
things
for
some
days
said
holmes
“because
we
expected
to
see
an
advertisement
from
you
giving
your
address
am
at
loss
to
know
now
why
you
did
not
advertise
our
visitor
gave
rather
shamefaced
laugh
“Shillings
have
not
been
so
plentiful
with
me
as
they
once
were
he
remarked
“I
had
no
doubt
that
the
gang
of
roughs
who
assaulted
me
had
carried
off
both
my
hat
and
the
bird
did
not
care
to
spend
more
money
in
hopeless
attempt
at
recovering
them
“Very
naturally
by
the
way
about
the
bird
we
were
compelled
to
eat
it
“To
eat
it
our
visitor
half
rose
from
his
chair
in
his
excitement
“Yes
it
would
have
been
of
no
use
to
anyone
had
we
not
done
so
but
presume
that
this
other
goose
upon
the
sideboard
which
is
about
the
same
weight
and
perfectly
fresh
will
answer
your
purpose
equally
well
“Oh
certainly
answered
mr
baker
with
sigh
of
relief
“Of
course
we
still
have
the
feathers
legs
crop
and

if
you
wish—”
the
man
burst
into
hearty
laugh
“They
might
be
useful
to
me
as
relics
of
my
adventure
said
he
“but
beyond
that
can
hardly
see
what

my
late
acquaintance

going

with

the
excellent

upon

sharply
across
at
me
with
slight
shrug
of
his
shoulders
“There
is
your

then
and
there
your
bird

he
“By
the
way
would
it
bore
you
to
tell
me

you

the

sir

baker
who
had
risen
and
tucked
his
newly
gained
property
under
his
arm
“There
are
few
of

who
frequent
the

this

our
good
host

goose
club
by

on
consideration
of
some
few
pence
every

we
were
each
to
receive

at

my
pence
were
duly
paid

the

he
bowed
solemnly
to
both
of
us
and
strode
off
upon
his
way
“So
much
for
mr
henry
baker
said
holmes
when
he
had
closed
the
door
behind
him
“It
is
quite
certain
that

nothing

“Then
suggest
that
we
turn
our
dinner
into
supper
and
follow
up
this
clue
while
it
is
still
hot
“By
all
means
it
was
bitter
night
so
we
drew
on
our
ulsters
and
wrapped
cravats
about
our
throats
outside
the
stars
were
shining
coldly
in
cloudless
sky
and
the
breath
of
the
passers
by
blew
out
into
smoke
like
so
many
pistol
shots
our
footfalls
rang
out
crisply
and
loudly
as
we
swung
through
the
doctors’
quarter

street
harley

and
so
through
wigmore
street
into
oxford
street
in
quarter
of
an

we
were
in

corner
of
one
of

streets

runs
down

pushed
open
the
door
of
the
private
bar
and
ordered
two
glasses
of
beer
from
the
ruddy

aproned
landlord

should
be
excellent

seemed
surprised
“Yes
was
speaking
only
half
an

ago
to
mr

who
was

of

“Ah
yes

you

“Well

don’t

your

“Now
for
mr
breckinridge
he
continued
buttoning
up
his
coat
as
we
came
out
into
the
frosty
air
“Remember
watson
that
though
we
have
so
homely
thing
as

at
one
end
of
this
chain
we
have
at
the

will
certainly
get
seven
years’
penal
servitude
unless
we
can
establish
his
innocence
it
is
possible
that
our

may

confirm

guilt

in

we
have

has
been
missed
by

which
singular

so
through

of

of
the

upon
it

the
proprietor
horsey
looking
man
with
sharp
face
and
trim
side

was
helping

to
put
up
the
shutters
“Good
evening
it’s
cold

holmes
the
salesman
nodded
and
shot
questioning
glance
at
my
companion
“Sold
out

continued
holmes
pointing
at
the
bare
slabs
of
marble
“Let
you
have
five

“That’s
no

“Well

him

they
were
too

where
did
you
get
them
from
to
my
surprise
the
question
provoked
burst
of
anger
from
the
salesman
“Now
then
mister
said
he
with
his
head
cocked
and
his
arms
akimbo
“what
are
you
driving
at
let’s
have
it
straight
now
“It
is
straight
enough
should
like
to
know
who
sold
you
the
geese
which
you
supplied
to
the
alpha
“Well
then
shan’t
tell
you
so
now
“Oh
it
is
matter
of
no
importance
but
don’t
know
why
you
should
be
so
warm
over
such
trifle
“Warm
you’d
be
as
warm
maybe
if
you
were
as
pestered
as
am
when
pay
good
money
for
good
article
there
should
be
an
end
of
the
business
but
it’s
‘Where
are
the
geese
and
‘Who
did
you
sell
the
geese
to
and
‘What
will
you
take
for
the

one
would
think
they
were
the
only
geese
in
the
world
to
hear
the
fuss
that
is
made
over
them
“Well
have
no
connection
with
any
other
people
who
have
been
making
inquiries

holmes
carelessly
“If
you
won’t
tell
us
the
bet
is
off
that
is
all
but
i’m
always
ready
to
back
my
opinion
on
matter
of
fowls
and
have
fiver
on
it
that
the
bird
ate
is
country
bred
“Well
then
you’ve
lost
your
fiver
for
it’s
town
bred
snapped
the
salesman
“It’s
nothing
of
the
kind
“I
say
it
is
“I
don’t
believe
it
“D’you
think
you
know
more
about
fowls
than
who
have
handled
them
ever
since
was
nipper
tell
you
all
those
birds
that
went
to
the
alpha
were
town
bred
“You’ll
never
persuade
me
to
believe
that
“Will
you
bet
then
“It’s
merely
taking
your
money
for
know
that
am
right
but
i’ll
have
sovereign
on
with
you
just
to
teach
you
not
to

grimly
“Bring
me

small

the
hanging

“Now
then
mr

the
salesman
“I

looked
deeply
chagrined
he
drew
sovereign
from
his
pocket
and
threw
it
down
upon
the
slab
turning
away
with
the
air
of
man
whose
disgust
is
too
deep
for
words
few
yards
off
he
stopped
under
lamp
post
and
laughed
in
the
hearty
noiseless
fashion
which
was
peculiar
to
him
“When
you
see

cut
and
the
‘Pink

he
“I

not

watson
we
are

nearing
the
end

the
only
point
which
remains
to
be
determined
is
whether
we
should
go
on
to
this
mrs
oakshott
to
night
or
whether
we
should
reserve
it
for
to
morrow
it
is
clear
from
what
that
surly
fellow
said
that
there
are
others
besides
ourselves
who
are
anxious
about
the
matter

his
remarks
were
suddenly
cut
short
by
loud
hubbub
which
broke
out
from
the
stall
which
we
had
just
left
turning
round
we
saw
little
rat
faced
fellow
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
of
yellow
light
which
was
thrown
by
the
swinging
lamp
while
breckinridge
the
salesman
framed
in
the
door
of
his
stall
was
shaking
his
fists
fiercely
at
the
cringing
figure
“I’ve
had
enough
of
you

shouted
“I
wish
you
were
all
at

buy
the

off

the

“Well

ask

for

rushed
fiercely
forward

flitted
away
into

through

scattered

lounged
round
the
flaring

my

speedily
overtook
the

man
and
touched
him
upon
the
shoulder
he
sprang
round
and
could
see
in
the
gas
light
that
every
vestige
of

had
been
driven
from

face

he
stepped
into

in
half
an

we
were
back
in
the
sitting

at

nothing
had
been

but
the
high
thin
breathing
of
our

the
claspings
and

spoke
of

to

clutched

unlocked
his

box

held
up
the
blue
carbuncle

shone
out
like
star
with
cold
brilliant
many
pointed
radiance
ryder
stood
glaring
with
drawn
face
uncertain
whether
to
claim
or
to
disown
it
“The
game’s
up

holmes
quietly
“Hold
up

you’ll

now
he
looks

more

shrimp
it
is
to
be
sure
for
moment
he
had
staggered
and
nearly
fallen
but
the
brandy
brought
tinge
of
colour
into
his
cheeks
and
he
sat
staring
with
frightened
eyes
at
his
accuser
“I
have
almost
every
link
in
my

all
the
proofs
which
could

there
is

you
need
tell

still

too

for

it
has
been
for

you
were
not

you
used

seems
to
me
ryder

there
is
the
making

pretty

you
knew
that
this

been
concerned
in

that
suspicion
would
rest

you
do

you

you
managed
that

should

for

ryder
threw
himself
down
suddenly
upon
the

and
clutched
at
my
companion’s
knees
“For

sternly
“It
is
very
well
to
cringe
and
crawl
now
but
you
thought
little
enough
of
this
poor
horner
in
the
dock
for
crime
of
which
he
knew
nothing
“I
will
fly
mr
holmes
will
leave
the
country
sir
then
the
charge
against
him
will
break
down
“Hum
we
will
talk
about
that
and
now
let
us
hear
true
account
of
the
next
act
how
came
the
stone
into
the
goose
and
how
came
the
goose
into
the
open
market
tell
us
the
truth
for
there
lies
your
only
hope
of
safety
ryder
passed
his
tongue
over
his
parched
lips
“I
will
tell
you
it
just
as
it
happened
sir
said
he
“When
horner
had
been
arrested
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
get
away
with
the
stone
at
once
for
did
not
know
at
what
moment
the
police
might
not
take
it
into
their
heads
to
search
me
and
my
room
there
was
no
place
about
the
hotel
where
it
would
be
safe
went
out
as
if
on
some
commission
and
made
for
my
sister’s
house
she
had
married
man
named
oakshott
and
lived
in
brixton
road
where
she
fattened
fowls
for
the
market
all
the
way
there
every
man
met
seemed
to
me
to
be
policeman
or
detective
and
for
all
that
it
was
cold
night
the
sweat
was
pouring
down
my
face
before
came
to
the
brixton
road
my
sister
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
and
why
was
so
pale
but
told
her
that
had
been
upset
by
the
jewel
robbery
at
the
hotel
then
went
into
the
back
yard
and
smoked
pipe
and
wondered
what
it
would
be
best
to
do
“I
had
friend
once
called
maudsley
who
went
to
the
bad
and
has
just
been
serving
his
time
in
pentonville
one
day
he
had
met
me
and
fell
into
talk
about
the
ways
of
thieves
and
how
they
could
get
rid
of
what
they
stole
knew
that
he
would
be
true
to
me
for
knew
one
or
two
things
about
him
so
made
up
my
mind
to
go
right
on
to
kilburn
where
he
lived
and
take
him
into
my
confidence
he
would
show
me
how
to
turn
the
stone
into
money
but
how
to
get
to
him
in
safety
thought
of
the
agonies
had
gone
through
in
coming
from
the
hotel
might
at
any
moment
be
seized
and
searched
and
there
would
be
the
stone
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
was
leaning
against
the
wall
at
the
time
and
looking
at
the
geese
which
were
waddling
about
round
my
feet
and
suddenly
an
idea
came
into
my
head
which
showed
me
how
could
beat
the
best
detective
that
ever
lived
“My
sister
had
told
me
some
weeks
before
that
might
have
the
pick
of
her
geese
for
christmas
present
and
knew
that
she
was
always
as
good
as
her
word
would
take
my
goose
now
and
in
it
would
carry
my
stone
to
kilburn
there
was
little
shed
in
the
yard
and
behind
this
drove
one
of
the
birds
fine
big
one
white
with
barred
tail
caught
it
and
prying
its
bill
open
thrust
the
stone
down
its
throat
as
far
as
my
finger
could
reach
the
bird
gave
gulp
and
felt
the
stone
pass
along
its
gullet
and
down
into
its
crop
but
the
creature
flapped
and
struggled
and
out
came
my
sister
to
know
what
was
the
matter
as
turned
to
speak
to
her
the
brute
broke
loose
and
fluttered
off
among
the
others
‘Whatever
were
you
doing
with
that
bird
jem
says
she
‘Well
said
‘you
said
you’d
give
me
one
for
christmas
and
was
feeling
which
was
the
fattest
‘Oh
says
she
‘we’ve
set
yours
aside
for
you
jem’s
bird
we
call
it
it’s
the
big
white
one
over
yonder
there’s
twenty
six
of
them
which
makes
one
for
you
and
one
for
us
and
two
dozen
for
the
market
‘Thank
you
maggie
says
‘but
if
it
is
all
the
same
to
you
i’d
rather
have
that
one
was
handling
just
now
‘The
other
is
good
three
pound
heavier
said
she
‘and
we
fattened
it
expressly
for
you
‘Never
mind
i’ll
have
the
other
and
i’ll
take
it
now
said
‘Oh
just
as
you
like
said
she
little
huffed
‘Which
is
it
you
want
then
‘That
white
one
with
the
barred
tail
right
in
the
middle
of
the
flock
‘Oh
very
well
kill
it
and
take
it
with
you
“Well
did
what
she
said
mr
holmes
and
carried
the
bird
all
the
way
to
kilburn
told
my
pal
what
had
done
for
he
was
man
that
it
was
easy
to
tell
thing
like
that
to
he
laughed
until
he
choked
and
we
got
knife
and
opened
the
goose
my
heart
turned
to
water
for
there
was
no
sign
of
the
stone
and
knew
that
some
terrible
mistake
had
occurred
left
the
bird
rushed
back
to
my
sister’s
and
hurried
into
the
back
yard
there
was
not
bird
to
be
seen
there
‘Where
are
they
all
maggie
cried
‘Gone
to
the
dealer’s
jem
‘Which
dealer’s
‘Breckinridge
of
covent
garden
‘But
was
there
another
with
barred
tail
asked
‘the
same
as
the
one
chose
‘Yes
jem
there
were
two
barred
tailed
ones
and
could
never
tell
them
apart
“Well
then
of
course
saw
it
all
and
ran
off
as
hard
as
my
feet
would
carry
me
to
this
man
breckinridge
but
he
had
sold
the
lot
at
once
and
not
one
word
would
he
tell
me
as
to
where
they
had
gone
you
heard
him
yourselves
to
night
well
he
has
always
answered
me
like
that
my
sister
thinks
that
am
going
mad
sometimes
think
that
am
myself
and
now
and
now
am
myself
branded
thief
without
ever
having
touched
the
wealth
for
which
sold
my
character
god
help
me
god
help
me
he
burst
into
convulsive
sobbing
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands

there
was
long
silence
broken
only
by
his
heavy
breathing
and
by
the
measured
tapping
of
sherlock
holmes’
finger
tips
upon
the
edge
of
the
table
then
my
friend
rose
and
threw
open
the
door
“Get
out
said
he
“What
sir
oh
heaven
bless
you
“No
more
words
get
out
and
no
more
words
were
needed
there
was
rush
clatter
upon
the
stairs
the
bang
of
door
and
the
crisp
rattle
of
running
footfalls
from
the
street
“After
all
watson
said
holmes
reaching
up
his
hand
for
his
clay
pipe
“I
am
not
retained
by
the
police
to
supply
their
deficiencies
if
horner
were
in
danger
it
would
be
another
thing
but
this
fellow
will
not
appear
against
him
and
the
case
must
collapse
suppose
that
am
commuting
felony
but
it
is
just
possible
that
am
saving

this
fellow
will
not
go

again
he
is
too
terribly
frightened
send
him
to
gaol
now
and
you
make
him
gaol

for
life
besides
it
is
the
season
of
forgiveness
chance
has
put
in
our
way
most
singular
and
whimsical
problem
and
its
solution
is
its
own
reward
if
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
touch
the
bell
doctor
we
will
begin
another
investigation
in
which
also
bird
will
be
the
chief
feature
viii
the
adventure
of
the
speckled
band
on
glancing
over
my
notes
of
the
seventy
odd
cases
in
which
have
during
the
last
eight
years
studied
the
methods
of
my
friend
sherlock
holmes
find
many
tragic
some
comic
large
number
merely
strange
but
none
commonplace
for
working
as
he
did
rather
for
the
love
of
his
art
than
for
the
acquirement
of
wealth
he
refused
to
associate
himself
with
any
investigation
which
did
not
tend
towards
the
unusual
and
even
the
fantastic
of
all
these
varied
cases
however
cannot
recall
any
which
presented
more
singular
features
than
that
which
was
associated
with
the
well
known
surrey
family
of
the
roylotts
of
stoke
moran
the
events
in
question
occurred
in
the
early
days
of
my
association
with
holmes
when
we
were
sharing
rooms
as
bachelors
in
baker
street
it
is
possible
that
might
have
placed
them
upon
record
before
but
promise
of
secrecy
was
made
at
the
time
from
which
have
only
been
freed
during
the
last
month
by
the
untimely
death
of
the
lady
to
whom
the
pledge
was
given
it
is
perhaps
as
well
that
the
facts
should
now
come
to
light
for
have
reasons
to
know
that
there
are
widespread
rumours
as
to
the
death
of
dr
grimesby
roylott
which
tend
to
make
the
matter
even
more
terrible
than
the
truth
it
was
early
in
april
in
the
year
’83
that
woke
one
morning
to
find
sherlock
holmes
standing
fully
dressed
by
the
side
of
my
bed
he
was
late
riser
as
rule
and
as
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
showed
me
that
it
was
only
quarter
past
seven
blinked
up
at
him
in
some
surprise
and
perhaps
just
little
resentment
for
was
myself
regular
in
my
habits
“Very
sorry
to
knock
you
up
watson
said
he
“but
it’s
the
common
lot
this
morning
mrs
hudson
has
been
knocked
up
she
retorted
upon
me
and
on
you
“What
is
it
then
fire
“No
client
it
seems
that
young
lady
has
arrived
in
considerable
state
of
excitement
who
insists
upon
seeing
me
she
is
waiting
now
in
the
sitting
room
now
when
young
ladies
wander
about
the
metropolis
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
and
knock
sleepy
people
up
out
of
their
beds
presume
that
it
is
something
very
pressing
which
they
have
to
communicate
should
it
prove
to
be
an
interesting
case
you
would
am
sure
wish
to
follow
it
from
the
outset
thought
at
any
rate
that
should
call
you
and
give
you
the
chance
“My
dear
fellow
would
not
miss
it
for
anything
had
no
keener
pleasure
than
in
following
holmes
in
his
professional
investigations
and
in
admiring
the
rapid
deductions
as
swift
as
intuitions
and
yet
always
founded
on
logical
basis
with
which
he
unravelled
the
problems
which
were
submitted
to
him
rapidly
threw
on
my
clothes
and
was
ready
in
few
minutes
to
accompany
my
friend
down
to
the
sitting
room
lady
dressed
in
black
and
heavily
veiled
who
had
been
sitting
in
the
window
rose
as
we
entered
“Good
morning
madam
said
holmes
cheerily
“My
name
is
sherlock
holmes
this
is
my
intimate
friend
and
associate
dr
watson
before
whom
you
can
speak
as
freely
as
before
myself
ha
am
glad
to
see
that
mrs
hudson
has
had
the
good
sense
to
light
the
fire
pray
draw
up
to
it
and
shall
order
you
cup
of
hot
coffee
for
observe
that
you
are
shivering
“It
is
not
cold
which
makes
me
shiver
said
the
woman
in
low
voice
changing
her
seat
as
requested
“What
then
“It
is
fear
mr
holmes
it
is
terror
she
raised
her
veil
as
she
spoke
and
we
could
see
that
she
was
indeed
in
pitiable
state
of
agitation
her
face
all
drawn
and
grey
with
restless
frightened
eyes
like
those
of
some
hunted
animal
her
features
and
figure
were
those
of
woman
of
thirty
but
her
hair
was
shot
with
premature
grey
and
her
expression
was
weary
and
haggard
sherlock
holmes
ran
her
over
with
one
of
his
quick
all
comprehensive
glances
“You
must
not
fear
said
he
soothingly
bending
forward
and
patting
her
forearm
“We
shall
soon
set
matters
right
have
no
doubt
you
have
come
in
by
train
this
morning
see
“You
know
me
then
“No
but
observe
the
second
half
of
return
ticket
in
the
palm
of
your
left
glove
you
must
have
started
early
and
yet
you
had
good
drive
in
dog
cart
along
heavy
roads
before
you
reached
the
station
the
lady
gave
violent
start
and
stared
in
bewilderment
at
my
companion
“There
is
no
mystery
my
dear
madam
said
he
smiling
“The
left
arm
of
your
jacket
is
spattered
with
mud
in
no
less
than
seven
places
the
marks
are
perfectly
fresh
there
is
no
vehicle
save
dog
cart
which
throws
up
mud
in
that
way
and
then
only
when
you
sit
on
the
left
hand
side
of
the
driver
“Whatever
your
reasons
may
be
you
are
perfectly
correct
said
she
“I
started
from
home
before
six
reached
leatherhead
at
twenty
past
and
came
in
by
the
first
train
to
waterloo
sir
can
stand
this
strain
no
longer
shall
go
mad
if
it
continues
have
no
one
to
turn
to
none
save
only
one
who
cares
for
me
and
he
poor
fellow
can
be
of
little
aid
have
heard
of
you
mr
holmes
have
heard
of
you
from
mrs
farintosh
whom
you
helped
in
the
hour
of
her
sore
need
it
was
from
her
that
had
your
address
oh
sir
do
you
not
think
that
you
could
help
me
too
and
at
least
throw
little
light
through
the
dense
darkness
which
surrounds
me
at
present
it
is
out
of
my
power
to
reward
you
for
your
services
but
in
month
or
six
weeks
shall
be
married
with
the
control
of
my
own
income
and
then
at
least
you
shall
not
find
me
ungrateful
holmes
turned
to
his
desk
and
unlocking
it
drew
out
small
case
book
which
he
consulted
“Farintosh
said
he
“Ah
yes
recall
the
case
it
was
concerned
with
an
opal
tiara
think
it
was
before
your
time
watson
can
only
say
madam
that
shall
be
happy
to
devote
the
same
care
to
your
case
as
did
to
that
of
your
friend
as
to
reward
my
profession
is
its
own
reward
but
you
are
at
liberty
to
defray
whatever
expenses
may
be
put
to
at
the
time
which
suits
you
best
and
now
beg
that
you
will
lay
before
us
everything
that
may
help
us
in
forming
an
opinion
upon
the
matter
“Alas
replied
our
visitor
“the
very
horror
of
my
situation
lies
in
the
fact
that
my
fears
are
so
vague
and
my
suspicions
depend
so
entirely
upon
small
points
which
might
seem
trivial
to
another

even
he
to
whom
of
all

right
to
look
for
help
and
advice
looks
upon
all
that
tell
him
about
it
as
the
fancies
of
nervous
woman
he
does
not
say
so
but
can
read
it
from
his
soothing
answers
and
averted
eyes
but
have
heard
mr
holmes
that
you
can
see
deeply
into
the
manifold
wickedness
of
the
human
heart
you
may
advise
me
how
to
walk
amid
the
dangers
which
encompass
me
“I

in
india
he
married
my
mother
mrs
stoner
the
young
widow
of
major
general
stoner
of
the
bengal
artillery
my
sister
julia
and
were
twins
and
we
were
only
two
years
old
at
the
time
of
my
mother’s
re
marriage
she
had
considerable
sum
of
money
not
less
than
£1000
year
and
this
she
bequeathed
to
dr
roylott
entirely
while
we
resided
with
him
with
provision
that
certain
annual
sum
should
be
allowed
to
each
of
us
in
the
event
of
our
marriage
shortly
after
our
return
to
england
my
mother
died
she
was
killed
eight
years
ago
in
railway
accident
near
crewe
dr
roylott
then
abandoned
his
attempts
to
establish
himself
in
practice
in
london
and
took
us
to
live
with
him
in
the
old
ancestral
house
at
stoke
moran
the
money
which
my
mother
had
left
was
enough
for
all
our
wants
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
obstacle
to
our
happiness
“But
terrible
change
came
over
our
stepfather
about
this
time
instead
of
making
friends
and
exchanging
visits
with
our
neighbours
who
had
at
first
been
overjoyed
to
see
roylott
of
stoke
moran
back
in
the
old
family
seat
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
house
and
seldom
came
out
save
to
indulge
in
ferocious
quarrels
with
whoever
might
cross
his
path
violence
of
temper
approaching
to
mania
has
been
hereditary
in
the
men
of
the
family
and
in
my
stepfather’s
case
it
had
believe
been
intensified
by
his
long
residence
in
the
tropics
series
of
disgraceful
brawls
took
place
two
of
which
ended
in
the
police
court
until
at
last
he
became
the
terror
of
the
village
and
the
folks
would
fly
at
his
approach
for
he
is
man
of
immense
strength
and
absolutely
uncontrollable
in
his
anger
“Last
week
he
hurled
the
local
blacksmith
over
parapet
into
stream
and
it
was
only
by
paying
over
all
the
money
which
could
gather
together
that
was
able
to
avert
another
public
exposure
he
had
no
friends
at
all
save
the
wandering
gipsies
and
he
would
give
these
vagabonds
leave
to
encamp
upon
the
few
acres
of
bramble
covered
land
which
represent
the
family
estate
and
would
accept
in
return
the
hospitality
of
their
tents
wandering
away
with
them
sometimes
for
weeks
on
end
he
has
passion
also
for
indian
animals
which
are
sent
over
to
him
by
correspondent
and
he
has
at
this
moment
cheetah
and
baboon
which
wander
freely
over
his
grounds
and
are
feared
by
the
villagers
almost
as
much
as
their
master
“You
can
imagine
from
what
say
that
my
poor
sister
julia
and
had
no
great
pleasure
in
our
lives
no
servant
would
stay
with
us
and
for
long
time
we
did
all
the
work
of
the
house
she
was
but
thirty
at
the
time
of
her
death
and
yet
her
hair
had
already
begun
to
whiten
even
as
mine
has
“Your
sister
is
dead
then
“She
died
just
two
years
ago
and
it
is
of
her
death
that
wish
to
speak
to
you
can
understand
that
living
the
life
which
have
described
we
were
little
likely
to
see
anyone
of
our
own
age
and
position
we
had
however
an
aunt
my
mother’s
maiden
sister
miss
honoria
westphail
who
lives
near
harrow
and
we
were
occasionally
allowed
to
pay
short
visits
at
this
lady’s
house
julia
went
there
at
christmas
two
years
ago
and
met
there
half
pay
major
of
marines
to
whom
she
became
engaged
my
stepfather
learned
of
the
engagement
when
my
sister
returned
and
offered
no
objection
to
the
marriage
but
within
fortnight
of
the
day
which
had
been
fixed
for
the
wedding
the
terrible
event
occurred
which
has
deprived
me
of
my
only
companion
sherlock
holmes
had
been
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
head
sunk
in
cushion
but
he
half
opened
his
lids
now
and
glanced
across
at
his
visitor
“Pray
be
precise
as
to
details
said
he
“It
is
easy
for
me
to
be
so
for
every
event
of
that
dreadful
time
is
seared
into
my
memory
the
manor
house
is
as
have
already
said
very
old
and
only
one
wing
is
now
inhabited
the
bedrooms
in
this
wing
are
on
the
ground
floor
the
sitting
rooms
being
in
the
central
block
of
the
buildings
of
these
bedrooms
the
first
is
dr
roylott’s
the
second
my
sister’s
and
the
third
my
own
there
is
no
communication
between
them
but
they
all
open
out
into
the
same
corridor
do
make
myself
plain
“Perfectly
so
“The
windows
of
the
three
rooms
open
out
upon
the
lawn
that
fatal
night
dr
roylott
had
gone
to
his
room
early
though
we
knew
that
he
had
not
retired
to
rest
for
my
sister
was
troubled
by
the
smell
of
the
strong
indian
cigars
which
it
was
his
custom
to
smoke
she
left
her
room
therefore
and
came
into
mine
where
she
sat
for
some
time
chatting
about
her
approaching
wedding
at
eleven
o’clock
she
rose
to
leave
me
but
she
paused
at
the
door
and
looked
back
‘Tell
me
helen
said
she
‘have
you
ever
heard
anyone
whistle
in
the
dead
of
the
night
‘Never
said
‘I
suppose
that
you
could
not
possibly
whistle
yourself
in
your
sleep
‘Certainly
not
but
why
‘Because
during
the
last
few
nights
have
always
about
three
in
the
morning
heard
low
clear
whistle
am
light
sleeper
and
it
has
awakened
me
cannot
tell
where
it
came
from
perhaps
from
the
next
room
perhaps
from
the
lawn
thought
that
would
just
ask
you
whether
you
had
heard
it
‘No
have
not
it
must
be
those
wretched
gipsies
in
the
plantation
‘Very
likely
and
yet
if
it
were
on
the
lawn
wonder
that
you
did
not
hear
it
also
‘Ah
but
sleep
more
heavily
than
you
‘Well
it
is
of
no
great
consequence
at
any
rate
she
smiled
back
at
me
closed
my
door
and
few
moments
later
heard
her
key
turn
in
the
lock
“Indeed
said
holmes
“Was
it
your
custom
always
to
lock
yourselves
in
at
night
“Always
“And
why
“I
think
that
mentioned
to
you
that
the
doctor
kept
cheetah
and
baboon
we
had
no
feeling
of
security
unless
our
doors
were
locked
“Quite
so
pray
proceed
with
your
statement
“I
could
not
sleep
that
night
vague
feeling
of
impending
misfortune
impressed
me
my
sister
and
you
will
recollect
were
twins
and
you
know
how
subtle
are
the
links
which
bind
two
souls
which
are
so
closely
allied
it
was
wild
night
the
wind
was
howling
outside
and
the
rain
was
beating
and
splashing
against
the
windows
suddenly
amid
all
the
hubbub
of
the
gale
there
burst
forth
the
wild
scream
of
terrified
woman
knew
that
it
was
my
sister’s
voice
sprang
from
my
bed
wrapped
shawl
round
me
and
rushed
into
the
corridor
as
opened
my
door
seemed
to
hear
low
whistle
such
as
my
sister
described
and
few
moments
later
clanging
sound
as
if
mass
of
metal
had
fallen
as
ran
down
the
passage
my
sister’s
door
was
unlocked
and
revolved
slowly
upon
its
hinges
stared
at
it
horror
stricken
not
knowing
what
was
about
to
issue
from
it
by
the
light
of
the
corridor
lamp
saw
my
sister
appear
at
the
opening
her
face
blanched
with
terror
her
hands
groping
for
help
her
whole
figure
swaying
to
and
fro
like
that
of
drunkard
ran
to
her
and
threw
my
arms
round
her
but
at
that
moment
her
knees
seemed
to
give
way
and
she
fell
to
the
ground
she
writhed
as
one
who
is
in
terrible
pain
and
her
limbs
were
dreadfully
convulsed
at
first
thought
that
she
had
not
recognised
me
but
as
bent
over
her
she
suddenly
shrieked
out
in
voice
which
shall
never
forget
‘Oh
my
god
helen
it
was
the
band
the
speckled
band
there
was
something
else
which
she
would
fain
have
said
and
she
stabbed
with
her
finger
into
the
air
in
the
direction
of
the
doctor’s
room
but
fresh
convulsion
seized
her
and
choked
her
words
rushed
out
calling
loudly
for
my
stepfather
and
met
him
hastening
from
his
room
in
his
dressing
gown
when
he
reached
my
sister’s
side
she
was
unconscious
and
though
he
poured
brandy
down
her
throat
and
sent
for
medical
aid
from
the
village
all
efforts
were
in
vain
for
she
slowly
sank
and
died
without
having
recovered
her
consciousness
such
was
the
dreadful
end
of
my
beloved
sister
“One
moment
said
holmes
“are
you
sure
about
this
whistle
and
metallic
sound
could
you
swear
to
it
“That
was
what
the
county
coroner
asked
me
at
the
inquiry
it
is
my
strong
impression
that
heard
it
and
yet
among
the
crash
of
the
gale
and
the
creaking
of
an
old
house
may
possibly
have
been
deceived
“Was
your
sister
dressed
“No
she
was
in
her
night
dress
in
her
right
hand
was
found
the
charred
stump
of
match
and
in
her
left
match
box
“Showing
that
she
had
struck
light
and
looked
about
her
when
the
alarm
took
place
that
is
important
and
what
conclusions
did
the
coroner
come
to
“He
investigated
the
case
with
great
care
for
dr
roylott’s
conduct
had
long
been
notorious
in
the
county
but
he
was
unable
to
find
any
satisfactory
cause
of
death
my
evidence
showed
that
the
door
had
been
fastened
upon
the
inner
side
and
the
windows
were
blocked
by
old
fashioned
shutters
with
broad
iron
bars
which
were
secured
every
night
the
walls
were
carefully
sounded
and
were
shown
to
be
quite
solid
all
round
and
the
flooring
was
also
thoroughly
examined
with
the
same
result
the
chimney
is
wide
but
is
barred
up
by
four
large
staples
it
is
certain
therefore
that
my
sister
was
quite
alone
when
she
met
her
end
besides
there
were
no
marks
of
any
violence
upon
her

about

doctors
examined
her
for
it
but
without
success
“What
do
you
think
that
this
unfortunate
lady
died
of

“It
is
my
belief
that
she
died
of
pure
fear
and
nervous
shock

what
it
was
that
frightened
her

“Two
years
have

my

had
to
move
into

my

very
bed
in
which
she
slept

then
my
thrill
of
terror
when
last
night
as
lay
awake
thinking
over
her
terrible
fate
suddenly
heard
in
the
silence
of
the
night
the
low
whistle

had
been
the
herald
of

own
death

up

what

holmes
pushed
back
the
frill
of
black
lace
which
fringed
the

that
lay
upon

visitor’s
knee
five
little
livid
spots
the
marks

printed
upon

“You
have

cruelly
used

holmes
the

coloured
deeply
and
covered
over
her
injured
wrist
“He
is
hard
man
she
said
“and
perhaps
he
hardly
knows
his

strength
there
was
long
silence
during
which
holmes
leaned
his
chin
upon
his
hands
and
stared
into
the
crackling
fire
“This
is
very
deep

said
at

“There
are

we

it

“As
it
happens
he
spoke
of
coming
into
town
to
day
upon
some
most
important
business
it
is
probable
that
he
will
be
away
all

that
there
would
be
nothing
to
disturb
you
we
have

“By

return
by

twelve
o’clock

coming

you
may
expect
us
early
in
the
afternoon
have
myself
some
small
business
matters
to
attend
to

you
not
wait
and
breakfast
“No
must
go
my
heart
is
lightened
already
since
have
confided
my
trouble
to
you

look
forward
to
seeing
you
again
this
afternoon
she
dropped
her
thick
black
veil
over
her
face

glided
from
the
room
“And
what
do
you
think
of
it
all

asked
sherlock
holmes
leaning
back
in
his
chair
“It
seems
to
me
to
be
most
dark
and
sinister
business
“Dark
enough
and
sinister
enough
“Yet
if
the
lady
is
correct
in
saying
that
the
flooring
and
walls
are
sound
and
that
the
door
window
and
chimney
are
impassable
then
her
sister
must
have
been
undoubtedly
alone
when
she
met
her
mysterious
end
“What
becomes
then
of
these
nocturnal
whistles
and
what
of
the
very
peculiar
words
of
the
dying
woman
“I
cannot
think

you
combine
the
ideas
of
whistles
at
night
the
presence
of
band
of
gipsies
who
are
on
intimate
terms
with
this
old
doctor
the
fact
that
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
doctor
has
an
interest
in
preventing
his
stepdaughter’s
marriage
the
dying
allusion
to

and
finally
the
fact
that
miss
helen
stoner
heard
metallic
clang
which
might
have
been
caused
by
one
of
those
metal
bars
that
secured
the
shutters
falling
back
into
its
place
think
that
there
is
good
ground
to
think
that
the
mystery
may
be
cleared
along
those
lines
“But
what
then
did
the
gipsies
do
“I
cannot
imagine
“I
see
many
objections
to
any
such
theory
“And
so
do
it
is
precisely
for
that
reason
that
we
are
going
to
stoke

this
day

to
see
whether
the
objections
are
fatal

if
they
may
be
explained
away
but
what
in
the
name
of
the
devil
the
ejaculation
had
been
drawn
from
my
companion
by
the
fact
that
our
door
had
been
suddenly
dashed
open
and
that
huge
man
had
framed
himself
in
the
aperture
his
costume
was
peculiar
mixture
of
the
professional
and
of

his

from

to
the
other
of
us
while
his
deep
set
bile
shot
eyes
and
his
high
thin
fleshless
nose
gave
him
somewhat
the
resemblance
to
fierce
old
bird
of
prey
“Which
of
you
is
holmes
asked
this
apparition
“My
name
sir
but
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
said
my
companion
quietly
“I
am

“Indeed
doctor
said
holmes
blandly
“Pray
take
seat
“I
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
my
stepdaughter
has
been
here
have
traced
her
what
has
she
been
saying
to
you
“It
is
little
cold
for
the
time
of
the

said
holmes
“What
has
she
been
saying
to
you
screamed
the
old
man
furiously
“But
have
heard
that
the
crocuses
promise
well
continued
my
companion
imperturbably
“Ha
you
put
me
off
do
you
said
our
new
visitor
taking
step
forward
and
shaking
his
hunting
crop
“I
know
you
scoundrel
have
heard
of
you
before

the
meddler
my

smiled
“Holmes
the
busybody
his
smile
broadened
“Holmes

holmes
chuckled
heartily
“Your
conversation
is
most
entertaining
said
he
“When
you
go
out
close
the
door
for
there
is
decided
draught
“I
will
go

have
said

meddle
with
my
affairs

dangerous

here
he
stepped
swiftly
forward
seized
the
poker
and
bent
it
into
curve
with
his
huge
brown
hands
“See
that
you
keep
yourself
out
of
my
grip
he
snarled
and
hurling
the
twisted
poker
into
the
fireplace
he
strode
out
of
the
room
“He
seems
very
amiable
person
said
holmes
laughing
“I
am
not
quite
so
bulky
but
if
he
had
remained
might
have
shown
him
that
my
grip
was
not
much
more
feeble
than
his
own
as
he
spoke
he
picked
up
the
steel
poker
and
with
sudden
effort
straightened
it
out
again
“Fancy
his
having
the
insolence
to
confound
me
with
the
official

this
incident
gives
zest
to
our
investigation
however
and
only
trust
that
our
little
friend
will
not
suffer
from
her
imprudence
in
allowing
this
brute
to
trace
her

now

we
shall
order
breakfast
and
afterwards
shall
walk
down
to

hope
to
get
some
data
which
may
help
us

o’clock

“I
have
seen
the
will
of
the
deceased
wife
said
he
“To
determine
its
exact
meaning
have
been
obliged
to
work
out
the

it

the
total
income
which
at
the
time
of
the

death
was
little
short
of
£1100
is
now
through

not
more
than
£750
each
daughter

claim
an
income
of
£250
in

it
is
evident
therefore
that
if
both

had
married
this
beauty
would
have
had
mere
pittance

even
one
of
them
would
cripple
him
to
very
serious
extent
my
morning’s
work
has
not
been
wasted
since
it
has
proved
that
he
has
the
very
strongest
motives
for
standing
in
the
way
of
anything
of
the
sort
and
now
watson
this
is
too
serious
for
dawdling
especially
as
the
old
man
is
aware
that
we
are
interesting
ourselves
in
his
affairs
so
if
you
are
ready
we
shall
call
cab
and
drive

be
very
much
obliged

you
would
slip
your

with
gentlemen
who
can
twist

into

that
and
tooth
brush
are
think
all
that
we
need
at
waterloo
we
were
fortunate
in
catching
train
for
leatherhead
where
we
hired
trap
at
the
station
inn
and
drove
for
four
or
five
miles
through
the
lovely
surrey
lanes
it
was
perfect
day
with
bright
sun
and
few
fleecy
clouds
in
the
heavens
the
trees
and
wayside
hedges
were
just
throwing
out
their
first
green
shoots
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
pleasant
smell
of
the
moist
earth
to
me
at
least
there
was
strange
contrast
between
the
sweet
promise
of
the
spring
and
this
sinister
quest
upon
which
we
were
engaged
my
companion
sat
in
the
front
of
the
trap
his
arms
folded
his
hat
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
and
his
chin
sunk
upon
his
breast
buried
in
the
deepest
thought
suddenly
however
he
started
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
and
pointed
over
the
meadows
“Look
there
said
he
heavily
timbered
park
stretched
up
in
gentle
slope
thickening
into
grove
at
the
highest
point
from
amid
the
branches
there
jutted
out
the
grey
gables
and
high
roof
tree
of
very
old
mansion
“Stoke
moran
said
he
“Yes
sir
that
be
the
house
of
dr
grimesby
roylott
remarked
the
driver
“There
is
some
building
going
on
there
said
holmes
“that
is
where
we
are
going
“There’s
the
village
said
the
driver
pointing
to
cluster
of
roofs
some
distance
to
the
left
“but
if
you
want
to
get
to
the
house
you’ll
find
it
shorter
to
get
over
this
stile
and
so
by
the
foot
path
over
the
fields
there
it
is
where
the
lady
is
walking
“And
the
lady
fancy
is
miss
stoner
observed
holmes
shading
his
eyes
“Yes
think
we
had
better
do
as
you
suggest
we
got
off
paid
our
fare
and
the
trap
rattled
back
on
its
way
to
leatherhead
“I
thought
it
as
well
said
holmes
as
we
climbed
the
stile
“that
this
fellow
should
think
we
had
come
here
as
architects
or
on
some
definite
business
it
may
stop
his
gossip
good
afternoon
miss
stoner
you
see
that
we
have
been
as
good
as
our
word
our
client
of
the
morning
had
hurried
forward
to
meet
us
with
face
which
spoke
her
joy
“I
have
been
waiting
so
eagerly
for
you
she
cried
shaking
hands
with
us
warmly
“All
has
turned
out
splendidly
dr
roylott
has
gone
to
town
and
it
is
unlikely
that
he
will
be
back
before
evening
“We
have
had
the
pleasure
of
making
the
doctor’s
acquaintance
said
holmes
and
in
few
words
he
sketched
out
what
had
occurred
miss
stoner
turned
white
to
the
lips
as
she
listened
“Good
heavens
she
cried
“he
has
followed
me
then
“So
it
appears
“He
is
so
cunning
that
never
know
when
am
safe
from
him
what
will
he
say
when
he
returns
“He
must
guard
himself
for
he
may
find
that
there
is
someone
more
cunning
than
himself
upon
his
track
you
must
lock
yourself
up
from
him
to
night
if
he
is
violent
we
shall
take
you
away
to
your
aunt’s
at
harrow
now
we
must
make
the
best
use
of
our
time
so
kindly
take
us
at
once
to
the
rooms
which
we
are
to
examine
the
building
was
of
grey
lichen
blotched
stone
with
high
central
portion
and
two
curving
wings
like
the
claws
of
crab
thrown
out
on
each
side
in
one
of
these
wings
the
windows
were
broken
and
blocked
with
wooden
boards
while
the
roof
was
partly
caved
in
picture
of
ruin
the
central
portion
was
in
little
better
repair
but
the
right
hand
block
was
comparatively
modern
and
the
blinds
in
the
windows
with
the
blue
smoke
curling
up
from
the
chimneys
showed
that
this
was
where
the
family
resided
some
scaffolding
had
been
erected
against
the
end
wall
and
the
stone
work
had
been
broken
into
but
there
were
no
signs
of
any
workmen
at
the
moment
of
our
visit
holmes
walked
slowly
up
and
down
the
ill
trimmed
lawn
and
examined
with
deep
attention
the
outsides
of
the
windows
“This
take
it
belongs
to
the
room
in
which
you
used
to
sleep
the
centre
one
to
your
sister’s
and
the
one
next
to
the
main
building
to
dr
roylott’s
chamber
“Exactly
so
but
am
now
sleeping
in
the
middle
one
“Pending
the
alterations
as
understand
by
the
way
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
very
pressing
need
for
repairs
at
that
end
wall
“There
were
none
believe
that
it
was
an
excuse
to
move
me
from
my
room
“Ah
that
is
suggestive
now
on
the
other
side
of
this
narrow
wing
runs
the
corridor
from
which
these
three
rooms
open
there
are
windows
in
it
of
course
“Yes
but
very
small
ones
too
narrow
for
anyone
to
pass
through
“As
you
both
locked
your
doors
at
night
your
rooms
were
unapproachable
from
that
side
now
would
you
have
the
kindness
to
go
into
your
room
and
bar
your
shutters
miss
stoner
did
so
and
holmes
after
careful
examination
through
the
open
window
endeavoured
in
every
way
to
force
the
shutter
open
but
without
success
there
was
no
slit
through
which
knife
could
be
passed
to
raise
the
bar
then
with
his
lens
he
tested
the
hinges
but
they
were
of
solid
iron
built
firmly
into
the
massive
masonry
“Hum
said
he
scratching
his
chin
in
some
perplexity
“my
theory
certainly
presents
some
difficulties
no
one
could
pass
these
shutters
if
they
were
bolted
well
we
shall
see
if
the
inside
throws
any
light
upon
the
matter
small
side
door
led
into
the
whitewashed
corridor
from
which
the
three
bedrooms
opened
holmes
refused
to
examine
the
third
chamber
so
we
passed
at
once
to
the
second
that
in
which
miss
stoner
was
now
sleeping
and
in
which
her
sister
had
met
with
her
fate
it
was
homely
little
room
with
low
ceiling
and
gaping
fireplace
after
the
fashion
of
old
country
houses
brown
chest
of
drawers
stood
in
one
corner
narrow
white
counterpaned
bed
in
another
and
dressing
table
on
the
left
hand
side
of
the
window
these
articles
with
two
small
wicker
work
chairs
made
up
all
the
furniture
in
the
room
save
for
square
of
wilton
carpet
in
the
centre
the
boards
round
and
the
panelling
of
the
walls
were
of
brown
worm
eaten
oak
so
old
and
discoloured
that
it
may
have
dated
from
the
original
building
of
the
house
holmes
drew
one
of
the
chairs
into
corner
and
sat
silent
while
his
eyes
travelled
round
and
round
and
up
and
down
taking
in
every
detail
of
the
apartment
“Where
does
that
bell
communicate
with
he
asked
at
last
pointing
to
thick
bell
rope
which
hung
down
beside
the
bed
the
tassel
actually
lying
upon
the
pillow
“It
goes
to
the
housekeeper’s
room
“It
looks
newer
than
the
other
things
“Yes
it
was
only
put
there
couple
of
years
ago
“Your
sister
asked
for
it
suppose
“No
never
heard
of
her
using
it
we
used
always
to
get
what
we
wanted
for
ourselves
“Indeed
it
seemed
unnecessary
to
put
so
nice
bell
pull
there
you
will
excuse
me
for
few
minutes
while
satisfy
myself
as
to
this
floor
he
threw
himself
down
upon
his
face
with
his
lens
in
his
hand
and
crawled
swiftly
backward
and
forward
examining
minutely
the
cracks
between
the
boards
then
he
did
the
same
with
the
wood
work
with
which
the
chamber
was
panelled
finally
he
walked
over
to
the
bed
and
spent
some
time
in
staring
at
it
and
in
running
his
eye
up
and
down
the
wall
finally
he
took
the
bell
rope
in
his
hand
and
gave
it
brisk
tug
“Why
it’s
dummy
said
he
“Won’t
it
ring
“No
it
is
not
even
attached
to
wire
this
is
very
interesting
you
can
see
now
that
it
is
fastened
to
hook
just
above
where
the
little
opening
for
the
ventilator
is
“How
very
absurd
never
noticed
that
before
“Very
strange
muttered
holmes
pulling
at
the
rope
“There
are
one
or
two
very
singular
points
about
this
room
for
example
what
fool
builder
must
be
to
open
ventilator
into
another
room
when
with
the
same
trouble
he
might
have
communicated
with
the
outside
air

“That
is
also
quite
modern
said
the
lady
“Done
about
the
same
time
as
the
bell
rope
remarked
holmes
“Yes
there
were
several
little
changes
carried
out
about
that
time
“They
seem
to
have
been
of
most
interesting
character
dummy

ropes
and
ventilators
which
do
not
ventilate
with
your
permission
miss
stoner
we
shall
now
carry
our
researches
into
the
inner
apartment
dr
grimesby
roylott’s
chamber
was
larger
than
that
of
his
step
daughter
but
was
as
plainly
furnished
camp
bed
small
wooden
shelf
full
of
books
mostly
of
technical
character
an
armchair
beside
the
bed
plain
wooden
chair
against
the
wall
round
table
and
large
iron
safe
were
the
principal
things
which
met
the
eye
holmes
walked
slowly
round
and
examined
each
and
all
of
them
with
the
keenest
interest
“What’s
in
here
he
asked
tapping
the
safe
“My
stepfather’s
business
papers
“Oh
you
have
seen
inside
then
“Only
once
some
years
ago
remember
that
it
was
full
of
papers
“There
isn’t
cat
in
it
for
example
“No
what
strange
idea
“Well
look
at
this
he
took
up
small
saucer
of
milk
which
stood
on
the
top
of
it
“No
we
don’t
keep
cat
but
there
is
cheetah
and
baboon
“Ah
yes
of
course
well
cheetah
is
just
big
cat
and
yet
saucer
of
milk
does
not
go
very
far
in
satisfying
its
wants
daresay
there
is
one
point
which
should
wish
to
determine
he
squatted
down
in
front
of
the
wooden
chair
and
examined
the
seat
of
it
with
the
greatest
attention
“Thank
you
that
is
quite
settled
said
he
rising
and
putting
his
lens
in
his
pocket
“Hullo
here
is
something
interesting
the
object
which
had
caught
his
eye
was
small
dog
lash
hung
on
one
corner
of
the
bed
the
lash
however
was
curled
upon
itself
and
tied
so
as
to
make
loop
of
whipcord
“What
do
you
make
of
that
watson
“It’s
common
enough
lash
but
don’t
know
why
it
should
be
tied
“That
is
not
quite
so
common
is
it
ah
me
it’s
wicked
world
and
when
clever
man
turns
his
brains
to
crime
it
is
the
worst
of
all

that
have
seen
enough
now
miss
stoner
and
with
your
permission
we
shall
walk
out
upon
the
lawn
had
never
seen
my
friend’s
face
so
grim
or
his
brow
so
dark
as
it
was
when
we
turned
from
the
scene
of
this
investigation
we
had
walked
several
times
up
and
down
the
lawn
neither
miss
stoner
nor
myself
liking
to
break
in
upon
his
thoughts
before
he
roused
himself
from
his
reverie
“It
is
very
essential
miss
stoner
said
he
“that
you
should
absolutely
follow
my
advice
in
every
respect
“I
shall
most
certainly
do
so
“The
matter
is
too
serious
for
any
hesitation
your
life
may
depend
upon
your
compliance
“I
assure
you
that
am
in
your
hands
“In
the
first
place
both
my
friend
and
must
spend
the
night
in
your
room
both
miss
stoner
and
gazed
at
him
in
astonishment
“Yes
it
must
be
so
let
me
explain
believe
that
is
the
village
inn
over
there
“Yes
that
is
the
crown
“Very
good
your
windows
would
be
visible
from
there
“Certainly
“You
must
confine
yourself
to
your
room
on
pretence
of
headache
when
your
stepfather
comes
back
then
when
you
hear
him
retire
for
the
night
you
must
open
the
shutters

your

no

in

of
the
repairs
you
could
manage
there
for
one
night

yes
easily
“The
rest
you
will
leave
in
our
hands
“But
what
will
you
do
“We
shall
spend
the
night
in
your
room

we
shall
investigate
the
cause
of
this
noise
which
has
disturbed
you

believe
mr

that
you
have
already
made
up
your
mind

“Then
for

sake
tell
me
what
was
the
cause
of
my
sister’s
death

should
prefer
to

clearer
proofs

“You
can
at
least
tell
me
whether
my
own
thought
is
correct

if
she
died
from
some
sudden
fright
“No
do
not

that
there
was
probably
some
more
tangible

now

must
leave

and
had
no
difficulty
in
engaging
bedroom
and
sitting
room
at
the
crown
inn
they
were
on
the
upper
floor
and
from
our
window
we
could
command
view
of
the
avenue
gate
and
of
the
inhabited
wing
of
stoke
moran
manor
house
at
dusk
we
saw
dr

roylott
drive
past
his
huge
form
looming
up
beside
the
little
figure
of
the
lad
who
drove
him
the
boy
had
some
slight
difficulty
in
undoing
the
heavy
iron
gates
and
we
heard
the
hoarse
roar
of
the
doctor’s
voice
and
saw
the
fury
with
which
he
shook
his
clinched
fists
at
him
the
trap
drove
on
and
few
minutes
later
we
saw
sudden
light
spring
up
among
the
trees
as
the
lamp
was
lit
in
one
of
the
sitting
rooms
“Do
you
know
watson
said
holmes
as
we
sat
together
in
the
gathering
darkness
“I
have
really
some
scruples
as
to
taking
you
to
night
there
is
distinct
element
of
danger
“Can
be
of
assistance
“Your
presence
might
be
invaluable
“Then
shall
certainly
come
“It
is
very
kind
of
you
“You
speak
of
danger
you
have
evidently
seen
more
in
these
rooms
than
was
visible
to
me
“No
but
fancy
that
may
have
deduced
little
more
imagine
that
you
saw
all
that
did
“I
saw
nothing
remarkable
save
the
bell
rope
and
what
purpose
that
could
answer
confess
is
more
than
can
imagine
“You
saw
the
ventilator
too
“Yes
but
do
not
think
that
it
is
such
very
unusual
thing
to
have
small
opening
between
two
rooms
it
was
so
small
that
rat
could
hardly
pass
through
“I
knew
that
we
should
find
ventilator
before
ever
we
came
to
stoke
moran
“My
dear
holmes
“Oh
yes
did
you
remember
in
her
statement
she
said
that
her
sister
could
smell
dr
roylott’s
cigar

suggested
at
once
that
there
must
be

between

only

it
would
have
been

inquiry

“But
what
harm
can
there
be
in
that
“Well
there
is
at

curious
coincidence
of
dates

made

is
hung
and
lady
who
sleeps
in
the

not
that
strike
you

cannot
as
yet
see
any

“Did
you
observe
anything
very
peculiar
about
that

“No
“It
was
clamped
to
the
floor
did
you
ever
see

fastened
like
that
before
“I
cannot
say
that

“The
lady

not
move

must
always
be
in
the

relative

to

o’clock

among

trees

extinguished

was
dark
in
the
direction

hours
passed
slowly
away
and
then
suddenly
just
at
the
stroke
of
eleven
single
bright
light
shone
out
right
in

of
us

is

signal

to

we
passed
out

exchanged
few
words
with
the

explaining
that

going
on

acquaintance

that
it
was
possible

out

in

one
yellow
light

in

of
us
through
the

to
guide
us
on

sombre
errand

was
little
difficulty
in
entering

in

reached

lawn

it

were
about
to
enter
through

window

out
from

of
laurel
bushes
there
darted
what
seemed
to
be
hideous
and
distorted
child

threw
itself
upon
the
grass
with
writhing
limbs

“My
god
whispered
“did
you
see
it
holmes
was
for
the
moment
as
startled
as
his
hand
closed
like
vice
upon
my
wrist
in
his
agitation
then
he
broke
into
low
laugh
and
put
his
lips
to
my
ear
“It
is
nice
household
he
murmured
“That
is
the
baboon
had
forgotten
the
strange
pets
which
the
doctor
affected
there
was
cheetah
too
perhaps
we
might
find
it
upon
our
shoulders
at
any
moment
confess
that
felt
easier
in
my
mind
when
after
following
holmes’
example
and
slipping
off
my
shoes
found
myself
inside
the
bedroom
my
companion
noiselessly
closed
the
shutters
moved
the
lamp
onto
the
table
and
cast
his
eyes
round
the
room
all
was
as
we
had
seen
it
in
the
daytime
then
creeping
up
to
me
and
making
trumpet
of
his
hand
he
whispered
into
my
ear
again
so
gently
that
it
was
all
that
could
do
to
distinguish
the
words
“The
least
sound
would
be
fatal
to
our
plans
nodded
to
show
that
had
heard
“We
must
sit
without
light
he
would
see
it
through
the
ventilator
nodded
again
“Do
not
go
asleep
your
very
life
may
depend
upon

your
pistol
ready

we
should
need

sit
on

side
of

and
you
in
that
chair
took
out
my
revolver
and
laid
it
on
the
corner
of
the
table
holmes
had
brought
up
long
thin
cane
and
this
he
placed
upon
the
bed
beside
him
by
it
he
laid
the
box
of
matches
and
the
stump
of
candle
then
he
turned
down
the
lamp
and
we
were
left
in
darkness
how
shall
ever
forget
that
dreadful
vigil
could
not
hear
sound
not
even
the
drawing
of
breath
and
yet
knew
that
my
companion
sat
open
eyed
within
few
feet
of
me
in
the
same
state
of
nervous
tension
in
which
was
myself
the
shutters
cut
off
the
least
ray
of
light
and
we
waited
in
absolute
darkness
from
outside
came
the
occasional
cry
of
night
bird
and
once
at
our
very
window
long
drawn
catlike
whine
which
told
us
that
the
cheetah
was
indeed
at
liberty
far
away
we
could
hear
the
deep
tones
of
the
parish
clock
which
boomed
out
every
quarter
of
an
hour
how
long
they
seemed
those
quarters
twelve
struck
and
one
and
two
and
three
and
still
we
sat
waiting
silently
for
whatever
might
befall
suddenly
there
was
the
momentary
gleam
of
light
up
in
the
direction
of
the
ventilator
which
vanished
immediately
but
was
succeeded
by
strong
smell
of
burning
oil
and
heated
metal
someone
in
the
next
room
had
lit
dark
lantern
heard
gentle
sound
of
movement
and
then
all
was
silent
once
more
though
the
smell
grew
stronger
for
half
an
hour
sat
with
straining
ears
then
suddenly
another
sound
became
audible
very
gentle
soothing
sound
like
that
of
small
jet
of
steam
escaping
continually
from
kettle
the
instant
that
we
heard
it
holmes
sprang
from
the
bed
struck
match
and
lashed
furiously
with
his
cane
at
the
bell
pull
“You
see
it
watson
he
yelled
“You
see
it
but
saw
nothing
at
the
moment
when
holmes
struck
the
light
heard
low
clear
whistle
but
the
sudden
glare
flashing
into
my
weary
eyes
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
tell
what
it
was
at
which
my
friend
lashed
so
savagely
could
however
see
that
his
face
was
deadly
pale
and
filled
with
horror
and
loathing
he
had
ceased
to
strike
and
was
gazing
up
at
the
ventilator
when
suddenly
there
broke
from
the
silence
of
the
night
the
most
horrible
cry
to
which
have
ever
listened
it
swelled
up
louder
and
louder
hoarse
yell
of
pain
and
fear
and
anger
all
mingled
in
the
one
dreadful
shriek
they
say
that
away
down
in
the
village
and
even
in
the
distant
parsonage
that
cry
raised
the
sleepers
from
their
beds
it
struck
cold
to
our
hearts
and
stood
gazing
at
holmes
and
he
at
me
until
the
last
echoes
of
it
had
died
away
into
the
silence
from
which
it
rose
“What
can
it
mean
gasped
“It
means
that
it
is
all
over
holmes
answered
“And
perhaps
after
all
it
is
for
the
best
take
your
pistol
and
we
will
enter
dr
roylott’s
room
with
grave
face
he
lit
the
lamp
and
led
the
way
down
the
corridor
twice
he
struck
at
the
chamber
door
without
any
reply
from
within
then
he
turned
the
handle
and
entered
at
his
heels
with
the
cocked
pistol
in
my
hand
it
was
singular
sight
which
met
our
eyes
on
the
table
stood
dark
lantern
with
the
shutter
half
open
throwing
brilliant
beam
of
light
upon
the
iron
safe
the
door
of
which
was
ajar
beside
this
table
on
the
wooden
chair
sat
dr
grimesby
roylott
clad
in
long
grey
dressing
gown
his
bare
ankles
protruding
beneath
and
his
feet
thrust
into
red
heelless
turkish
slippers
across
his
lap
lay
the
short
stock
with
the
long
lash
which
we
had
noticed
during
the
day
his
chin
was
cocked
upward
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
in
dreadful
rigid
stare
at
the
corner
of
the
ceiling
round
his
brow
he
had
peculiar
yellow
band
with
brownish
speckles
which
seemed
to
be
bound
tightly
round
his
head
as
we
entered
he
made
neither
sound
nor
motion
“The
band
the
speckled
band
whispered
holmes
took
step
forward
in
an
instant
his
strange
headgear
began
to
move
and
there
reared
itself
from
among
his
hair
the
squat
diamond
shaped
head
and
puffed
neck
of
loathsome
serpent
“It
is
swamp
adder
cried
holmes
“the
deadliest
snake
in
india
he
has
died
within
ten
seconds
of
being
bitten
violence
does
in
truth
recoil
upon
the
violent
and
the
schemer
falls
into
the
pit
which
he
digs
for
another
let
us
thrust
this
creature
back
into
its
den
and
we
can
then
remove
miss
stoner
to
some
place
of
shelter
and
let
the
county
police
know
what
has
happened
as
he
spoke
he
drew
the
dog
whip
swiftly
from
the
dead
man’s
lap
and
throwing
the
noose
round
the
reptile’s
neck
he
drew
it
from
its
horrid
perch
and
carrying
it
at
arm’s
length
threw
it
into
the
iron
safe
which
he
closed
upon
it
such
are
the
true
facts
of
the
death
of
dr
grimesby
roylott
of
stoke
moran
it
is
not
necessary
that
should
prolong
narrative
which
has
already
run
to
too
great
length
by
telling
how
we
broke
the
sad
news
to
the
terrified
girl
how
we
conveyed
her
by
the
morning
train
to
the
care
of
her
good
aunt
at
harrow
of
how
the
slow
process
of
official
inquiry
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
doctor
met
his
fate
while
indiscreetly
playing
with
dangerous
pet
the
little
which
had
yet
to
learn
of
the
case
was
told
me
by
sherlock
holmes
as
we
travelled
back
next
day
“I
had
said
he
“come
to
an
entirely
erroneous
conclusion
which
shows
my
dear
watson
how
dangerous
it
always
is
to
reason
from
insufficient
data
the
presence
of
the
gipsies
and
the
use
of
the
word
‘band
which
was
used
by
the
poor
girl
no
doubt
to
explain
the
appearance
which
she
had
caught
hurried
glimpse
of
by
the
light
of
her
match
were
sufficient
to
put
me
upon
an
entirely
wrong
scent
can
only
claim
the
merit
that
instantly
reconsidered
my
position
when
however
it
became
clear
to
me
that
whatever
danger
threatened
an
occupant
of
the
room
could
not
come
either
from
the
window
or
the
door
my
attention
was
speedily
drawn
as
have
already
remarked
to
you
to
this
ventilator
and
to
the
bell
rope
which
hung
down
to
the
bed
the
discovery
that
this
was
dummy
and
that
the
bed
was
clamped
to
the
floor
instantly
gave
rise
to
the
suspicion
that
the
rope
was
there
as
bridge
for
something
passing
through
the
hole
and
coming
to
the
bed
the
idea
of
snake
instantly
occurred
to
me
and
when
coupled
it
with
my
knowledge
that
the
doctor
was
furnished
with
supply
of
creatures
from
india
felt
that
was
probably
on
the
right
track
the
idea
of
using
form
of
poison
which
could
not
possibly
be
discovered
by
any
chemical
test
was
just
such
one
as
would
occur
to
clever
and
ruthless
man
who
had
an
eastern
training
the
rapidity
with
which
such
poison
would
take
effect
would
also
from
his
point
of
view
be
an
advantage
it
would
be
sharp
eyed
coroner
indeed
who
could
distinguish
the
two
little
dark
punctures
which
would
show
where
the
poison
fangs
had
done
their
work
then
thought
of
the
whistle
of
course
he
must
recall
the
snake
before
the
morning
light
revealed
it
to
the
victim
he
had
trained
it
probably
by
the
use
of
the
milk
which
we
saw
to
return
to
him
when
summoned
he
would
put
it
through
this
ventilator
at
the
hour
that
he
thought
best
with
the
certainty
that
it
would
crawl
down
the
rope
and
land
on
the
bed
it
might
or
might
not
bite
the
occupant
perhaps
she
might
escape
every
night
for
week
but
sooner
or
later
she
must
fall
victim
“I
had
come
to
these
conclusions
before
ever
had
entered
his
room
an
inspection
of
his
chair
showed
me
that
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
standing
on
it
which
of
course
would
be
necessary
in
order
that
he
should
reach
the
ventilator
the
sight
of
the
safe
the
saucer
of
milk
and
the
loop
of
whipcord
were
enough
to
finally
dispel
any
doubts
which
may
have
remained
the
metallic
clang
heard
by
miss
stoner
was
obviously
caused
by
her
stepfather
hastily
closing
the
door
of
his
safe
upon
its
terrible
occupant
having
once
made
up
my
mind
you
know
the
steps
which
took
in
order
to
put
the
matter
to
the
proof
heard
the
creature
hiss
as
have
no
doubt
that
you
did
also
and
instantly
lit
the
light
and
attacked
it

of

it
flew
upon
the
first
person
it
saw
in
this
way
am
no
doubt
indirectly
responsible
for
dr
grimesby
roylott’s
death
and
cannot
say
that
it
is
likely
to
weigh
very
heavily
upon
my
conscience
ix
the
adventure
of
the
engineer’s
thumb
of
all
the
problems
which
have
been
submitted
to
my
friend
mr
sherlock
holmes
for
solution
during
the
years
of
our
intimacy
there
were
only
two
which
was
the
means
of
introducing
to
his
notice
that
of
mr
hatherley’s
thumb
and
that
of
colonel
warburton’s
madness
of
these
the
latter
may
have
afforded
finer
field
for
an
acute
and
original
observer
but
the
other
was
so
strange
in
its
inception
and
so
dramatic
in
its
details
that
it
may
be
the
more
worthy
of
being
placed
upon
record
even
if
it
gave
my
friend
fewer
openings
for
those
deductive
methods
of
reasoning
by
which
he
achieved
such
remarkable
results
the
story
has
believe
been
told
more
than
once
in
the
newspapers
but
like
all
such
narratives
its
effect
is
much
less
striking
when
set
forth
en
bloc
in
single
half
column
of
print
than
when
the
facts
slowly
evolve
before
your
own
eyes
and
the
mystery
clears
gradually
away
as
each
new
discovery
furnishes
step
which
leads
on
to
the
complete
truth
at
the
time
the
circumstances
made
deep
impression
upon
me
and
the
lapse
of
two
years
has
hardly
served
to
weaken
the
effect
it
was
in
the
summer
of
’89
not
long
after
my
marriage
that
the
events
occurred
which
am
now
about
to
summarise
had
returned
to
civil
practice
and
had
finally
abandoned
holmes
in
his
baker
street
rooms
although
continually
visited
him
and
occasionally
even
persuaded
him
to
forgo
his
bohemian
habits
so
far
as
to
come
and
visit
us
my
practice
had
steadily
increased
and
as
happened
to
live
at
no
very
great
distance
from
paddington
station
got
few
patients
from
among
the
officials
one
of
these
whom
had
cured
of
painful
and
lingering
disease
was
never
weary
of
advertising
my
virtues
and
of
endeavouring
to
send
me
on
every
sufferer
over
whom
he
might
have
any
influence
one
morning
at
little
before
seven
o’clock
was
awakened
by
the
maid
tapping
at
the
door
to
announce
that
two
men
had
come
from
paddington
and
were
waiting
in
the
consulting
room
dressed
hurriedly
for
knew
by
experience
that
railway
cases
were
seldom
trivial
and
hastened
downstairs
as
descended
my
old
ally
the
guard
came
out
of
the
room
and
closed
the
door
tightly
behind
him
“I’ve
got
him
here
he
whispered
jerking
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
“he’s
all
right
“What
is
it
then
asked
for
his
manner
suggested
that
it
was
some
strange
creature
which
he
had
caged
up
in
my
room
“It’s
new
patient
he
whispered
“I
thought
i’d
bring
him
round
myself
then
he
couldn’t
slip
away
there
he
is
all
safe
and
sound
must
go
now
doctor
have
my
dooties
just
the
same
as
you
and
off
he
went
this
trusty
tout
without
even
giving
me
time
to
thank
him
entered
my
consulting
room
and
found
gentleman
seated
by
the
table
he
was
quietly
dressed
in
suit
of
heather
tweed
with
soft
cloth
cap
which
he
had
laid
down
upon
my
books
round
one
of
his
hands
he
had
handkerchief
wrapped
which
was
mottled
all
over
with
bloodstains
he
was
young
not
more
than
five
and
twenty
should
say
with
strong
masculine
face
but
he
was
exceedingly
pale
and
gave
me
the
impression
of
man
who
was
suffering
from
some
strong
agitation
which
it
took
all
his
strength
of
mind
to
control
“I
am
sorry
to
knock
you
up
so
early
doctor
said
he
“but
have
had
very
serious
accident
during
the
night
came
in
by
train
this
morning
and
on
inquiring
at
paddington
as
to
where
might
find
doctor
worthy
fellow
very
kindly
escorted
me
here
gave
the
maid
card
but
see
that
she
has
left
it
upon
the
side
table
took
it
up
and
glanced
at
it
“Mr
victor
hatherley
hydraulic
engineer
16A
victoria
street
3rd
floor
that
was
the
name
style
and
abode
of
my
morning
visitor
“I
regret
that
have
kept
you
waiting
said
sitting
down
in
my
library
chair
“You
are
fresh
from
night
journey
understand
which
is
in
itself
monotonous
occupation
“Oh
my
night
could
not
be
called
monotonous
said
he
and
laughed
he
laughed
very
heartily
with
high
ringing
note
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
shaking
his
sides
all
my
medical
instincts
rose
up
against
that
laugh
“Stop
it
cried
“pull
yourself
together
and
poured
out
some
water
from
caraffe
it
was
useless
however
he
was
off
in
one
of
those
hysterical
outbursts
which
come
upon
strong
nature
when
some
great
crisis
is
over
and
gone
presently
he
came
to
himself
once
more
very
weary
and
pale
looking
“I
have
been
making
fool
of
myself
he
gasped
“Not
at
all
drink
this
dashed
some
brandy
into
the
water
and
the
colour
began
to
come
back
to
his
bloodless
cheeks
“That’s
better
said
he
“And
now
doctor
perhaps
you
would
kindly
attend
to
my
thumb
or
rather
to
the
place
where
my
thumb
used
to
be
he
unwound
the
handkerchief
and
held
out
his
hand
it
gave
even
my
hardened
nerves
shudder
to
look
at
it
there
were
four
protruding
fingers
and
horrid
red
spongy
surface
where
the
thumb
should
have
been
it
had
been
hacked
or
torn
right
out
from
the
roots
“Good
heavens
cried
“this
is
terrible
injury
it
must
have
bled
considerably
“Yes
it
did
fainted
when
it
was
done
and
think
that
must
have
been
senseless
for
long
time
when
came
to
found
that
it
was
still
bleeding
so
tied
one
end
of
my
handkerchief
very
tightly
round
the
wrist
and
braced
it
up
with
twig
“Excellent
you
should
have
been
surgeon
“It
is
question
of
hydraulics
you
see
and
came
within
my
own
province
“This
has
been
done
said
examining
the
wound
“by
very
heavy
and
sharp
instrument
“A
thing
like
cleaver
said
he
“An
accident
presume
“By
no
means
“What
murderous
attack
“Very
murderous
indeed
“You
horrify
me
sponged
the
wound
cleaned
it
dressed
it
and
finally
covered
it
over
with
cotton
wadding
and
carbolised
bandages
he
lay
back
without
wincing
though
he
bit
his
lip
from
time
to
time
“How
is
that
asked
when
had
finished
“Capital
between
your
brandy
and
your
bandage

new
man
was
very
weak
but
have
had
good
deal
to
go
through
“Perhaps
you
had
better
not
speak
of
the
matter
it
is
evidently
trying
to
your
nerves
“Oh
no
not
now
shall
have
to
tell
my
tale
to
the
police
but
between
ourselves
if
it
were
not
for
the
convincing
evidence
of
this
wound
of
mine
should
be
surprised
if
they
believed
my
statement
for
it
is
very
extraordinary
one
and
have
not
much
in
the
way
of
proof
with
which
to
back
it
up
and
even
if
they
believe
me
the
clues
which
can
give
them
are
so
vague
that
it
is
question
whether
justice
will
be
done
“Ha
cried
“if
it
is
anything
in
the
nature
of
problem
which
you
desire
to
see
solved
should
strongly
recommend
you
to
come
to
my
friend
mr
sherlock
holmes
before
you
go
to
the
official
police
“Oh
have
heard
of
that
fellow
answered
my
visitor
“and
should
be
very
glad
if
he
would
take
the
matter
up
though
of
course
must
use
the
official
police
as
well
would
you
give
me
an
introduction
to
him
“I’ll
do
better
i’ll
take
you
round
to
him
myself
“I
should
be
immensely
obliged
to
you
“We’ll
call
cab
and
go
together
we
shall
just
be
in
time
to
have
little
breakfast
with
him
do
you
feel
equal
to
it
“Yes
shall
not
feel
easy
until
have
told
my
story
“Then
my
servant
will
call
cab
and
shall
be
with
you
in
an
instant
rushed
upstairs
explained
the
matter
shortly
to
my
wife
and
in
five
minutes
was
inside
hansom
driving
with
my
new
acquaintance
to
baker
street
sherlock
holmes
was
as
expected
lounging
about
his
sitting
room
in
his
dressing
gown
reading
the
agony

of

times

smoking
his
before
breakfast
pipe

was
composed

from

all
carefully
dried
and

on

us
in
his
quietly
genial
fashion
ordered
fresh
rashers
and
eggs
and
joined
us
in
hearty
meal
when
it
was
concluded
he
settled
our
new
acquaintance
upon
the
sofa

beneath
his
head

“It
is
easy
to
see
that
your
experience
has
been
no
common
one
mr
hatherley
said
he
“Pray
lie
down
there
and
make
yourself
absolutely
at
home
tell
us
what
you
can
but
stop
when
you
are
tired
and
keep
up
your
strength
with
little
stimulant
“Thank
you
said
my
patient
“but
have
felt
another
man
since
the
doctor
bandaged
me
and
think
that
your
breakfast
has
completed
the
cure
shall
take
up
as
little
of
your
valuable
time
as
possible
so
shall
start
at
once
upon
my
peculiar
experiences
holmes
sat
in
his
big
armchair
with
the
weary
heavy
lidded
expression
which
veiled
his
keen
and
eager
nature
while
sat
opposite
to
him
and
we
listened
in
silence
to
the
strange
story
which
our
visitor
detailed
to
us
“You
must
know
said
he
“that
am
an
orphan
and
bachelor
residing
alone
in
lodgings
in
london
by
profession
am
hydraulic
engineer
and
have
had
considerable
experience
of
my
work
during
the
seven
years
that
was
apprenticed
to
venner
matheson
the
well
known
firm
of
greenwich
two
years
ago
having
served
my
time
and
having
also
come
into
fair
sum
of
money
through
my
poor
father’s
death
determined
to
start
in
business
for
myself
and
took
professional
chambers
in
victoria
street
“I
suppose
that
everyone
finds
his
first
independent
start
in
business
dreary
experience
to
me
it
has
been
exceptionally
so
during
two
years
have
had
three
consultations
and
one
small
job
and
that
is
absolutely
all
that
my
profession
has
brought
me
my
gross
takings
amount
to
£27
10s
every
day
from
nine
in
the
morning
until
four
in
the
afternoon
waited
in
my
little
den
until
at
last
my
heart
began
to
sink
and
came
to
believe
that
should
never
have
any
practice
at
all
“Yesterday
however
just
as
was
thinking
of
leaving
the
office
my
clerk
entered
to
say
there
was
gentleman
waiting
who
wished
to
see
me
upon
business
he
brought
up
card
too
with
the
name
of
‘Colonel
lysander
stark’
engraved
upon
it
close
at
his
heels
came
the
colonel
himself
man
rather
over
the
middle
size
but
of
an
exceeding
thinness
do
not
think
that
have
ever
seen
so
thin
man
his
whole
face
sharpened
away
into
nose
and
chin
and
the
skin
of
his
cheeks
was
drawn
quite
tense
over
his
outstanding
bones
yet
this
emaciation
seemed
to
be
his
natural
habit
and
due
to
no
disease
for
his
eye
was
bright
his
step
brisk
and
his
bearing
assured
he
was
plainly
but
neatly
dressed
and
his
age
should
judge
would
be
nearer
forty
than
thirty
‘Mr
hatherley
said
he
with
something
of
german
accent
‘You
have
been
recommended
to
me
mr
hatherley
as
being
man
who
is
not
only
proficient
in
his
profession
but
is
also
discreet
and
capable
of
preserving
secret
“I
bowed
feeling
as
flattered
as
any
young
man
would
at
such
an
address
‘May
ask
who
it
was
who
gave
me
so
good
character
‘Well
perhaps
it
is
better
that
should
not
tell
you
that
just
at
this
moment
have
it
from
the
same
source
that
you
are
both
an
orphan
and
bachelor
and
are
residing
alone
in
london
‘That
is
quite
correct
answered
‘but
you
will
excuse
me
if
say
that
cannot
see
how
all
this
bears
upon
my
professional
qualifications
understand
that
it
was
on
professional
matter
that
you
wished
to
speak
to
me
‘Undoubtedly
so
but
you
will
find
that
all
say
is
really
to
the
point
have
professional
commission
for
you
but
absolute
secrecy
is
quite
essential
absolute
secrecy
you
understand
and
of
course
we
may
expect
that
more
from
man
who
is
alone
than
from
one
who
lives
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
‘If
promise
to
keep
secret
said
‘you
may
absolutely
depend
upon
my
doing
so
“He
looked
very
hard
at
me
as
spoke
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
had
never
seen
so
suspicious
and
questioning
an
eye
‘Do
you
promise
then
said
he
at
last
‘Yes
promise
‘Absolute
and
complete
silence
before
during
and
after
no
reference
to
the
matter
at
all
either
in
word
or
writing
‘I
have
already
given
you
my
word
‘Very
good
he
suddenly
sprang
up
and
darting
like
lightning
across
the
room
he
flung
open
the
door
the
passage
outside
was
empty
‘That’s
all
right
said
he
coming
back
‘I
know
that
clerks
are
sometimes
curious
as
to
their
master’s
affairs
now
we
can
talk
in
safety
he
drew
up
his
chair
very
close
to
mine
and
began
to
stare
at
me
again
with
the
same
questioning
and
thoughtful
look
“A
feeling
of
repulsion
and
of
something
akin
to
fear
had
begun
to
rise
within
me
at
the
strange
antics
of
this
fleshless
man
even
my
dread
of
losing
client
could
not
restrain
me
from
showing
my
impatience
‘I
beg
that
you
will
state
your
business
sir
said
‘my
time
is
of
value
heaven
forgive
me
for
that
last
sentence
but
the
words
came
to
my
lips
‘How
would
fifty
guineas
for
night’s
work
suit
you
he
asked
‘Most
admirably
‘I
say
night’s
work
but
an
hour’s
would
be
nearer
the
mark
simply
want
your
opinion
about
hydraulic
stamping
machine
which
has
got
out
of
gear
if
you
show
us
what
is
wrong
we
shall
soon
set
it
right
ourselves
what
do
you
think
of
such
commission
as
that
‘The
work
appears
to
be
light
and
the
pay
munificent
‘Precisely
so
we
shall
want
you
to
come
to
night
by
the
last
train
‘Where
to
‘To
eyford
in
berkshire
it
is
little
place
near
the
borders
of
oxfordshire
and
within
seven
miles
of
reading
there
is
train
from
paddington
which
would
bring
you
there
at
about
11
15
‘Very
good
‘I
shall
come
down
in
carriage
to
meet
you
‘There
is
drive
then
‘Yes
our
little
place
is
quite
out
in
the
country
it
is
good
seven
miles
from
eyford
station
‘Then
we
can
hardly
get
there
before
midnight
suppose
there
would
be
no
chance
of
train
back
should
be
compelled
to
stop
the
night
‘Yes
we
could
easily
give
you
shake
down
‘That
is
very
awkward
could
not
come
at
some
more
convenient
hour
‘We
have
judged
it
best
that
you
should
come
late
it
is
to
recompense
you
for
any
inconvenience
that
we
are
paying
to
you
young
and
unknown
man
fee
which
would
buy
an
opinion
from
the
very
heads
of
your
profession
still
of
course
if
you
would
like
to
draw
out
of
the
business
there
is
plenty
of
time
to
do
so
“I
thought
of
the
fifty
guineas
and
of
how
very
useful
they
would
be
to
me
‘Not
at
all
said
‘I
shall
be
very
happy
to
accommodate
myself
to
your
wishes
should
like
however
to
understand
little
more
clearly
what
it
is
that
you
wish
me
to
do
‘Quite
so
it
is
very
natural
that
the
pledge
of
secrecy
which
we
have
exacted
from
you
should
have
aroused
your
curiosity
have
no
wish
to
commit
you
to
anything
without
your
having
it
all
laid
before
you
suppose
that
we
are
absolutely
safe
from
eavesdroppers
‘Entirely
‘Then
the
matter
stands
thus
you
are
probably
aware
that
fuller’s
earth
is
valuable
product
and
that
it
is
only
found
in
one
or
two
places
in
england
‘I
have
heard
so
‘Some
little
time
ago
bought
small
place
very
small
place
within
ten
miles
of
reading
was
fortunate
enough
to
discover
that
there
was
deposit
of
fuller’s
earth
in
one
of
my
fields
on
examining
it
however
found
that
this
deposit
was
comparatively
small
one
and
that
it
formed
link
between
two
very
much
larger
ones
upon
the
right
and
left
both
of
them
however
in
the
grounds
of
my
neighbours
these
good
people
were
absolutely
ignorant
that
their
land
contained
that
which
was
quite
as
valuable
as
gold
mine
naturally
it
was
to
my
interest
to
buy
their
land
before
they
discovered
its
true
value
but
unfortunately
had
no
capital
by
which
could
do
this
took
few
of
my
friends
into
the
secret
however
and
they
suggested
that
we
should
quietly
and
secretly
work
our
own
little
deposit
and
that
in
this
way
we
should
earn
the
money
which
would
enable
us
to
buy
the
neighbouring
fields
this
we
have
now
been
doing
for
some
time
and
in
order
to
help
us
in
our
operations
we
erected
hydraulic
press
this
press
as
have
already
explained
has
got
out
of
order
and
we
wish
your
advice
upon
the
subject
we
guard
our
secret
very
jealously
however
and
if
it
once
became
known
that
we
had
hydraulic
engineers
coming
to
our
little
house
it
would
soon
rouse
inquiry
and
then
if
the
facts
came
out
it
would
be
good
bye
to
any
chance
of
getting
these
fields
and
carrying
out
our
plans
that
is
why
have
made
you
promise
me
that
you
will
not
tell
human
being
that
you
are
going
to
eyford
to
night
hope
that
make
it
all
plain

‘I
quite
follow
you
said
‘The
only
point
which
could
not
quite
understand
was
what
use
you
could
make
of
hydraulic
press
in
excavating
fuller’s
earth
which
as
understand
is
dug
out
like
gravel
from
pit
‘Ah
said
he
carelessly
‘we
have
our
own
process
we
compress
the
earth
into
bricks
so
as
to
remove
them
without
revealing
what
they
are
but
that
is
mere
detail
have
taken
you
fully
into
my
confidence
now
mr
hatherley
and
have
shown
you
how
trust
you

rose
as
he
spoke
‘I
shall
expect
you

eyford
at

‘I
shall
certainly
be
there
‘And
not
word
to
soul
he
looked
at
me
with
last
long
questioning
gaze
and
then
pressing
my
hand
in
cold
dank
grasp
he
hurried
from
the
room
“Well
when
came
to
think
it
all
over
in
cool
blood
was
very
much
astonished
as
you
may
both
think
at
this
sudden
commission
which
had
been
intrusted
to
me
on
the
one
hand
of
course
was
glad
for
the
fee
was
at
least
tenfold
what
should
have
asked
had
set
price
upon
my
own
services
and
it
was
possible
that
this
order
might
lead
to
other
ones
on
the
other
hand
the
face
and
manner
of
my
patron
had
made
an
unpleasant
impression
upon
me
and
could
not
think
that
his
explanation
of
the
fuller’s
earth
was
sufficient
to
explain
the
necessity
for
my
coming
at
midnight
and
his
extreme
anxiety
lest
should
tell
anyone
of
my
errand
however
threw
all
fears
to
the
winds
ate
hearty
supper
drove
to
paddington
and
started
off
having
obeyed
to
the
letter
the
injunction
as
to
holding
my
tongue
“At
reading
had
to
change
not
only
my
carriage
but
my
station
however
was
in
time
for
the
last
train
to
eyford
and
reached
the
little
dim
lit
station
after
eleven
o’clock
was
the
only
passenger
who
got
out
there
and
there
was
no
one
upon
the
platform
save
single
sleepy
porter
with
lantern
as
passed
out
through
the
wicket
gate
however
found
my
acquaintance
of
the
morning
waiting
in
the
shadow
upon
the
other
side
without
word
he
grasped
my
arm
and
hurried
me
into
carriage
the
door
of
which
was
standing
open
he
drew
up
the
windows
on
either
side
tapped
on
the
wood
work
and
away
we
went
as
fast
as
the
horse
could
go
“One
horse
interjected
holmes
“Yes
only
one
“Did
you
observe
the
colour
“Yes
saw
it

the
side
lights
when
was
stepping
into
the
carriage
it
was
chestnut
“Tired
looking
or
fresh
“Oh
fresh
and
glossy
“Thank
you
am
sorry
to
have
interrupted
you
pray
continue
your
most
interesting
statement
“Away
we
went
then
and
we
drove
for
at
least
an
hour
colonel
lysander
stark
had
said
that
it
was
only
seven
miles
but
should
think
from
the
rate
that
we
seemed
to
go
and
from
the
time
that
we
took
that
it
must
have
been
nearer
twelve
he
sat
at
my
side
in
silence
all
the
time
and
was
aware
more
than
once
when
glanced
in
his
direction
that
he
was
looking
at
me
with
great
intensity
the
country
roads
seem
to
be
not
very
good
in
that
part
of
the
world
for
we
lurched
and
jolted
terribly
tried
to
look
out
of
the
windows
to
see
something
of
where
we
were
but
they
were
made
of
frosted
glass
and
could
make
out
nothing
save
the
occasional
bright
blur
of
passing
light
now
and
then
hazarded
some
remark
to
break
the
monotony
of
the
journey
but
the
colonel
answered
only
in
monosyllables
and
the
conversation
soon
flagged
at
last
however
the
bumping
of
the
road
was
exchanged
for
the
crisp
smoothness
of
gravel
drive
and
the
carriage
came
to
stand
colonel
lysander
stark
sprang
out
and
as
followed
after
him
pulled
me
swiftly
into
porch
which
gaped
in
front
of
us
we
stepped
as
it
were
right
out
of
the
carriage
and
into
the
hall
so
that
failed
to
catch
the
most
fleeting
glance
of
the
front
of
the
house
the
instant
that
had
crossed
the
threshold
the
door
slammed
heavily
behind
us
and
heard
faintly
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
as
the
carriage
drove
away
“It
was
pitch
dark
inside
the
house
and
the
colonel
fumbled
about
looking
for
matches
and
muttering
under
his
breath
suddenly
door
opened
at
the
other
end
of
the
passage
and
long
golden
bar
of
light
shot
out
in
our
direction
it
grew
broader
and
woman
appeared
with
lamp
in
her
hand
which
she
held
above
her
head
pushing
her
face
forward
and
peering
at
us
could
see
that
she
was
pretty
and
from
the
gloss
with
which
the
light
shone
upon
her
dark
dress
knew
that
it
was
rich
material
she
spoke
few
words
in
foreign
tongue
in
tone
as
though
asking
question
and
when
my
companion
answered
in
gruff
monosyllable
she
gave
such
start
that
the
lamp
nearly
fell
from
her
hand
colonel
stark
went
up
to
her
whispered
something
in
her
ear
and
then
pushing
her
back
into
the
room
from
whence
she
had
come
he
walked
towards
me
again
with
the
lamp
in
his
hand
‘Perhaps
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
wait
in
this
room
for
few
minutes
said
he
throwing
open
another
door
it
was
quiet
little
plainly
furnished
room
with
round
table
in
the
centre
on
which
several
german
books
were
scattered
colonel
stark
laid
down
the
lamp
on
the
top
of
harmonium
beside
the
door
‘I
shall
not
keep
you
waiting
an
instant
said
he
and
vanished
into
the
darkness
“I
glanced
at
the
books
upon
the
table
and
in
spite
of
my
ignorance
of
german
could
see
that
two
of
them
were
treatises
on
science
the
others
being
volumes
of
poetry
then
walked
across
to
the
window
hoping
that
might
catch
some
glimpse
of
the
country
side
but
an
oak
shutter
heavily
barred
was
folded
across
it
was
wonderfully
silent
house
there
was
an
old
clock
ticking
loudly
somewhere
in
the
passage
but
otherwise
everything
was
deadly
still
vague
feeling
of
uneasiness
began
to
steal
over
me
who
were
these
german
people
and
what
were
they
doing
living
in
this
strange
out
of
the
way
place
and
where
was
the
place
was
ten
miles
or
so
from
eyford
that
was
all
knew
but
whether
north
south
east
or
west
had
no
idea
for
that
matter
reading
and
possibly
other
large
towns
were
within
that
radius
so
the
place
might
not
be
so
secluded
after
all
yet
it
was
quite
certain
from
the
absolute
stillness
that
we
were
in
the
country
paced
up
and
down
the
room
humming
tune
under
my
breath
to
keep
up
my
spirits
and
feeling
that
was
thoroughly
earning
my
fifty
guinea
fee
“Suddenly
without
any
preliminary
sound
in
the
midst
of
the
utter
stillness
the
door
of
my
room
swung
slowly
open
the
woman
was
standing
in
the
aperture
the
darkness
of
the
hall
behind
her
the
yellow
light
from
my
lamp
beating
upon
her
eager
and
beautiful
face
could
see
at
glance
that
she
was
sick
with
fear
and
the
sight
sent
chill
to
my
own
heart
she
held
up
one
shaking
finger
to
warn
me
to
be
silent
and
she
shot
few
whispered
words
of
broken
english
at
me
her
eyes
glancing
back
like
those
of
frightened
horse
into
the
gloom
behind
her
‘I
would
go
said
she
trying
hard
as
it
seemed
to
me
to
speak
calmly
‘I
would
go
should
not
stay
here
there
is
no
good
for
you
to
do
‘But
madam
said
‘I
have
not
yet
done
what
came
for
cannot
possibly
leave
until
have
seen
the
machine
‘It
is
not
worth
your
while
to
wait
she
went
on
‘You
can
pass
through
the
door
no
one
hinders
and
then
seeing
that
smiled
and
shook
my
head
she
suddenly
threw
aside
her
constraint
and
made
step
forward
with
her
hands
wrung
together
‘For
the
love
of
heaven
she
whispered
‘get
away
from
here
before
it
is
too
late
“But
am
somewhat
headstrong
by
nature
and
the
more
ready
to
engage
in
an
affair
when
there
is
some
obstacle
in
the
way
thought
of
my
fifty
guinea
fee
of
my
wearisome
journey
and
of
the
unpleasant
night
which
seemed
to
be
before
me
was
it
all
to
go
for
nothing
why
should
slink
away
without
having
carried
out
my
commission
and
without
the
payment
which
was
my
due
this
woman
might
for
all
knew
be
monomaniac
with
stout
bearing
therefore
though
her
manner
had
shaken
me
more
than
cared
to
confess
still
shook
my
head
and
declared
my
intention
of
remaining
where
was
she
was
about
to
renew
her
entreaties
when
door
slammed
overhead
and
the
sound
of
several
footsteps
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
she
listened
for
an
instant
threw
up
her
hands
with
despairing
gesture
and
vanished
as
suddenly
and
as
noiselessly
as
she
had
come
“The
newcomers
were
colonel
lysander
stark
and
short
thick
man
with
chinchilla
beard
growing
out
of
the
creases
of
his
double
chin
who
was
introduced
to
me
as
mr
ferguson
‘This
is
my
secretary
and
manager
said
the
colonel
‘By
the
way
was
under
the
impression
that
left
this
door
shut
just
now
fear
that
you
have
felt
the
draught
‘On
the
contrary

‘I
opened
the
door
myself

the
room
to
be

“He
shot
one
of
his
suspicious
looks
at
me
‘Perhaps
we
had
better
proceed
to
business
then
said
he
‘Mr
ferguson
and
will
take
you
up
to
see
the
machine
‘I
had
better
put
my
hat
on
suppose
‘Oh
no
it
is
in
the
house
‘What
you
dig
fuller’s
earth
in
the
house
‘No
no
this
is
only
where
we
compress
it
but
never
mind
that
all
we
wish
you
to
do
is
to
examine
the
machine
and
to
let
us
know
what
is
wrong
with
it
“We
went
upstairs
together
the
colonel
first
with
the
lamp
the
fat
manager
and
behind
him
it
was
labyrinth
of
an
old
house
with
corridors
passages
narrow
winding
staircases
and
little
low
doors
the
thresholds
of
which
were
hollowed
out
by
the
generations
who
had
crossed
them
there
were
no
carpets
and
no
signs
of
any
furniture
above
the
ground
floor
while
the
plaster
was
peeling
off
the
walls
and
the
damp
was
breaking
through
in
green
unhealthy
blotches
tried
to
put
on
as
unconcerned
an
air
as
possible
but
had
not
forgotten
the
warnings
of
the
lady
even
though
disregarded
them
and
kept
keen
eye
upon
my
two
companions
ferguson
appeared
to
be
morose
and
silent
man
but
could
see
from
the
little
that
he
said
that
he
was
at
least
fellow
countryman
“Colonel
lysander
stark
stopped
at
last
before
low
door
which
he
unlocked
within
was
small
square
room
in
which
the
three
of
us
could
hardly
get
at
one
time
ferguson
remained
outside
and
the
colonel
ushered
me
in
‘We
are
now
said
he
‘actually
within
the
hydraulic
press
and
it
would
be
particularly
unpleasant
thing
for
us
if
anyone
were
to
turn
it
on
the
ceiling
of
this
small
chamber
is
really
the
end
of
the
descending
piston
and
it
comes
down
with
the
force
of
many
tons
upon
this
metal
floor
there
are
small
lateral
columns
of
water
outside
which
receive
the
force
and
which
transmit
and
multiply
it
in
the
manner
which
is
familiar
to
you
the
machine
goes
readily
enough
but
there
is
some
stiffness
in
the
working
of
it
and
it
has
lost
little
of
its
force
perhaps
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
look
it
over
and
to
show
us
how
we
can
set
it
right
“I
took
the
lamp
from
him
and
examined
the
machine
very
thoroughly
it
was
indeed
gigantic
one
and
capable
of
exercising
enormous
pressure
when
passed
outside
however
and
pressed
down
the
levers
which
controlled
it
knew
at
once
by
the
whishing
sound
that
there
was
slight
leakage
which
allowed
regurgitation
of
water
through
one
of
the
side
cylinders
an
examination
showed
that
one
of
the
india
rubber
bands
which
was
round
the
head
of
driving
rod
had
shrunk
so
as
not
quite
to
fill
the
socket
along
which
it
worked
this
was
clearly
the
cause
of
the
loss
of
power
and
pointed
it
out
to
my
companions
who
followed
my
remarks
very
carefully
and
asked
several
practical
questions
as
to
how
they
should
proceed
to
set
it
right
when
had
made
it
clear
to
them
returned
to
the
main
chamber
of
the
machine
and
took
good
look
at
it
to
satisfy
my
own
curiosity
it
was
obvious
at
glance
that
the
story
of
the
fuller’s
earth
was
the
merest
fabrication
for
it
would
be
absurd
to
suppose
that
so
powerful
an
engine
could
be
designed
for
so
inadequate
purpose
the
walls
were
of
wood
but
the
floor
consisted
of
large
iron
trough
and
when
came
to
examine
it
could
see
crust
of
metallic
deposit
all
over
it
had
stooped
and
was
scraping
at
this
to
see
exactly
what
it
was
when
heard
muttered
exclamation
in
german
and
saw
the
cadaverous
face
of
the
colonel
looking
down
at
me
‘What
are
you
doing
there
he
asked
“I
felt
angry
at
having
been
tricked
by
so
elaborate
story
as
that
which
he
had
told
me
‘I
was
admiring
your
fuller’s
earth
said
‘I
think
that
should
be
better
able
to
advise
you
as
to
your
machine
if
knew
what
the
exact
purpose
was
for
which
it
was
used
“The
instant
that
uttered
the
words
regretted
the
rashness
of
my
speech
his
face
set
hard
and
baleful
light
sprang
up
in
his
grey
eyes
‘Very
well
said
he
‘you
shall
know
all
about
the
machine
he
took
step
backward
slammed
the
little
door
and
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
rushed
towards
it
and
pulled
at
the
handle
but
it
was
quite
secure
and
did
not
give
in
the
least
to
my
kicks
and
shoves
‘Hullo
yelled
‘Hullo
colonel
let
me
out
“And
then
suddenly
in
the
silence
heard
sound
which
sent
my
heart
into
my
mouth
it
was
the
clank
of
the
levers
and
the
swish
of
the
leaking
cylinder
he
had
set
the
engine
at
work
the
lamp
still
stood
upon
the
floor
where
had
placed
it
when
examining
the
trough
by
its
light
saw
that
the
black
ceiling
was
coming
down
upon
me
slowly
jerkily
but
as
none
knew
better
than
myself
with
force
which
must
within
minute
grind
me
to
shapeless
pulp
threw
myself
screaming
against
the
door
and
dragged
with
my
nails
at
the
lock
implored
the
colonel
to
let
me
out
but
the
remorseless
clanking
of
the
levers
drowned
my
cries
the
ceiling
was
only
foot
or
two
above
my
head
and
with
my
hand
upraised
could
feel
its
hard
rough
surface
then
it
flashed
through
my
mind
that
the
pain
of
my
death
would
depend
very
much
upon
the
position
in
which
met
it
if
lay
on
my
face
the
weight
would
come
upon
my
spine
and
shuddered
to
think
of
that
dreadful
snap
easier
the
other
way
perhaps
and
yet
had
the
nerve
to
lie
and
look
up
at
that
deadly
black
shadow
wavering
down
upon
me
already
was
unable
to
stand
erect
when
my
eye
caught
something
which
brought
gush
of
hope
back
to
my
heart
“I
have
said
that
though
the
floor
and
ceiling
were
of
iron
the
walls
were
of
wood
as
gave
last
hurried
glance
around
saw
thin
line
of
yellow
light
between
two
of
the
boards
which
broadened
and
broadened
as
small
panel
was
pushed
backward
for
an
instant
could
hardly
believe
that
here
was
indeed
door
which
led
away
from
death
the
next
instant
threw
myself
through
and
lay
half
fainting
upon
the
other
side
the
panel
had
closed
again
behind
me
but
the
crash
of
the
lamp
and
few
moments
afterwards
the
clang
of
the
two
slabs
of
metal
told
me
how
narrow
had
been
my
escape
“I
was
recalled
to
myself
by
frantic
plucking
at
my
wrist
and
found
myself
lying
upon
the
stone
floor
of
narrow
corridor
while
woman
bent
over
me
and
tugged
at
me
with
her
left
hand
while
she
held
candle
in
her
right
it
was
the
same
good
friend
whose
warning
had
so
foolishly
rejected
‘Come
come
she
cried
breathlessly
‘They
will
be
here
in
moment
they
will
see
that
you
are
not
there
oh
do
not
waste
the
so
precious
time
but
come
“This
time
at
least
did
not
scorn
her
advice
staggered
to
my
feet
and
ran
with
her
along
the
corridor
and
down
winding
stair
the
latter
led
to
another
broad
passage
and
just
as
we
reached
it
we
heard
the
sound
of
running
feet
and
the
shouting
of
two
voices
one
answering
the
other
from
the
floor
on
which
we
were
and
from
the
one
beneath
my
guide
stopped
and
looked
about
her
like
one
who
is
at
her
wit’s
end
then
she
threw
open
door
which
led
into
bedroom
through
the
window
of
which
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
‘It
is
your
only
chance
said
she
‘It
is
high
but
it
may
be
that
you
can
jump
it
“As
she
spoke
light
sprang
into
view
at
the
further
end
of
the
passage
and
saw
the
lean
figure
of
colonel
lysander
stark
rushing
forward
with
lantern
in
one
hand
and
weapon
like
butcher’s
cleaver
in
the
other
rushed
across
the
bedroom
flung
open
the
window
and
looked
out
how
quiet
and
sweet
and
wholesome
the
garden
looked
in
the
moonlight
and
it
could
not
be
more
than
thirty
feet
down
clambered
out
upon
the
sill
but
hesitated
to
jump
until
should
have
heard
what
passed
between
my
saviour
and
the
ruffian
who
pursued
me
if
she
were
ill
used
then
at
any
risks
was
determined
to
go
back
to
her
assistance
the
thought
had
hardly
flashed
through
my
mind
before
he
was
at
the
door
pushing
his
way
past
her
but
she
threw
her
arms
round
him
and
tried
to
hold
him
back
‘Fritz
fritz
she
cried
in
english
‘remember
your
promise
after
the
last
time
you
said
it
should
not
be
again
he
will
be
silent
oh
he
will
be
silent
‘You
are
mad
elise
he
shouted
struggling
to
break
away
from
her
‘You
will
be
the
ruin
of
us
he
has
seen
too
much
let
me
pass
say
he
dashed
her
to
one
side
and
rushing
to
the
window
cut
at
me
with
his
heavy
weapon
had
let
myself
go
and
was
hanging
by
the
hands
to
the
sill
when
his
blow
fell
was
conscious
of
dull
pain
my
grip
loosened
and
fell
into
the
garden
below
“I
was
shaken
but
not
hurt
by
the
fall
so
picked
myself
up
and
rushed
off
among
the
bushes
as
hard
as
could
run
for
understood
that
was
far
from
being
out
of
danger
yet
suddenly
however
as
ran
deadly
dizziness
and
sickness
came
over
me
glanced
down
at
my
hand
which
was
throbbing
painfully
and
then
for
the
first
time
saw
that
my
thumb
had
been
cut
off
and
that
the
blood
was
pouring
from
my
wound
endeavoured
to
tie
my
handkerchief
round
it
but
there
came
sudden
buzzing
in
my
ears
and
next
moment
fell
in
dead
faint
among
the
rose
bushes

“How
long
remained
unconscious
cannot
tell
it
must
have
been
very
long
time
for
the
moon
had
sunk
and
bright
morning
was
breaking
when
came
to
myself
my
clothes
were
all
sodden
with
dew
and
my
coat
sleeve
was
drenched
with
blood
from
my
wounded
thumb
the
smarting
of
it
recalled
in
an
instant
all
the
particulars
of
my
night’s
adventure
and
sprang
to
my
feet
with
the
feeling
that
might
hardly
yet
be
safe
from
my
pursuers
but
to
my
astonishment
when
came
to
look
round
me
neither
house
nor
garden
were
to
be
seen
had
been
lying
in
an
angle
of
the
hedge
close
by
the
highroad
and
just
little
lower
down
was
long
building
which
proved
upon
my
approaching
it
to
be
the
very
station
at
which
had
arrived
upon
the
previous
night
were
it
not
for
the
ugly
wound
upon
my
hand
all
that
had
passed
during
those
dreadful
hours
might
have
been
an
evil
dream
“Half
dazed
went
into
the
station
and
asked
about
the
morning
train
there
would
be
one
to
reading
in
less
than
an
hour
the
same
porter
was
on
duty
found
as
had
been
there
when
arrived
inquired
of
him
whether
he
had
ever
heard
of
colonel
lysander
stark
the
name
was
strange
to
him
had
he
observed
carriage
the
night
before
waiting
for
me
no
he
had
not
was
there
police
station
anywhere
near
there
was
one
about
three
miles
off
“It
was
too
far
for
me
to
go
weak
and
ill
as
was
determined
to
wait
until
got
back
to
town
before
telling
my
story
to
the
police
it
was
little
past
six
when
arrived
so
went
first
to
have
my
wound
dressed
and
then
the
doctor
was
kind
enough
to
bring
me
along
here
put
the
case
into
your
hands
and
shall
do
exactly
what
you
advise
we
both
sat
in
silence
for
some
little
time
after
listening
to
this
extraordinary
narrative
then
sherlock
holmes
pulled
down
from
the
shelf
one
of
the
ponderous
commonplace
books
in
which
he
placed
his
cuttings
“Here
is
an
advertisement
which
will
interest
you
said
he
“It
appeared
in
all
the
papers
about
year
ago
listen
to
this
‘Lost
on
the
9th
inst
mr
jeremiah
hayling
aged
twenty
six
hydraulic

his
lodgings
at
ten
o’clock
at
night
and
has
not
been

of
since
was
dressed

that
represents
the
last
time
that
the
colonel
needed
to
have
his
machine
overhauled
fancy
“Good
heavens
cried
my
patient
“Then
that
explains
what
the
girl
said
“Undoubtedly
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
colonel
was
cool
and
desperate
man
who
was
absolutely
determined
that
nothing
should
stand
in
the
way
of
his
little
game
like
those
out
and
out
pirates
who
will
leave
no
survivor
from
captured
ship
well
every
moment
now
is
precious
so
if
you
feel
equal
to
it
we
shall
go
down
to
scotland
yard
at
once
as
preliminary
to
starting
for
eyford
some
three
hours
or
so
afterwards
we
were
all
in
the
train
together
bound
from
reading
to
the
little
berkshire
village
there
were
sherlock
holmes
the
hydraulic
engineer
inspector
bradstreet
of
scotland
yard
plain
clothes
man
and
myself
bradstreet
had
spread
an
ordnance
map
of
the
county
out
upon
the
seat
and
was
busy
with
his
compasses
drawing
circle
with
eyford
for
its
centre
“There
you
are
said
he
“That
circle
is
drawn
at
radius
of
ten
miles
from
the
village
the
place
we
want
must
be
somewhere
near
that
line
you
said
ten
miles
think
sir
“It
was
an
hour’s
good
drive
“And
you
think
that
they
brought
you
back
all
that
way
when
you
were
unconscious
“They
must
have
done
so
have
confused
memory
too
of
having
been
lifted
and
conveyed
somewhere
“What
cannot
understand
said
“is
why
they
should
have
spared
you
when
they
found
you
lying
fainting
in
the
garden
perhaps
the
villain
was
softened
by
the
woman’s
entreaties
“I
hardly
think
that
likely
never
saw
more
inexorable
face
in
my
life
“Oh
we
shall
soon
clear
up
all
that
said
bradstreet
“Well
have
drawn
my
circle
and
only
wish
knew
at
what
point
upon
it
the
folk
that
we
are
in
search
of
are
to
be
found
“I
think
could
lay
my
finger
on
it
said
holmes
quietly
“Really
now
cried
the
inspector
“you
have
formed
your
opinion
come
now
we
shall
see
who
agrees
with
you
say
it
is
south
for
the
country
is
more
deserted
there
“And
say
east
said
my
patient
“I
am
for
west
remarked
the
plain
clothes
man
“There
are
several
quiet
little
villages
up
there
“And
am
for
north
said
“because
there
are
no
hills
there
and
our
friend
says
that
he
did
not
notice
the
carriage
go
up
any
“Come
cried
the
inspector
laughing
“it’s
very
pretty
diversity
of
opinion
we
have
boxed
the
compass
among
us
who
do
you
give
your
casting
vote
to
“You
are
all
wrong
“But
we
can’t
all
be
“Oh
yes
you
can
this
is
my
point
he
placed
his
finger
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
“This
is
where
we
shall
find
them
“But
the
twelve
mile
drive
gasped
hatherley
“Six
out
and
six
back
nothing
simpler
you
say
yourself
that
the
horse
was
fresh
and
glossy
when
you
got
in
how
could
it
be
that
if
it
had
gone
twelve
miles
over
heavy
roads
“Indeed
it
is
likely
ruse
enough
observed
bradstreet
thoughtfully
“Of
course
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
nature
of
this
gang
“None
at
all
said
holmes
“They
are
coiners
on
large
scale
and
have
used
the
machine
to
form
the
amalgam
which
has
taken
the
place
of
silver
“We
have
known
for
some
time
that
clever
gang
was
at
work
said
the
inspector
“They
have
been
turning
out
half
crowns
by
the
thousand
we
even
traced
them
as
far
as
reading
but
could
get
no
farther
for
they
had
covered
their
traces
in
way
that
showed
that
they
were
very
old
hands
but
now
thanks
to
this
lucky
chance
think
that
we
have
got
them
right
enough
but
the
inspector
was
mistaken
for
those
criminals
were
not
destined
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
justice
as
we
rolled
into
eyford
station
we
saw
gigantic
column
of
smoke
which
streamed
up
from
behind
small
clump
of
trees
in
the
neighbourhood
and
hung
like
an
immense
ostrich
feather
over
the
landscape
“A
house
on
fire
asked
bradstreet
as
the
train
steamed
off
again
on
its
way
“Yes
sir
said
the
station
master
“When
did
it
break
out
“I
hear
that
it
was
during
the
night
sir
but
it
has
got
worse
and
the
whole
place
is
in
blaze
“Whose
house
is
it
“Dr
becher’s
“Tell
me
broke
in
the
engineer
“is
dr
becher
german
very
thin
with
long
sharp
nose
the
station
master
laughed
heartily
“No
sir
dr
becher
is
an
englishman
and
there
isn’t
man
in
the
parish
who
has
better
lined
waistcoat
but
he
has
gentleman
staying
with
him
patient
as
understand
who
is
foreigner
and
he
looks
as
if
little
good
berkshire
beef
would
do
him
no
harm
the
station
master
had
not
finished
his
speech
before
we
were
all
hastening
in
the
direction
of
the
fire
the
road
topped
low
hill
and
there
was
great
widespread
whitewashed
building
in
front
of
us
spouting
fire
at
every
chink
and
window
while
in
the
garden
in
front
three
fire
engines
were
vainly
striving
to
keep
the
flames
under
“That’s
it
cried
hatherley
in
intense
excitement
“There
is
the
gravel
drive
and
there
are
the
rose
bushes
where
lay
that
second
window
is
the
one
that
jumped
from
“Well
at
least
said
holmes
“you
have
had
your
revenge
upon
them
there
can
be
no
question
that
it
was
your
oil
lamp
which
when
it
was
crushed
in
the
press
set
fire
to
the
wooden
walls
though
no
doubt
they
were
too
excited
in
the
chase
after
you
to
observe
it
at
the
time
now
keep
your
eyes
open
in
this
crowd
for
your
friends
of
last
night
though
very
much
fear
that
they
are
good
hundred
miles
off
by
now
and
holmes’
fears
came
to
be
realised
for
from
that
day
to
this
no
word
has
ever
been
heard
either
of
the
beautiful
woman
the
sinister
german
or
the
morose
englishman
early
that
morning
peasant
had
met
cart
containing
several
people
and
some
very
bulky
boxes
driving
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
reading
but
there
all
traces
of
the
fugitives
disappeared
and
even
holmes’
ingenuity
failed
ever
to
discover
the
least
clue
as
to
their
whereabouts
the
firemen
had
been
much
perturbed
at
the
strange
arrangements
which
they
had
found
within
and
still
more
so
by
discovering
newly
severed
human
thumb
upon
window
sill
of
the
second
floor
about
sunset
however
their
efforts
were
at
last
successful
and
they
subdued
the
flames
but
not
before
the
roof
had
fallen
in
and
the
whole
place
been
reduced
to
such
absolute
ruin
that
save
some
twisted
cylinders
and
iron
piping
not
trace
remained
of
the
machinery
which
had
cost
our
unfortunate
acquaintance
so
dearly
large
masses
of
nickel
and
of
tin
were
discovered
stored
in
an
out
house
but
no
coins
were
to
be
found
which
may
have
explained
the
presence
of
those
bulky
boxes

how
our
hydraulic
engineer
had
been
conveyed
from
the
garden
to
the
spot
where
he
recovered
his
senses
might
have
remained
forever
mystery
were
it
not
for
the
soft
mould
which
told
us
very
plain
tale
he
had
evidently
been
carried
down
by
two
persons
one
of
whom
had
remarkably
small
feet
and
the
other
unusually
large
ones
on
the
whole
it
was
most
probable
that
the
silent
englishman
being
less
bold
or
less
murderous
than
his
companion
had
assisted
the
woman
to
bear
the
unconscious
man
out
of
the
way
of
danger
“Well
said
our
engineer
ruefully
as
we
took
our
seats
to
return
once
more
to
london
“it
has
been
pretty
business
for
me
have
lost
my
thumb
and
have
lost
fifty
guinea
fee
and
what
have
gained
“Experience
said
holmes
laughing
“Indirectly
it
may
be
of
value
you
know
you
have
only
to
put
it
into
words
to
gain
the
reputation
of
being
excellent
company
for
the
remainder
of
your
existence
the
adventure
of
the
noble
bachelor
the
lord
st
simon
marriage
and
its
curious
termination
have
long
ceased
to
be
subject
of
interest
in
those
exalted
circles
in
which
the
unfortunate
bridegroom
moves
fresh
scandals
have
eclipsed
it
and
their
more
piquant
details
have
drawn
the
gossips
away
from
this
four
year
old
drama
as
have
reason
to
believe
however
that
the
full
facts
have
never
been
revealed
to
the
general
public
and
as
my
friend
sherlock
holmes
had
considerable
share
in
clearing
the
matter
up
feel
that
no
memoir
of
him
would
be
complete
without
some
little
sketch
of
this
remarkable
episode
it
was
few
weeks
before
my
own
marriage
during
the
days
when
was
still
sharing
rooms
with
holmes
in
baker
street
that
he
came
home
from
an
afternoon
stroll
to
find
letter
on
the
table
waiting
for
him
had
remained
indoors
all
day
for
the
weather
had
taken
sudden
turn
to
rain
with
high
autumnal
winds
and
the
jezail
bullet
which
had
brought
back
in
one
of
my
limbs
as
relic
of
my
afghan
campaign
throbbed
with
dull
persistence
with
my
body
in
one
easy
chair
and
my
legs
upon
another
had
surrounded
myself
with
cloud
of
newspapers
until
at
last
saturated
with
the
news
of
the
day
tossed
them
all
aside
and
lay
listless
watching
the
huge
crest
and
monogram
upon
the
envelope
upon
the
table
and
wondering
lazily
who
my
friend’s
noble
correspondent
could
be
“Here
is
very
fashionable
epistle
remarked
as
he
entered
“Your
morning
letters
if
remember
right
were
from
fish
monger
and
tide
waiter
“Yes
my
correspondence
has
certainly
the
charm
of
variety
he
answered
smiling
“and
the
humbler
are
usually
the
more
interesting
this
looks
like
one
of
those
unwelcome
social
summonses
which
call
upon
man
either
to
be
bored
or
to
lie
he
broke
the
seal
and
glanced
over
the
contents
“Oh
come
it
may
prove
to
be
something
of
interest
after
all
“Not
social
then
“No
distinctly
professional
“And
from
noble
client
“One
of
the
highest

england
“My
dear

congratulate
you
“I
assure
you
watson
without
affectation
that
the
status
of
my

of
less
moment
to

the

of

is
just
possible

to

in
the
corner

the
latter
is
always
instructive

if
you
have
followed
recent

so
closely
you
must
have
read
about

st

his

it

which
has
occurred
in

mr

in

that
he
even
thinks
that
it
might

call

o’clock
in

should
you

lord

himself
for

twenty

proof
against
the
little

arrows
has

definitely
announced
his
approaching

the
fascinating

expectancies
for

it

an
open
secret
that
the
duke

has
been

to
sell
his

few
years
and
as
lord
st

has
no
property

it
is
obvious
that
the
californian

will
enable

to
make

peeress
“Anything
else
asked
holmes
yawning
“Oh
yes
plenty
then
there
is
another
note
in
the
morning
post
to
say
that
the
marriage
would
be
an
absolutely
quiet
one
that
it
would
be
at
st

hanover
square
that
only
half
dozen
intimate

would

invited

that

party
would

has
been
taken
by
mr

two
days
later

there
is

announcement
that
the

had
taken
place

that
the

would
be

are

“Before
the
what
asked
holmes
with
start
“The
vanishing
of
the
lady
“When
did
she
vanish
then
“At
the
wedding
breakfast
“Indeed
this
is
more
interesting
than
it
promised
to
be
quite
dramatic
in
fact
“Yes
it
struck
me
as
being
little
out
of
the
common
“They
often
vanish
before
the
ceremony
and
occasionally
during
the
honeymoon
but
cannot
call
to
mind
anything
quite
so
prompt
as
this
pray
let
me
have
the
details
“I
warn
you
that
they
are
very
incomplete
“Perhaps
we
may
make
them
less
so
“Such
as
they
are
they
are
set
forth
in
single
article
of
morning
paper
of
yesterday
which
will
read
to
you
it
is
headed
‘Singular
occurrence
at
fashionable
wedding’
‘The
family
of
lord
robert
st
simon
has
been
thrown
into
the
greatest
consternation
by
the
strange
and
painful
episodes
which
have
taken
place
in
connection
with
his
wedding
the
ceremony
as
shortly
announced
in
the
papers
of
yesterday
occurred
on
the
previous
morning
but
it
is
only
now
that
it
has
been
possible
to
confirm
the
strange
rumours
which
have
been
so
persistently
floating
about
in
spite
of
the
attempts
of
the
friends
to
hush
the
matter
up
so
much
public
attention
has
now
been
drawn
to
it
that
no
good
purpose
can
be
served
by
affecting
to
disregard
what
is
common
subject
for
conversation
‘The
ceremony
which
was
performed
at
st
george’s
hanover
square
was
very
quiet
one
no
one
being
present
save
the
father
of
the
bride
mr
aloysius

the
duchess
of
balmoral

lord
eustace
and
lady
clara
st
simon
the
younger
brother
and
sister
of
the
bridegroom
and
lady
alicia
whittington
the
whole
party
proceeded
afterwards
to
the
house
of
mr
aloysius
doran
at
lancaster
gate
where
breakfast
had
been
prepared
it
appears
that
some
little
trouble
was
caused
by
woman
whose
name
has
not
been
ascertained
who
endeavoured
to
force
her
way
into
the
house
after
the
bridal
party
alleging
that
she
had
some
claim
upon
lord
st
simon
it
was
only
after
painful
and
prolonged
scene
that
she
was
ejected
by
the
butler
and
the
footman
the
bride
who
had
fortunately
entered
the
house
before
this
unpleasant
interruption
had
sat
down
to
breakfast
with
the
rest
when
she
complained
of
sudden
indisposition
and
retired
to
her
room
her
prolonged
absence
having
caused
some
comment
her
father
followed
her
but
learned
from
her
maid
that
she
had
only
come
up
to
her
chamber
for
an
instant
caught
up
an
ulster
and
bonnet
and
hurried
down
to
the
passage
one
of
the
footmen
declared
that
he
had
seen
lady
leave
the
house
thus
apparelled
but
had
refused
to
credit
that
it
was
his
mistress
believing
her
to
be
with
the
company
on
ascertaining
that
his
daughter
had
disappeared
mr
aloysius
doran
in
conjunction
with
the
bridegroom
instantly
put
themselves
in
communication
with
the
police
and
very
energetic
inquiries
are
being
made
which
will
probably
result
in
speedy
clearing
up
of
this
very
singular
business
up
to
late
hour
last
night
however
nothing
had
transpired
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
missing
lady
there
are
rumours
of
foul
play
in
the
matter
and
it
is
said
that
the
police
have
caused
the
arrest
of
the
woman
who
had
caused
the
original
disturbance
in
the
belief
that
from
jealousy
or
some
other
motive
she
may
have
been
concerned
in
the
strange
disappearance
of
the
bride
“And
is
that
all
“Only
one
little
item
in
another
of
the
morning
papers
but
it
is
suggestive
one
“And
it
is—”
“That
miss
flora
millar
the
lady
who
had
caused
the
disturbance
has
actually
been
arrested
it
appears
that
she
was
formerly
danseuse
at
the
allegro
and
that
she
has
known
the
bridegroom
for
some
years
there
are
no
further
particulars
and
the
whole
case
is
in
your
hands
now
so
far
as
it
has
been
set
forth
in
the
public
press
“And
an
exceedingly
interesting
case
it
appears
to
be

not
have
missed
it
for
worlds
but
there
is

at
the
bell

and
as
the
clock
makes
it
few
minutes
after

no

not
dream

pale

something
perhaps
of
petulance

with
the
steady
well
opened
eye
of
man
whose
pleasant
lot
it
had
ever
been
to
command
and
to
be
obeyed
his
manner
was
brisk
and
yet
his
general
appearance
gave
an
undue
impression
of
age

he
had
slight
forward
stoop
and
little
bend
of
the
knees

he
walked

he

edges
and
thin
upon

slowly

swinging
in

cord

held
his
golden
eyeglasses
“Good

holmes
rising
and
bowing

up

will
talk
this
matter
over
“A
most
painful
matter
to
me
as
you
can
most
readily
imagine
mr

have
been
cut
to
the
quick

you
have

am
descending
“I
beg

suavely

lord
st

glanced
over
it
“Yes
it
is
correct
as
far
as
it
goes
“But
it
needs
great
deal
of
supplementing
before
anyone
could
offer
an
opinion
think
that
may
arrive
at
my
facts
most
directly
by
questioning
you
“Pray
do
so
“When
did
you
first
meet
miss
hatty
doran
“In
san
francisco
year
ago
“You
were
travelling
in
the
states
“Yes
“Did
you
become
engaged
then
“No
“But
you
were
on
friendly
footing
“I
was
amused
by
her
society
and
she
could
see
that
was
amused
“Her
father
is
very
rich
“He
is
said
to
be
the
richest
man
on
the
pacific
slope
“And
how
did
he
make
his
money
“In
mining
he
had
nothing
few
years
ago
then
he
struck
gold
invested
it
and
came
up
by
leaps
and
bounds
“Now
what
is
your
own
impression
as
to
the
young
lady’s
your
wife’s
character
the
nobleman
swung
his
glasses
little
faster
and
stared
down
into
the
fire
“You
see
mr
holmes
said
he
“my
wife
was
twenty
before
her
father
became
rich
man
during
that
time
she
ran
free
in
mining
camp
and
wandered
through
woods
or
mountains
so
that
her
education
has
come
from
nature
rather
than
from
the

she
is
what
we
call

strong
nature

free

not

would
be
repugnant
to
her
“Have
you
her
photograph
“I
brought
this
with
me
he
opened
locket
and
showed
us
the
full
face
of
very
lovely
woman
it
was
not
photograph
but
an
ivory
miniature
and
the
artist
had
brought
out
the
full
effect
of
the
lustrous
black
hair
the
large
dark
eyes
and
the
exquisite
mouth
holmes
gazed
long
and
earnestly
at
it
then
he
closed
the
locket
and
handed
it
back
to
lord
st
simon
“The
young
lady
came
to
london
then
and
you
renewed
your
acquaintance
“Yes
her
father
brought
her
over
for
this
last

season
met
her
several
times
became
engaged
to
her

“She
brought
understand
considerable
dowry
“A
fair
dowry
not
more
than
is
usual
in
my
family
“And
this
of
course
remains
to
you
since
the
marriage
is
fait
accompli
“I
really
have
made
no
inquiries
on
the
subject
“Very
naturally
not
did
you
see
miss
doran
on
the
day
before
the
wedding
“Yes
“Was
she
in
good
spirits
“Never
better
she
kept
talking
of
what
we
should
do
in
our
future
lives
“Indeed
that
is
very
interesting
and
on
the
morning
of
the
wedding
“She
was
as
bright
as
possible
at
least
until
after
the
ceremony
“And
did
you
observe
any
change
in
her
then
“Well
to
tell
the
truth
saw
then
the
first
signs
that
had
ever
seen
that
her
temper
was
just
little
sharp
the
incident
however
was
too
trivial
to
relate
and
can
have
no
possible
bearing
upon
the
case
“Pray
let
us
have
it
for
all
that
“Oh
it
is
childish
she
dropped
her
bouquet
as
we
went
towards
the
vestry
she
was
passing
the
front
pew
at
the
time
and
it
fell
over
into
the
pew
there
was
moment’s
delay
but
the
gentleman
in
the
pew
handed
it
up
to
her
again
and
it
did
not
appear
to
be
the
worse
for
the
fall
yet
when
spoke
to
her
of
the
matter
she
answered
me
abruptly
and
in
the
carriage
on
our
way
home
she
seemed
absurdly
agitated
over
this
trifling
cause
“Indeed
you
say
that
there
was
gentleman
in
the
pew
some
of
the
general
public
were
present
then
“Oh
yes
it
is
impossible
to
exclude
them
when
the
church
is
open
“This
gentleman
was
not
one
of
your
wife’s
friends
“No
no
call
him
gentleman
by
courtesy
but
he
was
quite
common
looking
person
hardly
noticed
his
appearance
but
really
think
that
we
are
wandering
rather
far
from
the
point
“Lady
st
simon
then
returned
from
the
wedding
in
less
cheerful
frame
of
mind
than
she
had
gone
to
it
what
did
she
do
on
re
entering
her
father’s
house
“I
saw
her
in
conversation
with
her
maid
“And
who
is
her
maid
“Alice
is
her
name
she
is
an
american
and
came
from
california
with
her
“A
confidential
servant
“A
little
too
much
so
it
seemed
to
me
that
her
mistress
allowed
her
to
take
great
liberties
still
of
course
in
america
they
look
upon
these
things
in
different
way
“How
long
did
she
speak
to
this
alice
“Oh
few
minutes
had
something
else
to
think
of
“You
did
not
overhear
what
they
said
“Lady
st
simon
said
something
about
‘jumping
claim
she
was
accustomed
to
use
slang
of
the
kind
have
no
idea
what
she
meant
“American
slang
is
very
expressive
sometimes
and
what
did
your
wife
do
when
she
finished
speaking
to
her
maid
“She
walked
into
the
breakfast
room
“On
your
arm
“No
alone
she
was
very
independent
in
little
matters
like
that
then
after
we
had
sat
down
for
ten
minutes
or
so
she
rose
hurriedly
muttered
some
words
of
apology
and
left
the
room
she
never
came
back
“But
this
maid
alice
as
understand
deposes
that
she
went
to
her
room
covered
her
bride’s
dress
with
long
ulster
put
on
bonnet
and
went
out
“Quite
so
and
she
was
afterwards
seen
walking
into
hyde
park
in
company
with
flora
millar
woman
who
is
now
in
custody
and
who
had
already
made
disturbance
at
mr
doran’s
house
that
morning
“Ah
yes
should
like
few
particulars
as
to
this
young
lady
and
your
relations
to
her
lord
st
simon
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
raised
his
eyebrows
“We
have
been
on
friendly
footing
for
some
years
may
say
on
very
friendly
footing
she
used
to
be
at
the
allegro
have
not
treated
her
ungenerously
and
she
had
no
just
cause
of
complaint
against
me
but
you
know
what
women
are
mr
holmes
flora
was
dear
little
thing
but
exceedingly
hot
headed
and
devotedly
attached
to
me
she
wrote
me
dreadful
letters
when
she
heard
that
was
about
to
be
married
and
to
tell
the
truth
the
reason
why
had
the
marriage
celebrated
so
quietly
was
that
feared
lest
there
might
be
scandal
in
the
church
she
came
to
mr
doran’s
door
just
after
we
returned
and
she
endeavoured
to
push
her
way
in
uttering
very
abusive
expressions
towards
my
wife
and
even
threatening
her
but
had
foreseen
the
possibility
of
something
of
the
sort
and
had
two
police
fellows
there
in
private
clothes
who
soon
pushed
her
out
again
she
was
quiet
when
she
saw
that
there
was
no
good
in
making
row
“Did
your
wife
hear
all
this
“No
thank
goodness
she
did
not
“And
she
was
seen
walking
with
this
very
woman
afterwards
“Yes
that
is
what
mr
lestrade
of
scotland
yard
looks
upon
as
so
serious
it
is
thought
that
flora
decoyed
my
wife
out
and
laid
some
terrible
trap
for
her
“Well
it
is
possible
supposition
“You
think
so
too
“I
did
not
say
probable
one
but
you
do
not
yourself
look
upon
this
as
likely
“I
do
not
think
flora
would
hurt
fly
“Still
jealousy
is
strange
transformer
of
characters
pray
what
is
your
own
theory
as
to
what
took
place
“Well
really
came
to
seek
theory
not
to
propound
one
have
given
you
all
the
facts
since
you
ask
me
however
may
say
that
it
has
occurred
to
me
as
possible
that
the
excitement
of
this
affair
the
consciousness
that
she
had
made
so
immense
social
stride
had
the
effect
of
causing
some
little
nervous
disturbance
in
my
wife
“In
short
that
she
had
become
suddenly
deranged
“Well
really
when
consider
that
she
has
turned
her
back
will
not
say
upon
me
but
upon
so
much
that
many
have
aspired
to
without
success
can
hardly
explain
it
in
any
other
fashion
“Well
certainly
that
is
also
conceivable
hypothesis
said
holmes
smiling
“And
now
lord
st
simon
think
that
have
nearly
all
my
data
may
ask
whether
you
were
seated
at
the
breakfast
table
so
that
you
could
see
out
of
the
window
“We
could
see
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
the
park
“Quite
so
then
do
not
think
that
need
to
detain
you
longer
shall
communicate
with
you
“Should
you
be
fortunate
enough
to
solve
this
problem
said
our
client
rising
“I
have
solved
it
“Eh
what
was
that
“I
say
that
have
solved
it
“Where
then
is
my
wife
“That
is
detail
which
shall
speedily
supply
lord
st
simon
shook
his
head
“I
am
afraid
that
it
will
take
wiser
heads
than
yours
or
mine
he
remarked
and
bowing
in
stately
old
fashioned
manner
he
departed
“It
is
very
good
of
lord
st
simon
to
honour
my
head
by
putting
it
on
level
with
his
own
said
sherlock
holmes
laughing
“I
think
that
shall
have
whisky
and
soda
and
cigar
after
all
this
cross
questioning
had
formed
my
conclusions
as
to
the
case
before
our
client
came
into
the
room
“My
dear
holmes
“I
have
notes
of
several
similar
cases
though
none
as
remarked
before
which
were
quite
as
prompt
my
whole
examination
served
to
turn
my
conjecture
into
certainty
circumstantial
evidence
is
occasionally
very
convincing
as
when
you
find
trout
in
the
milk
to
quote
thoreau’s
example
“But
have
heard
all
that
you
have
heard
“Without
however
the
knowledge
of
pre
existing
cases
which
serves
me
so
well
there
was
parallel

in
aberdeen
some
years
back
and
something
on
very
much
the
same
lines
at
munich
the
year
after
the

war
it
is
one
of
these
cases

will
find
an
extra
tumbler
upon
the
sideboard
and
there
are
cigars
in
the
box
the
official
detective
was
attired
in
pea
jacket
and
cravat
which
gave
him
decidedly
nautical
appearance
and
he
carried
black
canvas
bag
in
his
hand
with
short
greeting
he
seated
himself
and
lit
the
cigar
which
had
been
offered
to
him
“What’s
up
then
asked
holmes
with
twinkle
in
his
eye
“You
look
dissatisfied
“And
feel
dissatisfied
it
is
this
infernal
st
simon
marriage
case
can
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
the
business
“Really
you
surprise
me
“Who
ever
heard
of
such
mixed
affair
every
clue
seems
to
slip
through
my
fingers
have
been
at
work
upon
it
all
day
“And
very
wet
it
seems
to
have
made

holmes
laying
his
hand
upon
the
arm
of
the
pea
jacket

have
been
dragging

name
what

search
of
the
body

leaned
back
in

chair

laughed
heartily

“Why
what

in

an
angry
glance
at
my
companion
“I
suppose
you
know
all
about
it
he
snarled
“Well
have
only
just
heard
the
facts
but
my
mind
is
made
up
“Oh
indeed
then
you
think
that
the
serpentine
plays
no
part
in
the
matter
“I
think
it
very
unlikely
“Then
perhaps
you
will
kindly
explain
how
it
is
that
we
found
this
in
it
he
opened
his
bag
as
he
spoke
and
tumbled
onto
the
floor
wedding
dress
of
watered
silk
pair
of
white
satin
shoes
and
bride’s
wreath
and
veil
all
discoloured
and
soaked
in
water
“There

he
putting
new
wedding
ring
upon
the
top
of
the
pile
“There
is
little
nut
for
you
to
crack
master
holmes
“Oh
indeed
said
my
friend
blowing
blue
rings
into
the
air
“You
dragged
them
from
the
serpentine
“No
they
were
found
floating
near
the
margin
by
park
keeper
they
have
been
identified
as
her
clothes
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
the
clothes
were
there
the
body
would
not
be
far
off
“By
the
same
brilliant
reasoning
every
man’s
body
is
to
be
found
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
wardrobe
and
pray
what
did
you
hope
to
arrive
at
through
this
“At
some
evidence
implicating
flora
millar
in
the
disappearance
“I
am
afraid
that
you
will
find
it
difficult
“Are
you
indeed
now
cried
lestrade
with
some
bitterness
“I
am
afraid
holmes
that
you
are
not
very
practical
with
your
deductions
and
your
inferences
you
have
made
two
blunders
in
as
many
minutes
this

does
implicate
miss
flora

“And
how
“In

here
is
the
very
note

slapped
it
down
upon
the
table
in

of
him
“Listen
to
this
‘You
will
see
me
when
all
is
ready
come
at

now
my
theory
all
along
has
been
that
lady
st
simon
was
decoyed
away
by
flora
millar
and
that
she
with
confederates
no
doubt
was
responsible
for
her
disappearance
here
signed
with
her
initials
is
the
very
note
which
was
no
doubt
quietly
slipped
into
her
hand
at
the
door
and
which
lured
her
within
their
reach
“Very
good

holmes
laughing
“You
really
are
very
fine
indeed
let
me
see
it
he
took
up
the
paper
in
listless
way
but
his
attention
instantly
became
riveted
and
he
gave
little
cry
of
satisfaction
“This
is
indeed
important
said
he
“Ha
you
find
it
so
“Extremely
so
congratulate
you
warmly
lestrade
rose
in
his
triumph
and
bent
his
head
to
look
“Why
he
shrieked
“you’re
looking
at
the
wrong
side
“On
the
contrary
this
is
the
right
side

right
side
you’re
mad

in

over
here

over

gathered
up
the
garments
thrust
them
into
the
bag
and
made
for
the
door
“Just

you

before
his
rival
vanished
“I
will
tell
you
the

looked
sadly
at
my
companion
then
he
turned
to
me
tapped
his
forehead
three
times
shook
his
head
solemnly
and
hurried
away
he
had
hardly
shut
the
door
behind
him
when
holmes
rose
to
put
on
his
overcoat
“There
is
something
in
what
the
fellow
says
about
outdoor
work
he
remarked
“so
think
watson
that
must
leave
you
to
your

for
little
it
was
after
five
o’clock
when
sherlock
holmes
left
me
but
had
no
time
to
be
lonely
for
within
an
hour
there
arrived
confectioner’s
man
with
very
large
flat
box
this
he
unpacked
with
the
help
of
youth
whom
he
had
brought
with
him
and
presently
to
my
very
great
astonishment
quite
epicurean
little
cold
supper
began
to
be
laid
out
upon
our
humble
lodging
house
mahogany
there
were
couple
of
brace
of
cold
woodcock
pheasant
pâté
de
foie
gras
pie
with
group
of
ancient
and
cobwebby
bottles
having
laid
out
all
these
luxuries
my
two
visitors
vanished
away
like
the
genii
of
the
arabian
nights
with
no
explanation
save
that
the
things
had
been
paid
for
and
were
ordered
to
this
address
just
before
nine
o’clock
sherlock
holmes
stepped
briskly
into
the
room
his
features
were
gravely
set
but
there
was
light
in
his
eye
which
made
me
think
that
he
had
not
been
disappointed
in
his
conclusions
“They
have
laid
the
supper
then
he
said
rubbing
his
hands
“You
seem
to
expect
company
they
have
laid
for
five
“Yes
fancy
we
may
have
some
company
dropping
in
said
he
“I
am
surprised
that
lord
st
simon
has
not
already
arrived
ha
fancy
that
hear
his
step
now
upon
the
stairs
it
was
indeed
our
visitor
of
the
afternoon
who
came
bustling
in
dangling
his
glasses
more
vigorously
than
ever
and
with
very
perturbed
expression
upon
his
aristocratic
features
“My
messenger
reached
you
then
asked
holmes
“Yes
and
confess
that
the
contents
startled
me
beyond
measure
have
you
good
authority
for
what
you
say
“The
best
possible
lord
st
simon
sank
into
chair
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
“What
will
the
duke
say
he
murmured
“when
he
hears
that
one
of
the
family
has
been
subjected
to
such
humiliation
“It
is
the
purest
accident
cannot
allow
that
there
is
any
humiliation
“Ah
you
look
on
these
things
from
another
standpoint
“I
fail
to
see
that
anyone
is
to
blame
can
hardly
see
how
the
lady
could
have
acted
otherwise
though
her
abrupt
method
of
doing
it
was
undoubtedly
to
be
regretted
having
no
mother
she
had
no
one
to
advise
her
at
such
crisis
“It
was
slight
sir
public
slight
said
lord
st
simon
tapping
his
fingers
upon
the
table
“You
must
make
allowance
for
this
poor
girl
placed
in
so
unprecedented
position
“I
will
make
no
allowance
am
very
angry
indeed
and
have
been
shamefully
used
“I
think
that
heard
ring
said
holmes
“Yes
there
are
steps
on
the
landing
if
cannot
persuade
you
to
take
lenient
view
of
the
matter
lord
st
simon
have
brought
an
advocate
here
who
may
be
more
successful
he
opened
the
door
and
ushered
in
lady
and
gentleman
“Lord
st
simon
said
he
“allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
mr
and
mrs
francis
hay
moulton
the
lady
think
you
have
already
met
at
the
sight
of
these
newcomers
our
client
had
sprung
from
his
seat
and
stood
very
erect
with
his
eyes
cast
down
and
his
hand
thrust
into
the
breast
of
his
frock
coat
picture
of
offended
dignity
the
lady
had
taken
quick
step
forward
and
had
held
out
her
hand
to
him
but
he
still
refused
to
raise
his
eyes
it
was
as
well
for
his
resolution
perhaps
for
her
pleading
face
was
one
which
it
was
hard
to
resist
“You’re
angry
robert
said
she
“Well
guess
you
have
every
cause
to
be
“Pray
make
no
apology
to
me
said
lord
st
simon
bitterly
“Oh
yes
know
that
have
treated
you
real
bad
and
that
should
have
spoken
to
you
before
went
but
was
kind
of
rattled
and
from
the
time
when
saw
frank
here
again
just
didn’t
know
what
was
doing
or
saying
only
wonder
didn’t
fall
down
and
do
faint
right
there
before
the
altar
“Perhaps
mrs
moulton
you
would
like
my
friend
and
me
to
leave
the
room
while
you
explain
this
matter
“If
may
give
an
opinion
remarked
the
strange
gentleman
“we’ve
had
just
little
too
much
secrecy
over
this
business
already
for
my
part
should
like
all
europe
and
america
to
hear
the
rights
of
it
he
was
small
wiry
sunburnt
man
clean
shaven
with
sharp
face
and
alert
manner
“Then
i’ll
tell
our
story
right
away
said
the
lady
“Frank
here
and
met
in
’84
in
mcQuire’s
camp
near
the
rockies
where
pa
was
working
claim
we
were
engaged
to
each
other
frank
and
but
then
one
day
father
struck
rich
pocket
and
made
pile
while
poor
frank
here
had
claim
that
petered
out
and
came
to
nothing
the
richer
pa
grew
the
poorer
was
frank
so
at
last
pa
wouldn’t
hear
of
our
engagement
lasting
any
longer
and
he
took
me
away
to
’Frisco
frank
wouldn’t
throw
up
his
hand
though
so
he
followed
me
there
and
he
saw
me
without
pa
knowing
anything
about
it
would
only
have
made
him
mad
to
know
so
we
just
fixed
it
all
up
for
ourselves
frank
said
that
he
would
go
and
make
his
pile
too
and
never
come
back
to
claim
me
until
he
had
as
much
as
pa
so
then
promised
to
wait
for
him
to
the
end
of
time
and
pledged
myself
not
to
marry
anyone
else
while
he
lived
‘Why
shouldn’t
we
be
married
right
away
then
said
he
‘and
then
will
feel
sure
of
you
and
won’t
claim
to
be
your
husband
until
come
back
well
we
talked
it
over
and
he
had
fixed
it
all
up
so
nicely
with
clergyman
all
ready
in
waiting
that
we
just
did
it
right
there
and
then
frank
went
off
to
seek
his
fortune
and
went
back
to
pa

“The
next
heard
of
frank
was
that
he
was
in
montana
and
then
he
went
prospecting
in
arizona
and
then
heard
of
him
from
new
mexico
after
that
came
long
newspaper
story
about
how
miners’
camp
had
been
attacked
by
apache
indians
and
there
was
my
frank’s
name
among
the
killed
fainted
dead
away
and
was
very
sick
for
months
after
pa
thought
had
decline
and
took
me
to
half
the
doctors
in
’Frisco
not
word
of
news
came
for
year
and
more
so
that
never
doubted
that
frank
was
really
dead
then
lord
st
simon
came
to
’Frisco
and
we
came
to
london
and
marriage
was
arranged
and
pa
was
very
pleased
but
felt
all
the
time
that
no
man
on
this
earth
would
ever
take
the
place
in
my
heart
that
had
been
given
to
my
poor
frank
“Still
if
had
married
lord
st
simon
of
course
i’d
have
done
my
duty
by
him
we
can’t
command
our
love
but
we
can
our
actions
went
to
the
altar
with
him
with
the
intention
to
make
him
just
as
good
wife
as
it
was
in
me
to
be
but
you
may
imagine
what
felt
when
just
as
came
to
the
altar
rails
glanced
back
and
saw
frank
standing
and
looking
at
me
out
of
the
first
pew
thought
it
was
his
ghost
at
first
but
when
looked
again
there
he
was
still
with
kind
of
question
in
his
eyes
as
if
to
ask
me
whether
were
glad
or
sorry
to
see
him
wonder
didn’t
drop
know
that
everything
was
turning
round
and
the
words
of
the
clergyman
were
just
like
the
buzz
of
bee
in
my
ear
didn’t
know
what
to
do
should
stop
the
service
and
make
scene
in
the
church
glanced
at
him
again
and
he
seemed
to
know
what
was
thinking
for
he
raised
his
finger
to
his
lips
to
tell
me
to
be
still
then
saw
him
scribble
on
piece
of
paper
and
knew
that
he
was
writing
me
note
as
passed
his
pew
on
the
way
out
dropped
my
bouquet
over
to
him
and
he
slipped
the
note
into
my
hand
when
he
returned
me
the
flowers
it
was
only
line
asking
me
to
join
him
when
he
made
the
sign
to
me
to
do
so
of
course
never
doubted
for
moment
that
my
first
duty
was
now
to
him
and
determined
to
do
just
whatever
he
might
direct
“When
got
back
told
my
maid
who
had
known
him
in
california
and
had
always
been
his
friend
ordered
her
to
say
nothing
but
to
get
few
things
packed
and
my
ulster
ready
know
ought
to
have
spoken
to
lord
st
simon
but
it
was
dreadful
hard
before
his
mother
and
all
those
great
people
just
made
up
my
mind
to
run
away
and
explain
afterwards
hadn’t
been
at
the
table
ten
minutes
before
saw
frank
out
of
the
window
at
the
other
side
of
the
road
he
beckoned
to
me
and
then
began
walking
into
the
park
slipped
out
put
on
my
things
and
followed
him
some
woman
came
talking
something
or
other
about
lord
st
simon
to
me
seemed
to
me
from
the
little
heard
as
if
he
had
little
secret
of
his
own
before
marriage
also
but
managed
to
get
away
from
her
and
soon
overtook
frank
we
got
into
cab
together
and
away
we
drove
to
some
lodgings
he
had
taken
in
gordon
square
and
that
was
my
true
wedding
after
all
those
years
of
waiting
frank
had
been
prisoner
among
the
apaches
had
escaped
came
on
to
’Frisco
found
that
had
given
him
up
for
dead
and
had
gone
to
england
followed
me
there
and
had
come
upon
me
at
last
on
the
very
morning
of
my
second
wedding
“I
saw
it
in
paper
explained
the
american
“It
gave
the
name
and
the
church
but
not
where
the
lady
lived
“Then
we
had
talk
as
to
what
we
should
do
and
frank
was
all
for
openness
but
was
so
ashamed
of
it
all
that
felt
as
if
should
like
to
vanish
away
and
never
see
any
of
them
again
just
sending
line
to
pa
perhaps
to
show
him
that
was
alive
it
was
awful
to
me
to
think
of
all
those
lords
and
ladies
sitting
round
that
breakfast
table
and
waiting
for
me
to
come
back
so
frank
took
my
wedding
clothes
and
things
and
made
bundle
of
them
so
that
should
not
be
traced
and
dropped
them
away
somewhere
where
no
one
could
find
them
it
is
likely
that
we
should
have
gone
on
to
paris
to
morrow
only
that
this
good
gentleman
mr
holmes
came
round
to
us
this
evening
though
how
he
found
us
is
more
than
can
think
and
he
showed
us
very
clearly
and
kindly
that
was
wrong
and
that
frank
was
right
and
that
we
should
be
putting
ourselves
in
the
wrong
if
we
were
so
secret
then
he
offered
to
give
us
chance
of
talking
to
lord
st
simon
alone
and
so
we
came
right
away
round
to
his
rooms
at
once
now
robert
you
have
heard
it
all
and
am
very
sorry
if
have
given
you
pain
and
hope
that
you
do
not
think
very
meanly
of
me
lord
st
simon
had
by
no
means
relaxed
his
rigid
attitude
but
had
listened
with
frowning
brow
and
compressed
lip
to
this
long
narrative
“Excuse
me
he
said
“but
it
is
not
my
custom
to
discuss
my
most
intimate
personal
affairs
in
this
public
manner
“Then
you
won’t
forgive
me
you
won’t
shake
hands
before
go
“Oh
certainly
if
it
would
give
you
any
pleasure
he
put
out
his
hand
and
coldly
grasped
that
which
she
extended
to
him
“I
had
hoped
suggested
holmes
“that
you
would
have
joined
us
in
friendly
supper
“I
think
that
there
you
ask
little
too
much
responded
his
lordship
“I
may
be
forced
to
acquiesce
in
these
recent
developments
but
can
hardly
be
expected
to
make
merry
over
them
think
that
with
your
permission
will
now
wish
you
all
very
good
night
he
included
us
all
in
sweeping
bow
and
stalked
out
of
the
room
“Then
trust
that
you
at
least
will
honour
me
with
your
company
said
sherlock
holmes
“It
is
always
joy
to
meet
an
american
mr
moulton
for
am
one
of
those
who
believe
that
the
folly
of
monarch
and
the
blundering
of
minister
in
far
gone
years
will
not
prevent
our
children
from
being
some
day
citizens
of
the
same
world
wide
country
under
flag
which
shall
be
quartering
of
the
union
jack
with
the
stars
and
stripes
“The
case
has
been
an
interesting
one
remarked
holmes
when
our
visitors
had
left
us
“because
it
serves
to
show
very
clearly
how
simple
the
explanation
may
be
of
an
affair
which
at
first
sight
seems
to
be
almost
inexplicable
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
the
sequence
of
events
as
narrated
by
this
lady
and
nothing
stranger
than
the
result
when
viewed
for
instance
by
mr
lestrade
of
scotland
yard
“You
were
not
yourself
at
fault
at
all
then
“From
the
first
two
facts
were
very
obvious
to
me
the
one
that
the
lady
had
been
quite
willing
to
undergo
the
wedding
ceremony
the
other
that
she
had
repented
of
it
within
few
minutes
of
returning
home
obviously
something
had
occurred
during
the
morning
then
to
cause
her
to
change
her
mind
what
could
that
something
be
she
could
not
have
spoken
to
anyone
when
she
was
out
for
she
had
been
in
the
company
of
the
bridegroom
had
she
seen
someone
then
if
she
had
it
must
be
someone
from
america
because
she
had
spent
so
short
time
in
this
country
that
she
could
hardly
have
allowed
anyone
to
acquire
so
deep
an
influence
over
her
that
the
mere
sight
of
him
would
induce
her
to
change
her
plans
so
completely
you
see
we
have
already
arrived
by
process
of
exclusion
at
the
idea
that
she
might
have
seen
an
american
then
who
could
this
american
be
and
why
should
he
possess
so
much
influence
over
her
it
might
be
lover
it
might
be
husband
her
young
womanhood
had
knew
been
spent
in
rough
scenes
and
under
strange
conditions
so
far
had
got
before
ever
heard
lord
st
simon’s
narrative
when
he
told
us
of
man
in
pew
of
the
change
in
the
bride’s
manner
of
so
transparent
device
for
obtaining
note
as
the
dropping
of
bouquet
of
her
resort
to
her
confidential
maid
and
of
her
very
significant
allusion
to
claim
jumping
which
in
miners’
parlance
means
taking
possession
of
that
which
another
person
has
prior
claim
to
the
whole
situation
became
absolutely
clear
she
had
gone
off
with
man
and
the
man
was
either
lover
or
was
previous
husband
the
chances
being
in
favour
of
the
latter
“And
how
in
the
world
did
you
find
them
“It
might
have
been
difficult
but
friend
lestrade
held
information
in
his
hands
the
value
of
which
he
did
not
himself
know
the
initials
were
of
course
of
the
highest
importance
but
more
valuable
still
was
it
to
know
that
within
week
he
had
settled
his
bill
at
one
of
the
most
select
london
hotels
“How
did
you
deduce
the
select
“By
the
select
prices
eight
shillings
for
bed
and
eightpence
for
glass
of
sherry
pointed
to
one
of
the
most
expensive
hotels
there
are
not
many
in
london
which
charge
at
that
rate
in
the
second
one
which
visited
in
northumberland
avenue
learned
by
an
inspection
of
the
book
that
francis
moulton
an
american
gentleman
had
left
only
the
day
before
and
on
looking
over
the
entries
against
him
came
upon
the
very
items
which
had
seen
in
the
duplicate
bill
his
letters
were
to
be
forwarded
to
226
gordon
square
so
thither
travelled
and
being
fortunate
enough
to
find
the
loving
couple
at
home
ventured
to
give
them
some
paternal
advice
and
to
point
out
to
them
that
it
would
be
better
in
every
way
that
they
should
make
their
position
little
clearer
both
to
the
general
public
and
to
lord
st
simon
in
particular
invited
them
to
meet
him
here
and
as
you
see
made
him
keep
the
appointment

“But
with
no
very
good
result
remarked
“His
conduct
was
certainly
not
very
gracious
“Ah
watson
said
holmes
smiling
“perhaps
you
would
not
be
very
gracious
either
if
after
all
the
trouble
of
wooing
and
wedding
you
found
yourself
deprived
in
an
instant
of
wife
and
of
fortune
think
that
we
may
judge
lord
st
simon
very
mercifully
and
thank
our
stars
that
we
are
never
likely
to
find
ourselves
in
the
same
position
draw
your
chair
up
and
hand
me
my
violin
for
the
only
problem
we
have
still
to
solve
is
how
to
while
away
these
bleak
autumnal
evenings
xi
the
adventure
of
the
beryl
coronet
“Holmes
said
as
stood
one
morning
in
our
bow
window
looking
down
the
street
“here
is
madman
coming
along
it
seems
rather
sad
that
his
relatives
should
allow
him
to
come
out
alone
my
friend
rose
lazily
from
his
armchair
and
stood
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
dressing
gown
looking
over
my
shoulder
it
was
bright
crisp
february
morning
and
the
snow
of
the
day
before
still
lay
deep
upon
the
ground
shimmering
brightly
in
the
wintry
sun
down
the
centre
of
baker
street
it
had
been
ploughed
into
brown
crumbly
band
by
the
traffic
but
at
either
side
and
on
the
heaped
up
edges
of
the
foot
paths
it
still
lay
as
white
as
when
it
fell
the
grey
pavement
had
been
cleaned
and
scraped
but
was
still
dangerously
slippery
so
that
there
were
fewer
passengers
than
usual
indeed
from
the
direction
of
the
metropolitan
station
no
one
was
coming
save
the
single
gentleman
whose
eccentric
conduct
had
drawn
my
attention
he
was
man
of
about
fifty
tall
portly
and
imposing
with
massive
strongly
marked
face
and
commanding
figure
he
was
dressed
in
sombre
yet
rich
style
in
black
frock
coat
shining
hat
neat
brown
gaiters
and
well
cut
pearl
grey
trousers
yet
his
actions
were
in
absurd
contrast
to
the
dignity
of
his
dress
and
features
for
he
was
running
hard
with
occasional
little
springs
such
as
weary
man
gives
who
is
little
accustomed
to
set
any
tax
upon
his
legs
as
he
ran
he
jerked
his
hands
up
and
down
waggled
his
head
and
writhed
his
face
into
the
most
extraordinary
contortions
“What
on
earth
can
be
the
matter
with
him
asked
“He
is
looking
up
at
the
numbers
of
the
houses
“I
believe
that
he
is
coming
here
said
holmes
rubbing
his
hands
“Here
“Yes
rather
think
he
is
coming
to
consult
me
professionally
think
that
recognise
the
symptoms
ha
did
not
tell
you
as
he
spoke
the
man
puffing
and
blowing
rushed
at
our
door
and
pulled
at
our
bell
until
the
whole
house
resounded
with
the
clanging
few
moments
later
he
was
in
our
room
still
puffing
still
gesticulating
but
with
so
fixed
look
of
grief
and
despair
in
his
eyes
that
our
smiles
were
turned
in
an
instant
to
horror
and
pity
for
while
he
could
not
get
his
words
out
but
swayed
his
body
and
plucked
at
his
hair
like
one
who
has
been
driven
to
the
extreme
limits
of
his
reason
then
suddenly
springing
to
his
feet
he
beat
his
head
against
the
wall
with
such
force
that
we
both
rushed
upon
him
and
tore
him
away
to
the
centre
of
the
room
sherlock
holmes
pushed
him
down
into
the
easy
chair
and
sitting
beside
him
patted
his
hand
and
chatted
with
him
in
the
easy
soothing
tones
which
he
knew
so
well
how
to
employ
“You
have
come
to
me
to
tell
your
story
have
you
not
said
he
“You
are
fatigued
with
your
haste
pray
wait
until
you
have
recovered
yourself
and
then
shall
be
most
happy
to
look
into
any
little
problem
which
you
may
submit
to
me
the
man
sat
for
minute
or
more
with
heaving
chest
fighting
against
his
emotion
then
he
passed
his
handkerchief
over
his
brow
set
his
lips
tight
and
turned
his
face
towards
us
“No
doubt
you
think
me
mad
said
he
“I
see
that
you
have
had
some
great
trouble
responded
holmes
“God
knows
have
trouble
which
is
enough
to
unseat
my
reason
so
sudden
and
so
terrible
is
it
public
disgrace
might
have
faced
although
am
man
whose
character
has
never
yet
borne
stain
private
affliction
also
is
the
lot
of
every
man
but
the
two
coming
together
and
in
so
frightful
form
have
been
enough
to
shake
my
very
soul
besides
it
is
not
alone
the
very
noblest
in
the
land
may
suffer
unless
some
way
be
found
out
of
this
horrible
affair
“Pray
compose
yourself
sir
said
holmes
“and
let
me
have
clear
account
of
who
you
are
and
what
it
is
that
has
befallen
you
“My
name
answered
our
visitor
“is
probably
familiar
to
your
ears
am
alexander
holder
of
the
banking
firm
of
holder
stevenson
of
threadneedle
street
the
name
was
indeed
well
known
to
us
as
belonging
to
the
senior
partner
in
the
second
largest
private
banking
concern
in
the
city
of
london
what
could
have
happened
then
to
bring
one
of
the
foremost
citizens
of
london
to
this
most
pitiable
pass
we
waited
all
curiosity
until
with
another
effort
he
braced
himself
to
tell
his
story
“I
feel
that
time
is
of
value
said
he
“that
is
why
hastened
here
when
the
police
inspector
suggested
that
should
secure
your
co
operation
came
to
baker
street
by
the
underground
and
hurried
from
there
on
foot
for
the
cabs

slowly
through
this
snow
that
is
why
was
so
out
of
breath
for

man
who
takes
very
little
exercise
feel
better
now
and
will
put
the
facts
before
you
as
shortly
and
yet
as
clearly
as
can
“It
is
of
course
well
known
to
you
that
in
successful
banking
business
as
much
depends
upon
our
being
able
to
find
remunerative
investments
for
our
funds
as
upon
our
increasing
our
connection
and
the
number
of
our
depositors
one
of
our
most
lucrative
means
of
laying
out
money
is
in
the
shape
of
loans
where
the
security
is
unimpeachable
we
have
done
good
deal
in
this
direction
during
the
last
few
years
and
there
are
many
noble
families
to
whom
we
have
advanced
large
sums
upon
the
security
of
their
pictures
libraries
or
plate
“Yesterday
morning
was
seated
in
my
office
at
the
bank
when
card
was
brought
in
to
me
by
one
of
the
clerks
started
when
saw
the
name
for
it
was
that
of
none
other
than
well
perhaps
even
to
you
had
better
say
no
more
than
that
it
was
name
which
is
household
word
all
over
the
earth
one
of
the
highest
noblest
most
exalted
names
in
england
was
overwhelmed
by
the
honour
and
attempted
when
he
entered
to
say
so
but
he
plunged
at
once
into
business
with
the
air
of
man
who
wishes
to
hurry
quickly
through
disagreeable
task
‘Mr
holder
said
he
‘I
have
been
informed
that
you
are
in
the
habit
of
advancing
money
‘The
firm
does
so
when
the
security
is
good
answered
‘It
is
absolutely
essential
to
me
said
he
‘that
should
have
£50
000
at
once
could
of
course
borrow
so
trifling
sum
ten
times
over
from
my
friends
but
much
prefer
to
make
it
matter
of
business
and
to
carry
out
that
business
myself
in
my
position
you
can
readily
understand
that
it
is
unwise
to
place
one’s
self
under
obligations
‘For
how
long
may
ask
do
you
want
this
sum
asked
‘Next
monday
have
large
sum
due
to
me
and
shall
then
most
certainly
repay
what
you
advance
with
whatever
interest
you
think
it
right
to
charge
but
it
is
very
essential
to
me
that
the
money
should
be
paid
at
once
‘I
should
be
happy
to
advance
it
without
further
parley
from
my
own
private
purse
said
‘were
it
not
that
the
strain
would
be
rather
more
than
it
could
bear
if
on
the
other
hand
am
to
do
it
in
the
name
of

then
in
justice
to
my
partner
must
insist
that
even
in
your
case
every
businesslike
precaution
should
be
taken
‘I
should
much
prefer
to
have
it

said
he

up
square

he
had
laid
beside
his

‘You
have
doubtless
heard
of
the
beryl

‘Precisely

there
imbedded

lay
the
magnificent

he
had
named
‘There
are
thirty
nine
enormous
beryls
said
he
‘and
the
price
of
the
gold
chasing
is
incalculable
the
lowest
estimate
would
put
the
worth
of
the
coronet
at
double
the
sum

have
asked

prepared
to
leave
it
with
you

“I
took
the

into

looked
in
some
perplexity
from
it
to
my
illustrious
client
‘You
doubt
its
value
he
asked
‘Not
at
all

doubt—’
‘The
propriety

leaving
it

may
set
your

at

“Seeing
that
my
client
was
anxious
to
leave
said
no
more
but
calling
for
my
cashier
ordered
him
to
pay
over
fifty
£1000
notes
when
was
alone
once
more
however
with
the
precious
case
lying
upon
the
table
in
front
of
me
could
not
but
think
with
some
misgivings
of
the
immense
responsibility
which
it
entailed
upon
me
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
as
it
was
national
possession
horrible
scandal
would
ensue
if
any
misfortune
should
occur
to
it
already
regretted
having
ever
consented
to
take
charge
of
it
however
it
was
too
late
to
alter
the
matter
now
so
locked
it
up
in
my
private
safe
and
turned
once
more
to
my
work
“When
evening
came
felt
that
it
would
be
an
imprudence
to
leave
so
precious
thing
in
the
office
behind
me
bankers’
safes
had
been
forced
before
now
and
why
should
not
mine
be
if
so
how
terrible
would
be
the
position
in
which
should
find
myself
determined
therefore
that
for
the
next
few
days
would
always
carry
the
case
backward
and
forward
with
me
so
that
it
might
never
be
really
out
of
my
reach
with
this
intention
called
cab
and
drove
out
to
my
house
at
streatham
carrying
the
jewel
with
me
did
not
breathe
freely
until
had
taken
it
upstairs
and
locked
it
in
the
bureau
of
my
dressing
room
“And
now
word
as
to
my
household
mr
holmes
for
wish
you
to
thoroughly
understand
the
situation
my
groom
and
my
page
sleep
out
of
the
house
and
may
be
set
aside
altogether
have
three
maid
servants
who
have
been
with
me
number
of
years
and
whose
absolute
reliability
is
quite
above
suspicion
another
lucy
parr
the
second
waiting
maid
has
only
been
in
my
service
few
months
she
came
with
an
excellent
character
however
and
has
always
given
me
satisfaction
she
is
very
pretty
girl
and
has
attracted
admirers
who
have
occasionally
hung
about
the
place
that
is
the
only
drawback
which
we
have
found
to
her
but
we
believe
her
to
be
thoroughly
good
girl
in
every
way
“So
much
for
the
servants
my
family
itself
is
so
small
that
it

not

me
long

describe

an
only

has
been
disappointment
to
me
mr

grievous
disappointment
have
no
doubt
that
am
myself
to
blame
people
tell
me
that
have
spoiled
him
very
likely
have
when
my
dear
wife
died
felt
that
he
was
all
had
to
love
could
not
bear
to
see
the
smile
fade
even
for
moment
from
his
face
have
never
denied
him
wish
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
for
both
of
us
had
been
sterner
but
meant
it
for
the
best
“It
was
naturally
my
intention
that
he
should
succeed
me
in
my
business
but
he
was
not
of
business
turn
he
was
wild
wayward
and
to
speak
the
truth
could
not
trust
him
in
the
handling
of
large
sums
of
money
when
he
was
young
he
became
member
of
an
aristocratic
club
and
there
having
charming
manners
he
was
soon
the
intimate
of
number
of
men
with
long
purses
and
expensive
habits
he
learned
to
play
heavily
at
cards
and
to
squander
money
on
the
turf
until
he
had
again
and
again
to
come
to
me
and
implore
me
to
give
him
an
advance
upon
his
allowance
that
he
might
settle
his
debts
of
honour
he
tried
more
than
once
to
break
away
from
the
dangerous
company
which
he
was
keeping
but
each
time
the
influence
of
his
friend
sir
george
burnwell
was
enough
to
draw
him
back
again
“And
indeed
could
not
wonder
that
such
man
as
sir
george
burnwell
should
gain
an
influence
over
him
for
he
has
frequently
brought
him
to
my
house
and
have
found
myself
that
could
hardly
resist
the
fascination
of
his
manner
he
is
older
than
arthur
man
of
the
world
to
his
finger
tips
one
who
had
been
everywhere
seen
everything
brilliant
talker
and
man
of
great
personal
beauty
yet
when
think
of
him
in
cold
blood
far
away
from
the
glamour
of
his
presence
am
convinced
from
his
cynical
speech
and
the
look
which
have
caught
in
his
eyes
that
he
is
one
who
should
be
deeply
distrusted
so
think
and
so
too
thinks
my
little
mary
who
has
woman’s
quick
insight
into
character
“And
now
there
is
only
she
to
be
described
she
is
my
niece
but
when
my
brother
died
five
years
ago
and
left
her
alone
in
the
world
adopted
her
and
have
looked
upon
her
ever
since
as
my
daughter
she
is
sunbeam
in
my
house
sweet
loving
beautiful
wonderful
manager
and
housekeeper
yet
as
tender
and
quiet
and
gentle
as
woman
could
be
she
is
my
right
hand
do
not
know
what
could
do
without
her
in
only
one
matter
has
she
ever
gone
against
my
wishes
twice
my
boy
has
asked
her
to
marry
him
for
he
loves
her
devotedly
but
each
time
she
has
refused
him
think
that
if
anyone
could
have
drawn
him
into
the
right
path
it
would
have
been
she
and
that
his
marriage
might
have
changed
his
whole
life
but
now
alas
it
is
too
late
forever
too
late
“Now
mr
holmes
you
know
the
people
who
live
under
my
roof
and
shall
continue
with
my
miserable
story
“When
we
were
taking
coffee
in
the
drawing
room
that
night
after
dinner
told
arthur
and
mary
my
experience
and
of
the
precious
treasure
which
we
had
under
our
roof
suppressing
only
the
name
of
my
client
lucy
parr
who
had
brought
in
the
coffee
had
am
sure
left
the
room
but
cannot
swear
that
the
door
was
closed
mary
and
arthur
were
much
interested
and
wished
to
see
the
famous
coronet
but
thought
it
better
not
to
disturb
it
‘Where
have
you
put
it
asked
arthur
‘In
my
own
bureau
‘Well
hope
to
goodness
the
house
won’t
be
burgled
during
the
night
said
he
‘It
is
locked
up
answered
‘Oh
any
old
key
will
fit
that
bureau
when
was
youngster
have
opened
it
myself
with
the
key
of
the
box
room
cupboard
“He
often
had
wild
way
of
talking
so
that
thought
little
of
what
he
said
he
followed
me
to
my
room
however
that
night
with
very
grave
face
‘Look
here
dad
said
he
with
his
eyes
cast
down
‘can
you
let
me
have
£200
‘No
cannot
answered
sharply
‘I
have
been
far
too
generous
with
you
in
money
matters
‘You
have
been
very
kind
said
he
‘but
must
have
this
money
or
else
can
never
show
my
face
inside
the
club
again
‘And
very
good
thing
too
cried
‘Yes
but
you
would
not
have
me
leave
it
dishonoured
man
said
he
‘I
could
not
bear
the
disgrace
must
raise
the
money
in
some
way
and
if
you
will
not
let
me
have
it
then
must
try
other
means
“I
was
very
angry
for
this
was
the
third
demand
during
the
month
‘You
shall
not
have
farthing
from
me
cried
on
which
he
bowed
and
left
the
room
without
another
word
“When
he
was
gone
unlocked
my
bureau
made
sure
that
my
treasure
was
safe
and
locked
it
again
then
started
to
go
round
the
house
to
see
that
all
was
secure
duty
which
usually
leave
to
mary
but
which
thought
it
well
to
perform
myself
that
night
as
came
down
the
stairs
saw
mary
herself
at
the
side
window
of
the
hall
which
she
closed
and
fastened
as
approached
‘Tell
me
dad
said
she
looking
thought
little
disturbed
‘did
you
give
lucy
the
maid
leave
to
go
out
to
night
‘Certainly
not
‘She
came
in
just
now
by
the
back
door
have
no
doubt
that
she
has
only
been
to
the
side
gate
to
see
someone
but
think
that
it
is
hardly
safe
and
should
be
stopped
‘You
must
speak
to
her
in
the
morning
or
will
if
you
prefer
it
are
you
sure
that
everything
is
fastened
‘Quite
sure
dad
‘Then
good
night
kissed
her
and
went
up
to
my
bedroom
again
where
was
soon
asleep
“I
am
endeavouring
to
tell
you
everything
mr
holmes
which
may
have
any
bearing
upon
the
case
but
beg
that
you
will
question
me
upon
any
point
which
do
not
make
clear
“On
the
contrary
your
statement
is
singularly
lucid
“I
come
to
part
of
my
story
now
in
which
should
wish
to
be
particularly
so
am
not
very
heavy
sleeper
and
the
anxiety
in
my
mind
tended
no
doubt
to
make
me
even
less
so
than
usual
about
two
in
the
morning
then
was
awakened
by
some
sound
in
the
house
it
had
ceased
ere
was
wide
awake
but
it
had
left
an
impression
behind
it
as
though
window
had
gently
closed
somewhere
lay
listening
with
all
my
ears
suddenly
to
my
horror
there
was
distinct
sound
of
footsteps
moving
softly

the
next
room

out
of

all
palpitating
with
fear

peeped
round
the
corner

‘Arthur
screamed
‘you
villain
you
thief
how
dare
you
touch
that
coronet
“The
gas
was
half
up
as
had
left
it
and
my
unhappy
boy
dressed
only
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
was
standing
beside
the
light
holding
the
coronet
in
his
hands
he
appeared
to
be
wrenching
at
it
or
bending
it
with
all
his
strength
at
my
cry
he
dropped
it
from
his
grasp
and
turned
as
pale
as
death
snatched
it
up
and
examined
it
one
of
the
gold
corners
with
three
of
the
beryls
in
it
was
missing
‘You
blackguard
shouted
beside
myself
with
rage
‘You
have
destroyed
it
you
have
dishonoured
me
forever
where
are
the
jewels
which
you
have
stolen
‘Stolen
he
cried
‘Yes
thief
roared
shaking
him
by
the
shoulder
‘There
are
none
missing
there
cannot
be
any
missing
said
he
‘There
are
three
missing
and
you
know
where
they
are
must
call
you
liar
as
well
as
thief
did
not
see
you
trying
to
tear
off
another
piece
‘You
have
called
me
names
enough
said
he
‘I
will
not
stand
it
any
longer
shall
not
say
another
word
about
this
business
since
you
have
chosen
to
insult
me
will
leave
your
house
in
the
morning
and
make
my
own
way
in
the
world
‘You
shall
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
the
police
cried
half
mad
with
grief
and
rage
‘I
shall
have
this
matter
probed
to
the
bottom
‘You
shall
learn
nothing
from
me
said
he
with
passion
such
as
should
not
have
thought
was
in
his
nature
‘If
you
choose
to
call
the
police
let
the
police
find
what
they
can
“By
this
time
the
whole
house
was
astir
for
had
raised
my
voice
in
my
anger
mary
was
the
first
to
rush
into
my
room
and
at
the
sight
of
the
coronet
and
of
arthur’s
face
she
read
the
whole
story
and
with
scream
fell
down
senseless
on
the
ground
sent
the
house
maid
for
the
police
and
put
the
investigation
into
their
hands
at
once
when
the
inspector
and
constable
entered
the
house
arthur
who
had
stood
sullenly
with
his
arms
folded
asked
me
whether
it
was
my
intention
to
charge
him
with
theft
answered
that
it
had
ceased
to
be
private
matter
but
had
become
public
one
since
the
ruined
coronet
was
national
property
was
determined
that
the
law
should
have
its
way
in
everything
‘At
least
said
he
‘you
will
not
have
me
arrested
at
once
it
would
be
to
your
advantage
as
well
as
mine
if
might
leave
the
house
for
five
minutes
‘That
you
may
get
away
or
perhaps
that
you
may
conceal
what
you
have
stolen
said
and
then
realising
the
dreadful
position
in
which
was
placed
implored
him
to
remember
that
not
only
my
honour
but
that
of
one
who
was
far
greater
than
was
at
stake
and
that
he
threatened
to
raise
scandal
which
would
convulse
the
nation
he
might
avert
it
all
if
he
would
but
tell
me
what
he
had
done
with
the
three
missing
stones
‘You
may
as
well
face
the
matter
said
‘you
have
been
caught
in
the
act
and
no
confession
could
make
your
guilt
more
heinous
if
you
but
make
such
reparation
as
is
in
your
power
by
telling
us
where
the
beryls
are
all
shall
be
forgiven
and
forgotten
‘Keep
your
forgiveness
for
those
who
ask
for
it
he
answered
turning
away
from
me
with
sneer
saw
that
he
was
too
hardened
for
any
words
of
mine
to
influence
him
there
was
but
one
way
for
it
called
in
the
inspector
and
gave
him
into
custody
search
was
made
at
once
not
only
of
his
person
but
of
his
room
and
of
every
portion
of
the
house
where
he
could
possibly
have
concealed
the
gems
but
no
trace
of
them
could
be
found
nor
would
the
wretched
boy
open
his
mouth
for
all
our
persuasions
and
our
threats
this
morning
he
was
removed
to
cell
and
after
going
through
all
the
police
formalities
have
hurried
round
to
you
to
implore
you
to
use
your
skill
in
unravelling
the
matter
the
police
have
openly
confessed
that
they
can
at
present
make
nothing
of
it
you
may
go
to
any
expense
which
you
think
necessary
have
already
offered
reward
of
£1000
my
god
what
shall
do
have
lost
my
honour
my
gems
and
my
son
in
one
night
oh
what
shall
do
he
put
hand
on
either
side
of
his
head
and
rocked
himself
to
and
fro
droning
to
himself
like
child
whose
grief
has
got
beyond
words
sherlock
holmes
sat
silent
for
some
few
minutes
with
his
brows
knitted
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
fire
“Do
you
receive
much
company
he
asked
“None
save
my
partner
with
his
family
and
an
occasional
friend
of
arthur’s
sir
george
burnwell
has
been
several
times
lately
no
one
else
think
“Do
you
go
out
much
in
society
“Arthur
does
mary
and
stay
at
home
we
neither
of
us
care
for
it
“That
is
unusual
in
young
girl
“She
is
of
quiet
nature
besides
she
is
not
so
very
young
she
is
four
and
twenty
“This
matter
from
what
you
say
seems
to
have
been
shock
to
her
also
“Terrible
she
is
even
more
affected
than
“You
have
neither
of
you
any
doubt
as
to
your
son’s
guilt
“How
can
we
have
when
saw
him
with
my
own
eyes
with
the
coronet
in
his
hands
“I
hardly
consider
that
conclusive
proof
was
the
remainder
of
the
coronet
at
all
injured
“Yes
it
was
twisted
“Do
you
not
think
then
that
he
might
have
been
trying
to
straighten
it
“God
bless
you
are
doing
what
you
can
for
him
and
for
me
but
it
is
too
heavy
task
what
was
he
doing
there
at
all
if
his
purpose
were
innocent
why
did
he
not
say
so
“Precisely
and
if
it
were
guilty
why
did
he
not
invent
lie
his
silence
appears
to
me
to
cut
both
ways
there
are
several
singular
points
about
the
case
what
did
the
police
think
of
the
noise
which
awoke
you
from
your
sleep
“They
considered
that
it
might
be
caused
by
arthur’s
closing
his
bedroom
door
“A
likely
story
as
if
man
bent
on
felony
would
slam
his
door
so
as
to
wake
household
what
did
they
say
then
of
the
disappearance
of
these
gems
“They
are
still
sounding
the
planking
and
probing
the
furniture
in
the
hope
of
finding
them
“Have
they
thought
of
looking
outside
the
house
“Yes
they
have
shown
extraordinary
energy
the
whole
garden
has
already
been
minutely
examined
“Now
my
dear
sir
said
holmes
“is
it
not
obvious
to
you
now
that
this
matter
really
strikes
very
much
deeper
than
either
you
or
the
police
were
at
first
inclined
to
think
it
appeared
to
you
to
be
simple
case
to
me
it
seems
exceedingly
complex
consider
what
is
involved
by
your
theory
you
suppose
that
your
son
came
down
from
his
bed
went
at
great
risk
to
your
dressing
room
opened
your
bureau
took
out
your
coronet
broke
off
by
main
force
small
portion
of
it
went
off
to
some
other
place
concealed
three
gems
out
of
the
thirty
nine
with
such
skill
that
nobody
can
find
them
and
then
returned
with
the
other
thirty
six
into
the
room
in
which
he
exposed
himself
to
the
greatest
danger
of
being
discovered
ask
you
now
is
such
theory
tenable
“But
what
other
is
there
cried
the
banker
with
gesture
of
despair
“If
his
motives
were
innocent
why
does
he
not
explain
them
“It
is
our
task
to
find
that
out
replied
holmes
“so
now
if
you
please
mr
holder
we
will
set
off
for
streatham
together
and
devote
an
hour
to
glancing
little
more
closely
into
details
my
friend
insisted
upon
my
accompanying
them
in
their
expedition
which
was
eager
enough
to
do
for
my
curiosity
and
sympathy
were
deeply
stirred
by
the
story
to
which
we
had
listened
confess
that
the
guilt
of
the
banker’s
son
appeared
to
me
to
be
as
obvious
as
it
did
to
his
unhappy
father
but
still
had
such
faith
in
holmes’
judgment
that
felt
that
there
must
be
some
grounds
for
hope
as
long
as
he
was
dissatisfied
with
the
accepted
explanation
he
hardly
spoke
word
the
whole
way
out
to
the
southern
suburb
but
sat
with
his
chin
upon
his
breast
and
his
hat
drawn
over
his
eyes
sunk
in
the
deepest
thought
our
client
appeared
to
have
taken
fresh
heart
at
the
little
glimpse
of
hope
which
had
been
presented
to
him
and
he
even
broke
into
desultory
chat
with
me
over
his
business
affairs
short
railway
journey
and
shorter
walk
brought
us
to
fairbank
the
modest
residence
of
the
great
financier
fairbank
was
good
sized
square
house
of
white
stone
standing
back
little
from
the
road
double
carriage
sweep
with
snow
clad
lawn
stretched
down
in
front
to
two
large
iron
gates
which
closed
the
entrance
on
the
right
side
was
small
wooden
thicket
which
led
into
narrow
path
between
two
neat
hedges
stretching
from
the
road
to
the
kitchen
door
and
forming
the
tradesmen’s
entrance
on
the
left
ran
lane
which
led
to
the
stables
and
was
not
itself
within
the
grounds
at
all
being
public
though
little
used
thoroughfare
holmes
left
us
standing
at
the
door
and
walked
slowly
all
round
the
house
across
the
front
down
the
tradesmen’s
path
and
so
round
by
the
garden
behind
into
the
stable
lane
so
long
was
he
that
mr
holder
and
went
into
the
dining
room
and
waited
by
the
fire
until
he
should
return
we
were
sitting
there
in
silence
when
the
door
opened
and
young
lady
came
in
she
was
rather
above
the
middle
height
slim
with
dark
hair
and
eyes
which
seemed
the
darker
against
the
absolute
pallor
of
her
skin
do
not
think
that
have
ever
seen
such
deadly
paleness
in
woman’s
face
her
lips
too
were
bloodless
but
her
eyes
were
flushed
with
crying
as
she
swept
silently
into
the
room
she
impressed
me
with
greater
sense
of
grief
than
the
banker
had
done
in
the
morning
and
it
was
the
more
striking
in
her
as
she
was
evidently
woman
of
strong
character
with
immense
capacity
for
self
restraint
disregarding
my
presence
she
went
straight
to
her
uncle
and
passed
her
hand
over
his
head
with
sweet
womanly
caress

“You
have
given
orders
that
arthur
should
be

you

she
asked
“No
no
my
girl
the
matter
must
be
probed
to
the
bottom
“But
am
so
sure
that
he
is
innocent
you
know
what
woman’s
instincts
are
know
that
he
has
done
no
harm
and
that
you
will
be
sorry
for
having
acted
so
harshly
“Why
is
he
silent
then
if
he
is
innocent
“Who
knows
perhaps
because
he
was
so
angry
that
you
should
suspect
him
“How
could
help
suspecting
him
when
actually
saw
him
with
the
coronet
in
his
hand
“Oh
but
he
had
only
picked
it
up
to
look
at
it
oh
do
take
my
word
for
it
that
he
is
innocent
let
the
matter
drop
and
say
no
more
it
is
so
dreadful
to
think
of
our
dear
arthur
in
prison
“I
shall
never
let
it
drop

the
gems
are
found

your
affection
for
arthur
blinds
you

to
the
awful
consequences

from
hushing
the

up

brought
gentleman
down
from
london
to
inquire
more
deeply
into
it
“This
gentleman
she
asked
facing
round
to
me
“No
his
friend
he
wished
us
to
leave
him
alone
he
is
round
in
the
stable
lane
now
“The
stable

she
raised
her
dark
eyebrows
“What
can
he
hope
to
find
there
ah
this
suppose
is
he
trust
sir
that
you
will
succeed
in
proving
what
feel
sure
is
the
truth
that
my
cousin
arthur
is
innocent
of
this
crime
“I
fully
share
your
opinion
and
trust
with
you
that
we
may
prove
it
returned
holmes
going
back
to
the
mat
to
knock
the
snow
from
his
shoes
“I
believe
have
the
honour
of
addressing
miss
mary
holder
might
ask
you
question
or
two
“Pray
do
sir
if
it
may
help
to
clear
this
horrible
affair
up
“You
heard
nothing
yourself
last
night
“Nothing
until
my
uncle
here
began
to
speak
loudly
heard
that
and
came
down
“You
shut
up
the
windows
and
doors
the
night
before
did
you
fasten
all
the
windows
“Yes
“Were
they
all
fastened
this
morning
“Yes
“You
have
maid
who
has
sweetheart
think
that
you
remarked
to
your
uncle
last
night
that
she
had
been
out
to
see
him
“Yes
and
she
was
the
girl
who
waited
in
the
drawing
room
and
who
may
have
heard
uncle’s
remarks
about
the
coronet
“I
see
you
infer
that
she
may
have
gone
out
to
tell
her
sweetheart
and
that
the
two
may
have
planned
the
robbery
“But
what
is
the
good
of
all
these
vague
theories
cried
the
banker
impatiently
“when
have
told
you
that
saw
arthur
with
the
coronet
in
his
hands
“Wait
little
mr
holder
we
must
come
back
to
that
about
this
girl
miss

you
saw
her
return
by
the
kitchen
door

“Yes
when
went
to
see
if
the
door
was
fastened

the
night

her
slipping
in

the
man
too
in
the
gloom
“Do
you
know
him
“Oh
yes
he
is
the
green
grocer
who
brings
our
vegetables
round
his
name
is
francis
prosper
“He
stood
said
holmes
“to
the
left
of
the
door
that
is
to
say
farther
up
the
path
than
is
necessary
to
reach
the
door
“Yes
he
did
“And
he
is
man
with
wooden
leg
something
like
fear
sprang
up
in
the
young
lady’s
expressive
black
eyes
“Why
you
are
like
magician
said
she
“How
do
you
know
that
she
smiled
but
there
was
no
answering
smile
in
holmes’
thin
eager
face
“I
should
be
very
glad
now
to
go
upstairs
said
he
“I
shall
probably
wish
to
go
over
the
outside
of
the
house
again
perhaps
had
better
take
look
at
the
lower
windows
before
go
up
he
walked
swiftly
round
from
one
to
the
other
pausing
only
at
the
large
one
which
looked
from
the
hall
onto
the
stable
lane
this
he
opened
and
made
very
careful
examination
of
the
sill
with
his
powerful
magnifying
lens
“Now
we
shall
go
upstairs
said
he
at
last
the
banker’s
dressing
room
was
plainly
furnished
little
chamber
with
grey
carpet
large
bureau
and
long
mirror
holmes
went
to
the
bureau
first
and
looked
hard
at
the
lock
“Which
key
was
used
to
open
it
he
asked
“That
which
my
son
himself
indicated
that
of
the
cupboard
of
the
lumber
room
“Have
you
it
here
“That
is
it
on
the
dressing
table
sherlock
holmes
took
it
up
and
opened
the
bureau
“It
is
noiseless
lock
said
he
“It
is
no
wonder
that
it
did
not
wake
you
this
case
presume
contains
the
coronet
we
must
have
look
at
it
he
opened
the
case
and
taking
out
the
diadem
he
laid
it
upon
the
table
it
was
magnificent
specimen
of
the
jeweller’s
art
and
the
thirty
six
stones
were
the
finest
that
have
ever
seen
at
one
side
of
the
coronet
was
cracked
edge
where
corner
holding
three
gems
had
been
torn
away
“Now
mr
holder
said
holmes
“here
is
the
corner
which
corresponds
to
that
which
has
been
so
unfortunately
lost
might
beg
that
you
will
break
it
off
the
banker
recoiled
in
horror
“I
should
not
dream
of
trying
said
he
“Then
will
holmes
suddenly
bent
his
strength
upon
it
but
without
result
“I
feel
it
give
little
said
he
“but
though
am
exceptionally
strong
in
the
fingers
it
would
take
me
all
my
time
to
break
it
an
ordinary
man
could
not
do
it
now
what
do
you
think
would
happen
if
did
break
it
mr
holder
there
would
be
noise
like
pistol
shot
do
you
tell
me
that
all
this
happened
within
few
yards
of
your
bed
and
that
you
heard
nothing
of
it
“I
do
not
know
what
to
think
it
is
all
dark
to
me
“But
perhaps
it
may
grow
lighter
as
we
go
what
do
you
think
miss
holder
“I
confess
that
still
share
my
uncle’s
perplexity
“Your
son
had
no
shoes
or
slippers
on
when
you
saw
him
“He
had
nothing
on
save
only
his
trousers
and
shirt
“Thank
you
we
have
certainly
been
favoured
with
extraordinary
luck
during
this
inquiry
and
it
will
be
entirely
our
own
fault
if
we
do
not
succeed
in
clearing
the
matter
up
with
your
permission
mr
holder
shall
now
continue
my
investigations
outside
he
went
alone
at
his
own
request
for
he
explained
that
any
unnecessary
footmarks
might
make
his
task
more
difficult
for
an
hour
or
more
he
was
at
work
returning
at
last
with
his
feet
heavy
with
snow
and
his
features
as
inscrutable
as
ever
“I
think
that
have
seen
now
all
that
there
is
to
see
mr
holder
said
he
“I
can
serve
you
best
by
returning
to
my
rooms
“But
the
gems
mr
holmes
where
are
they
“I
cannot
tell
the
banker
wrung
his
hands
“I
shall
never
see
them
again
he
cried
“And
my
son
you
give
me
hopes
“My
opinion
is
in
no
way
altered
“Then
for
god’s
sake
what
was
this
dark
business
which
was
acted
in
my
house
last
night
“If
you
can
call
upon
me
at
my
baker
street
rooms
to
morrow
morning
between
nine
and
ten
shall
be
happy
to
do
what
can
to
make
it
clearer
understand
that
you
give
me
carte
blanche
to
act
for
you
provided
only
that
get
back
the
gems
and
that
you
place
no
limit
on
the
sum
may
draw
“I
would
give
my
fortune
to
have
them
back
“Very
good
shall
look
into
the
matter
between
this
and
then
good
bye
it
is
just
possible
that
may
have
to
come
over
here
again
before
evening
it
was
obvious
to
me
that
my
companion’s
mind
was
now
made
up
about
the
case
although
what
his
conclusions
were
was
more
than
could
even
dimly
imagine
several
times
during
our
homeward
journey
endeavoured
to
sound
him
upon
the
point
but
he
always
glided
away
to
some
other
topic
until
at
last
gave
it
over
in
despair
it
was
not
yet
three
when
we
found
ourselves
in
our
rooms
once
more
he
hurried
to
his
chamber
and
was
down
again
in
few
minutes
dressed
as
common
loafer
with
his
collar
turned
up
his
shiny
seedy
coat
his
red
cravat
and
his
worn
boots
he
was
perfect
sample
of
the
class
“I
think
that
this
should
do
said
he
glancing
into
the
glass
above
the
fireplace
“I
only
wish
that
you
could
come
with
me
watson
but
fear
that
it
won’t
do
may
be
on
the
trail
in
this
matter
or
may
be
following
will
o’
the
wisp
but
shall
soon
know
which
it
is
hope
that
may
be
back
in
few
hours
he
cut
slice
of
beef
from
the
joint
upon
the
sideboard
sandwiched
it
between
two
rounds
of
bread
and
thrusting
this
rude
meal
into
his
pocket
he
started
off
upon
his
expedition
had
just
finished
my
tea
when
he
returned
evidently
in
excellent
spirits
swinging
an
old
elastic
sided
boot
in
his
hand
he
chucked
it
down
into
corner
and
helped
himself
to
cup
of
tea
“I
only
looked
in
as
passed
said
he
“I
am
going
right
on
“Where
to
“Oh
to
the
other
side
of
the
west
end
it
may
be
some
time
before
get
back

wait
up
for
me

should
be

“How
are
you
getting
on
“Oh
so
nothing
to
complain
of
have
been
out
to
streatham
since
saw
you
last
but
did
not
call
at
the
house
it
is
very
sweet
little
problem
and
would
not
have
missed
it
for
good
deal
however
must
not
sit
gossiping
here
but
must
get
these
disreputable
clothes
off
and
return
to
my
highly
respectable
self
could
see
by
his
manner
that
he
had
stronger
reasons
for
satisfaction
than
his
words
alone
would
imply
his
eyes
twinkled
and
there
was
even
touch
of
colour
upon
his
sallow
cheeks
he
hastened
upstairs
and
few
minutes
later
heard
the
slam
of
the
hall
door
which
told
me
that
he
was
off
once
more
upon
his
congenial
hunt
waited
until
midnight
but
there
was
no
sign
of
his
return
so
retired
to
my
room
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
him
to
be
away
for
days
and
nights
on
end
when
he
was
hot
upon
scent
so
that
his
lateness
caused
me
no
surprise
do
not
know
at
what
hour
he
came
in
but
when
came
down
to
breakfast
in
the
morning
there
he
was
with
cup
of
coffee
in
one
hand
and
the
paper
in
the
other
as
fresh
and
trim
as
possible
“You
will
excuse
my
beginning
without
you
watson
said
he
“but
you
remember
that
our
client
has
rather
an
early
appointment
this
morning
“Why
it
is
after
nine
now
answered
“I
should
not
be
surprised

that

he
thought
heard
ring
it
was
indeed
our
friend
the
financier
was
shocked
by
the
change
which
had
come
over
him
for
his
face
which
was
naturally
of
broad
and
massive
mould
was
now
pinched
and
fallen
in
while
his
hair
seemed
to
me
at
least
shade
whiter
he
entered
with
weariness
and
lethargy
which
was
even
more
painful
than
his
violence
of
the
morning
before
and
he
dropped
heavily
into
the
armchair
which
pushed
forward
for
him
“I
do
not
know
what
have
done
to
be
so
severely
tried
said
he
“Only
two
days
ago
was
happy
and
prosperous
man
without
care
in
the
world
now
am
left
to
lonely
and
dishonoured
age
one
sorrow
comes
close
upon
the
heels
of
another
my
niece
mary
has
deserted
me
“Deserted
you
“Yes
her
bed
this
morning
had
not
been
slept
in
her
room
was
empty
and
note
for
me
lay
upon
the
hall
table
had
said
to
her
last
night
in
sorrow
and
not
in
anger
that
if
she
had
married
my
boy
all
might
have
been
well
with
him
perhaps
it
was
thoughtless
of
me
to
say
so
it
is
to
that
remark
that
she
refers
in
this
note
‘MY
dearest
uncle
feel
that
have
brought
trouble
upon
you
and
that
if
had
acted
differently
this
terrible
misfortune

never

occurred
cannot
with
this
thought
in
my
mind
ever
again

happy
under
your
roof

that
must
leave
you
forever
do
not
worry
about
my
future
for
that
is
provided
for
and
above
all
do
not

for
me

it

fruitless

an
ill

in

loving
‘MARY
“What
could
she
mean
by
that
note
mr
holmes
do
you
think
it
points
to
suicide
“No
no
nothing
of
the
kind
it
is
perhaps
the
best
possible
solution
trust
mr
holder
that
you
are
nearing
the
end
of
your
troubles
“Ha
you
say
so
you
have
heard
something
mr
holmes
you
have
learned
something
where
are
the
gems
“You
would
not
think
£1000
apiece
an
excessive
sum
for
them
“I
would
pay
ten
“That
would
be
unnecessary
three

cover
the

there
is
little

you
your
check

here
is

better
make
it
out
for
£4000
with
dazed
face
the
banker
made
out
the
required
check
holmes
walked
over
to
his
desk
took
out
little
triangular
piece
of
gold
with
three
gems
in
it
and
threw
it
down
upon
the
table
with
shriek
of
joy
our
client
clutched
it
up
“You
have
it
he
gasped
“I
am
saved
am
saved
the
reaction
of
joy
was
as
passionate
as
his
grief
had
been
and
he
hugged
his
recovered
gems
to
his
bosom
“There
is
one
other
thing
you
owe
mr
holder
said
sherlock
holmes
rather
sternly
“Owe
he
caught
up
pen
“Name
the
sum
and
will
pay
it
“No
the
debt
is
not
to
me
you
owe
very
humble
apology
to
that
noble
lad
your
son
who
has
carried
himself
in
this
matter
as
should
be
proud
to
see
my
own
son
do
should
ever
chance
to
have
one
“Then
it
was
not
arthur
who
took
them
“I
told
you
yesterday
and
repeat
to
day
that
it
was
not
“You
are
sure
of
it
then
let
us
hurry
to
him
at
once
to
let
him
know
that
the
truth
is
known
“He
knows
it
already
when
had
cleared
it
all
up
had
an
interview
with
him
and
finding
that
he
would
not
tell
me
the
story
told
it
to
him
on
which
he
had
to
confess
that
was
right
and
to
add
the
very
few
details
which
were
not
yet
quite
clear
to
me
your
news
of
this
morning
however
may
open
his
lips
“For
heaven’s
sake
tell
me
then
what
is
this
extraordinary
mystery
“I
will
do
so
and
will
show
you
the
steps
by
which
reached
it
and
let
me
say
to
you
first
that
which
it
is
hardest
for
me
to
say
and
for
you
to
hear
there
has
been
an
understanding
between
sir
george
burnwell
and
your
niece
mary
they
have
now
fled
together
“My
mary
impossible
“It
is
unfortunately
more
than
possible
it
is
certain
neither
you
nor
your
son
knew
the
true
character
of
this
man
when
you
admitted
him
into
your
family
circle
he
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
england
ruined
gambler
an
absolutely
desperate
villain
man
without
heart
or
conscience
your
niece
knew
nothing
of
such
men
when
he
breathed
his
vows
to
her
as
he
had
done
to
hundred
before
her
she
flattered
herself
that
she
alone
had
touched
his
heart
the
devil
knows
best
what
he
said
but
at
least
she
became
his
tool
and
was
in
the
habit
of
seeing
him
nearly
every
evening
“I
cannot
and
will
not
believe
it
cried
the
banker
with
an
ashen
face
“I
will
tell
you
then
what
occurred
in
your
house
last
night
your
niece
when
you
had
as
she
thought
gone
to
your
room
slipped
down
and
talked
to
her
lover
through
the
window
which
leads
into
the
stable
lane
his
footmarks
had
pressed
right
through
the
snow
so
long
had
he
stood
there
she
told
him
of
the
coronet
his
wicked
lust
for
gold
kindled
at
the
news
and
he
bent
her
to
his
will
have
no
doubt
that
she
loved
you
but
there
are
women
in
whom
the
love
of
lover
extinguishes
all
other
loves
and
think
that
she
must
have
been
one
she
had
hardly
listened
to
his
instructions
when
she
saw
you
coming
downstairs
on
which
she
closed
the
window
rapidly
and
told
you
about
one
of
the
servants’
escapade
with
her
wooden
legged
lover
which
was
all
perfectly
true
“Your
boy
arthur
went
to
bed
after
his
interview
with
you
but
he
slept
badly
on
account
of
his
uneasiness
about
his
club
debts
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
heard
soft
tread
pass
his
door
so
he
rose
and
looking
out
was
surprised
to
see
his
cousin
walking
very
stealthily
along
the
passage
until
she
disappeared
into
your
dressing
room
petrified
with
astonishment
the
lad
slipped
on
some
clothes
and
waited
there
in
the
dark
to
see
what
would
come
of
this
strange
affair
presently
she
emerged
from
the
room
again
and
in
the
light
of
the
passage
lamp
your
son
saw
that
she
carried
the
precious
coronet
in
her
hands
she
passed
down
the
stairs
and
he
thrilling
with
horror
ran
along
and
slipped
behind
the
curtain
near
your
door
whence
he
could
see
what
passed
in
the
hall
beneath
he
saw
her
stealthily
open
the
window
hand
out
the
coronet
to
someone
in
the
gloom
and
then
closing
it
once
more
hurry
back
to
her
room
passing
quite
close
to
where
he
stood
hid
behind
the
curtain
“As
long
as
she
was
on
the
scene
he
could
not
take
any
action
without
horrible
exposure
of
the
woman
whom
he
loved
but
the
instant
that
she
was
gone
he
realised
how
crushing
misfortune
this
would
be
for
you
and
how
all
important
it
was
to
set
it
right
he
rushed
down
just
as
he
was
in
his
bare
feet
opened
the
window
sprang
out
into
the
snow
and
ran
down
the
lane
where
he
could
see
dark
figure
in
the
moonlight
sir
george
burnwell
tried
to
get
away
but
arthur
caught
him
and
there
was
struggle
between
them
your
lad
tugging
at
one
side
of
the
coronet
and
his
opponent
at
the
other
in
the
scuffle
your
son
struck
sir
george
and
cut
him
over
the
eye
then
something
suddenly
snapped
and
your
son
finding
that
he
had
the
coronet
in
his
hands
rushed
back
closed
the
window
ascended
to
your
room
and
had
just
observed
that
the
coronet
had
been
twisted
in
the
struggle
and
was
endeavouring
to
straighten
it
when
you
appeared
upon
the
scene
“Is
it
possible
gasped
the
banker
“You
then
roused
his
anger
by
calling
him
names
at
moment
when
he
felt
that
he
had
deserved
your
warmest
thanks
he
could
not
explain
the
true
state
of
affairs
without
betraying
one
who
certainly
deserved
little
enough
consideration
at
his
hands
he
took
the
more
chivalrous
view
however
and
preserved
her
secret

“And
that
was
why
she
shrieked
and
fainted
when
she
saw
the
coronet
cried
mr
holder
“Oh
my
god
what
blind
fool
have
been
and
his
asking
to
be
allowed
to
go
out
for
five
minutes
the
dear
fellow
wanted
to
see
if
the
missing
piece
were
at
the
scene
of
the
struggle
how
cruelly
have
misjudged
him
“When
arrived
at
the
house
continued
holmes
“I
at
once
went
very
carefully
round
it
to
observe
if
there
were
any
traces
in
the
snow
which
might
help
me
knew
that
none
had
fallen
since
the
evening
before
and
also
that
there
had
been
strong
frost
to
preserve
impressions
passed
along
the
tradesmen’s
path
but
found
it
all
trampled
down
and
indistinguishable
just
beyond
it
however
at
the
far
side
of
the
kitchen
door
woman
had
stood
and
talked
with
man
whose
round
impressions
on
one
side
showed
that
he
had
wooden
leg
could
even
tell
that
they
had
been
disturbed
for
the
woman
had
run
back
swiftly
to
the
door
as
was
shown
by
the
deep
toe
and
light
heel
marks
while
wooden
leg
had
waited
little
and
then
had
gone
away
thought
at
the
time
that
this
might
be
the
maid
and
her
sweetheart
of
whom
you
had
already
spoken
to
me
and
inquiry
showed
it
was
so
passed
round
the
garden
without
seeing
anything
more
than
random
tracks
which
took
to
be
the
police
but
when
got
into
the
stable
lane
very
long
and
complex
story
was
written
in
the
snow
in
front
of
me
“There
was

was
at
once
convinced
from
what
you
had
told
me
that
the
latter
was
your
son
the
first
had
walked
both
ways
but
the
other
had
run
swiftly
and
as
his
tread
was
marked
in
places
over
the
depression
of
the
boot
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
passed
after
the
other
followed
them
up
and
found
they
led
to
the
hall
window
where
boots
had
worn
all
the
snow
away
while
waiting
then
walked
to
the
other
end
which
was
hundred
yards
or
more
down
the
lane
saw
where
boots
had
faced
round
where
the
snow
was
cut
up
as
though
there
had
been
struggle
and
finally
where
few
drops
of
blood
had
fallen
to
show
me
that
was
not
mistaken
boots
had
then
run
down
the
lane
and
another
little
smudge
of
blood
showed
that
it
was
he
who
had
been
hurt
when
he
came
to
the
highroad
at
the
other
end
found
that
the
pavement
had
been
cleared
so
there
was
an
end
to
that
clue
“On
entering
the
house
however
examined
as
you
remember
the
sill
and
framework
of
the
hall
window
with
my
lens
and
could
at
once
see
that
someone
had
passed
out
could
distinguish
the
outline
of
an
instep
where
the
wet
foot
had
been
placed
in
coming
in
was
then
beginning
to
be
able
to
form
an
opinion
as
to
what
had
occurred
man
had
waited
outside
the
window
someone
had
brought
the
gems
the
deed
had
been
overseen
by
your
son
he
had
pursued
the
thief
had
struggled
with
him
they
had
each
tugged
at
the
coronet
their
united
strength
causing
injuries
which
neither
alone
could
have
effected
he
had
returned
with
the
prize
but
had
left
fragment
in
the
grasp
of
his
opponent
so
far
was
clear
the
question
now
was
who
was
the
man
and
who
was
it
brought
him
the
coronet
“It
is
an
old
maxim
of
mine
that
when
you
have
excluded
the
impossible
whatever
remains
however
improbable
must
be
the
truth
now
knew
that
it
was
not
you
who
had
brought
it
down
so
there
only
remained
your
niece
and
the
maids
but
if
it
were
the
maids
why
should
your
son
allow
himself
to
be
accused
in
their
place
there
could
be
no
possible
reason
as
he
loved
his
cousin
however
there
was
an
excellent
explanation
why
he
should
retain
her
secret
the
more
so
as
the
secret
was
disgraceful
one
when
remembered
that
you
had
seen
her
at
that
window
and
how
she
had
fainted
on
seeing
the
coronet
again
my
conjecture
became
certainty
“And
who
could
it
be
who
was
her
confederate
lover
evidently
for
who
else
could
outweigh
the
love
and
gratitude
which
she
must
feel
to
you
knew
that
you
went
out
little
and
that
your
circle
of
friends
was
very
limited
one
but
among
them
was
sir
george
burnwell
had
heard
of
him
before
as
being
man
of
evil
reputation
among
women
it
must
have
been
he
who
wore
those
boots
and
retained
the
missing
gems
even
though
he
knew
that
arthur
had
discovered
him
he
might
still
flatter
himself
that
he
was
safe
for
the
lad
could
not
say
word
without
compromising
his
own
family
“Well

sense

what
measures

to

before

finally
at
the

of
six

all

buying

down

that

me

you
have
been
good
enough
to
draw
up

am
bound
to

occasionally
to
embellish
you
have
given
prominence
not
so
much
to
the
many
causes
célèbres
and
sensational
trials
in
which
have
figured
but
rather
to
those
incidents
which
may
have
been
trivial
in
themselves
but
which
have
given
room
for
those
faculties
of
deduction
and
of
logical
synthesis
which
have
made
my
special
province
“And
yet

smiling
“I

it
was
cold
morning
of
the
early
spring
and
we
sat
after

on

down

not

sherlock
holmes
had
been
silent
all
the
morning
dipping
continuously
into
the
advertisement
columns
of
succession
of
papers
until
at
last
having
apparently
given
up
his
search
he
had
emerged
in
no
very
sweet
temper
to
lecture
me
upon
my
literary
shortcomings
“At
the

time
he
remarked
after
pause
during
which
he
had
sat
puffing
at
his
long
pipe
and
gazing
down
into
the
fire
“you
can

this
note
had
this
morning
marks
my
zero

read
it
he
tossed
crumpled
letter
across
to
me
it
was
dated
from
montague
place
upon
the
preceding
evening
and
ran
thus
“DEAR
mr
holmes
am
very
anxious
to
consult
you
as
to
whether
should
or
should
not
accept
situation
which
has
been
offered
to
me

at

you

young
lady
asked
“Not

is
half
past
ten
now
“Yes
and
have
no
doubt
that
is
her
ring
“It
may
turn
out
to
be
of
more
interest
than
you
think
you
remember
that
the
affair
of
the
blue
carbuncle
which
appeared
to
be
mere
whim
at
first
developed
into
serious
investigation
it
may
be
so
in
this
case
also
“Well
let
us
hope
so
but
our
doubts
will
very
soon
be
solved
for
here
unless
am
much
mistaken
is
the
person
in
question
as
he
spoke
the
door
opened
and
young
lady
entered
the
room
she
was
plainly
but
neatly
dressed
with
bright
quick
face
freckled
like
plover’s
egg
and
with
the
brisk
manner
of
woman
who
has
had
her
own
way
to
make
in
the
world
“You
will
excuse
my
troubling
you
am
sure
said
she
as
my
companion
rose
to
greet
her
“but
have
had
very
strange
experience
and
as
have
no
parents
or
relations
of
any
sort
from
whom
could
ask
advice
thought
that
perhaps
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
what
should
do
“Pray
take

you
could
see
that
holmes
was
favourably
impressed
by
the
manner
and
speech
of
his
new
client
he
looked
her
over
in
his
searching
fashion
and
then
composed
himself
with
his
lids
drooping
and
his
finger
tips
together
to
listen
to
her
story
“I
have
been
governess
for
five
years

she
“in
the
family
of
colonel
spence
munro
but
two
months
ago
the
colonel
received
an
appointment
at
halifax
in
nova
scotia
and
took
his
children
over
to
america
with
him
so
that
found
myself
without
situation
advertised
and
answered
advertisements
but
without
success
at
last
the
little
money
which
had
saved
began
to
run
short
and
was
at
my
wit’s
end
as
to
what
should
do
“There
is
well
known
agency
for
governesses
in
the
west
end
called
westaway’s
and
there
used
to
call
about
once
week
in
order
to
see
whether
anything
had
turned
up
which
might
suit
me
westaway
was
the
name
of
the
founder
of
the
business
but
it
is
really
managed
by
miss
stoper
she
sits
in
her
own
little
office
and
the
ladies
who
are
seeking
employment
wait
in
an
anteroom
and
are
then
shown
in
one
by
one
when
she
consults
her
ledgers
and
sees
whether
she
has
anything
which
would
suit
them
“Well
when
called
last
week
was
shown
into
the
little
office
as
usual
but
found
that
miss
stoper
was
not
alone
prodigiously
stout
man
with
very
smiling
face
and
great
heavy
chin
which
rolled
down
in
fold
upon
fold
over
his
throat
sat
at
her
elbow
with
pair
of
glasses
on
his
nose
looking
very
earnestly
at
the
ladies
who
entered
as
came
in
he
gave
quite
jump
in
his
chair
and
turned
quickly
to
miss
stoper
‘That
will
do
said
he
‘I
could
not
ask
for
anything
better
capital
he
seemed
quite
enthusiastic
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
in
the
most
genial
fashion
he
was
such
comfortable
looking
man
that
it
was
quite
pleasure
to
look
at
him
‘You
are
looking
for
situation
miss
he
asked
‘Yes

‘As
governess
‘Yes

‘And
what
salary
do
you
ask
‘I
had
£4
month
in
my
last
place
with

spence
munro
‘Oh
tut
sweating

sweating
he
cried
throwing
his
fat
hands
out
into
the
air
like
man
who
is
in
boiling
passion
‘How
could
anyone
offer
so
pitiful
sum
to
lady
with
such
attractions
and
accomplishments
‘My
accomplishments
sir
may
be
less
than
you
imagine
said
‘A
little
french
little
german
music
and
drawing—’
‘Tut
tut
he
cried
‘This
is
all
quite
beside
the
question
the
point
is
have
you
or
have
you
not
the
bearing
and
deportment
of

it
is
in

if
you
have

you
are
not
fitted
for
the
rearing
of

who
may
some
day
play
considerable
part
in
the
history
of
the
country
but
if
you
have
why
then
how
could
any
gentleman
ask
you
to
condescend
to
accept
anything
under
the
three
figures
your
salary
with
me
madam
would
commence
at
£100
year
“You
may
imagine
mr
holmes
that
to
me
destitute
as
was
such
an
offer
seemed
almost
too
good
to
be
true
the
gentleman
however
seeing
perhaps
the
look
of
incredulity
upon
my
face
opened
pocket
book
and
took
out
note
‘It
is
also
my
custom
said
he
smiling
in
the
most
pleasant
fashion
until
his
eyes
were
just
two
little
shining
slits
amid
the
white
creases
of
his
face
‘to
advance
to
my
young
ladies
half
their
salary
beforehand
so
that
they
may
meet
any
little
expenses
of
their
journey
and
their
wardrobe
“It
seemed
to
me
that
had
never
met
so
fascinating
and
so
thoughtful
man
as
was
already
in
debt
to
my
tradesmen
the
advance
was
great
convenience
and
yet
there
was
something
unnatural
about
the
whole
transaction
which
made
me
wish
to
know
little
more
before
quite
committed
myself
‘May
ask

you

‘Hampshire

one
dear
little
romper
just
six
years
old
oh
if
you
could
see
him
killing
cockroaches
with
slipper
smack
three
gone
before
you
could
wink
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
his
eyes
into
his
head
again
“I
was
little
startled
at
the
nature
of
the
child’s
amusement
but
the
father’s
laughter
made
me
think
that
perhaps
he
was
joking
‘My
sole
duties
then
asked
‘are
to
take
charge
of
single
child
‘No
no
not
the
sole
not
the
sole
my
dear
young
lady
he
cried
‘Your
duty
would
be
as
am
sure
your
good
sense
would
suggest
to
obey
any
little
commands
my
wife
might
give
provided
always
that
they
were
such
commands
as
lady
might
with
propriety
obey
you
see
no
difficulty
heh
‘I
should
be
happy
to
make
myself
useful
‘Quite
so
in
dress
now
for
example
we
are
faddy
people
you
know
faddy
but
kind
hearted
if
you
were
asked
to
wear
any
dress
which
we
might
give
you
would
not
object
to
our
little
whim

‘No
said
considerably
astonished
at
his
words
‘Or
to
sit
here
or
sit
there
that
would
not
be
offensive
to
you
‘Oh
no
‘Or
to
cut
your
hair
quite
short
before
you
come
to
us
“I
could
hardly
believe
my
ears
as
you
may
observe
mr
holmes
my
hair
is
somewhat
luxuriant
and
of
rather
peculiar
tint
of
chestnut
it
has
been
considered
artistic
could
not
dream
of
sacrificing
it
in
this
offhand
fashion
‘I
am
afraid
that
is
quite
impossible
said
he
had
been
watching
me
eagerly
out
of
his
small
eyes
and
could
see
shadow
pass
over
his
face
as
spoke
‘I
am
afraid
that
it
is
quite
essential
said
he
‘It
is
little
fancy
of
my
wife’s
and
ladies’
fancies
you
know
madam
ladies’
fancies
must
be
consulted
and
so
you
won’t
cut
your
hair
‘No
sir
really
could
not
answered
firmly
‘Ah
very
well
then
that
quite
settles
the
matter
it
is
pity
because
in
other
respects
you
would
really
have
done
very
nicely
in
that
case
miss
stoper
had
best
inspect
few
more
of
your
young
ladies
“The
manageress
had
sat
all
this
while
busy
with
her
papers
without
word
to
either
of
us
but
she
glanced
at
me
now
with
so
much
annoyance
upon
her
face
that
could
not
help
suspecting
that
she
had
lost
handsome
commission
through
my
refusal
‘Do
you
desire
your
name
to
be
kept
upon
the
books
she
asked
‘If
you
please
miss
stoper
‘Well
really
it
seems
rather
useless
since
you
refuse
the
most
excellent
offers
in
this
fashion
said
she
sharply
‘You
can
hardly
expect
us
to
exert
ourselves
to
find
another
such
opening

you

you

struck

upon
the

was
shown
out
by

“Well
mr
holmes
when
got
back
to
my
lodgings
and
found
little
enough
in
the
cupboard
and
two
or
three
bills
upon
the
table
began
to
ask
myself
whether
had
not
done
very
foolish
thing
after
all
if
these
people
had
strange
fads
and
expected
obedience
on
the
most
extraordinary
matters
they
were
at
least
ready
to
pay
for
their
eccentricity
very
few

in

are
getting
£100

besides
what
use
was
my

to
me
many
people
are
improved
by
wearing
it
short

perhaps
should
be
among
the
number
next

was
inclined
to
think
that
had
made
mistake
and
by
the
day
after
was
sure
of
it
had
almost
overcome
my
pride
so
far
as
to
go
back
to
the
agency
and
inquire
whether
the
place
was
still
open
when
received
this
letter
from
the

it

will
read
it
to
you

you

reconsidered
your
decision
my

is
very
anxious
that

should
come

she
has
been
much
attracted
by
my
description

give
£30

£120

so
as
to
recompense
you

may
cause
you
they
are
not

exacting

my

is
fond
of
particular
shade

would
like
you
to
wear
such

indoors
in

you
need
not

go
to
the

of
purchasing
one

we
have
one
belonging

fit

it
is
no

pity
especially
as
could
not
help
remarking
its
beauty
during
our
short
interview

am
afraid
that
must
remain
firm
upon
this
point

only
hope
that
the
increased

may
recompense
you
for
the
loss

“That
is
the
letter
which
have
just
received
mr
holmes
and
my
mind
is
made
up
that
will
accept
it
thought
however
that
before
taking
the
final
step
should
like
to
submit
the
whole
matter
to
your
consideration
“Well
miss
hunter
if
your
mind
is
made
up
that
settles
the
question
said
holmes
smiling
“But
you
would
not
advise
me
to
refuse
“I
confess
that
it
is
not
the
situation
which
should
like
to
see
sister
of
mine
apply
for
“What
is
the
meaning
of
it
all
mr
holmes
“Ah
have
no
data
cannot
tell
perhaps
you
have
yourself
formed
some
opinion
“Well
there
seems
to
me
to
be
only
one
possible
solution
mr
rucastle
seemed
to
be
very
kind
good
natured
man
is
it
not
possible
that
his
wife
is
lunatic
that
he
desires
to
keep
the
matter
quiet
for
fear
she
should
be
taken
to
an
asylum
and
that
he
humours
her
fancies
in
every
way
in
order
to
prevent
an
outbreak
“That
is
possible
solution
in
fact
as
matters
stand
it
is
the
most
probable
one
but
in
any
case
it
does
not
seem
to
be
nice
household
for
young
lady
“But
the
money
mr
holmes
the
money
“Well
yes
of
course
the
pay
is
good
too
good
that
is
what
makes
me
uneasy
why
should
they
give
you
£120
year
when
they
could
have
their
pick
for
£40
there
must
be
some
strong
reason
behind
“I
thought
that
if
told
you
the
circumstances
you
would
understand
afterwards
if
wanted
your
help
should
feel
so
much
stronger
if
felt
that
you
were
at
the
back
of
me
“Oh
you
may
carry
that
feeling
away
with
you
assure
you
that
your
little
problem
promises
to
be
the
most
interesting
which
has
come
my
way
for
some
months
there
is
something
distinctly
novel
about
some
of
the
features
if
you
should
find
yourself
in
doubt
or
in
danger—”
“Danger
what
danger
do
you
foresee
holmes
shook
his
head
gravely
“It
would
cease
to
be
danger
if
we
could
define
it
said
he
“But
at
any
time
day
or
night
telegram
would
bring
me
down
to
your
help
“That
is
enough
she
rose
briskly
from
her
chair
with
the
anxiety
all
swept
from
her
face
“I
shall
go
down
to
hampshire
quite
easy
in
my
mind
now
shall
write
to
mr
rucastle
at
once
sacrifice
my
poor
hair
to
night
and
start
for
winchester
to
morrow
with
few
grateful
words
to
holmes
she
bade
us
both
good
night
and
bustled
off
upon
her
way
“At
least
said
as
we
heard
her
quick
firm
steps
descending
the
stairs
“she
seems
to
be
young
lady
who
is
very
well
able
to
take
care
of
herself
“And
she
would
need
to
be
said
holmes
gravely
“I
am
much
mistaken
if
we
do
not
hear
from
her
before
many
days
are
past
it
was
not
very
long
before
my
friend’s
prediction
was
fulfilled
fortnight
went
by
during
which
frequently
found
my
thoughts
turning
in
her
direction
and
wondering
what
strange
side
alley
of
human
experience
this
lonely
woman
had
strayed
into
the
unusual
salary
the
curious
conditions
the
light
duties
all
pointed
to
something
abnormal
though
whether
fad
or
plot
or
whether
the
man
were
philanthropist
or
villain
it
was
quite
beyond
my
powers
to
determine
as
to
holmes
observed
that
he
sat
frequently
for
half
an
hour
on
end
with
knitted
brows
and
an
abstracted
air
but
he
swept
the
matter
away
with
wave
of
his
hand
when
mentioned
it
“Data
data
he
cried
impatiently
“I
can’t
make
bricks
without
clay
and
yet
he
would
always
wind
up
by
muttering
that
no
sister
of
his
should
ever
have
accepted
such
situation
the
telegram
which
we
eventually
received
came
late
one
night
just
as
was
thinking
of
turning
in
and
holmes
was
settling
down
to
one
of
those
all
night
chemical
researches
which
he
frequently
indulged
in
when
would
leave
him
stooping
over
retort
and
test
tube
at
night
and
find
him
in
the
same
position
when
came
down
to
breakfast
in
the
morning
he
opened
the
yellow
envelope
and
then
glancing
at
the
message
threw
it
across
to
me
“Just
look
up
the
trains
in
bradshaw
said
he
and
turned
back
to
his
chemical
studies
the
summons
was
brief
and
urgent
one
“Please
be
at
the
black
swan
hotel
at
winchester
at
midday
to
morrow
it
said
“Do
come
am
at
my
wit’s
end
“HUNTER
“Will
you
come
with
me
asked
holmes
glancing
up
“I
should
wish
to
“Just
look
it
up
then
“There
is
train
at
half
past
nine
said
glancing
over
my
bradshaw
“It
is
due
at
winchester
at
11
30
“That
will
do
very
nicely
then
perhaps
had
better
postpone
my
analysis
of
the
acetones
as
we
may
need
to
be
at
our
best
in
the
morning
by
eleven
o’clock
the
next
day
we
were
well
upon
our
way
to
the
old
english
capital
holmes
had
been
buried
in
the
morning
papers
all
the
way
down
but
after
we
had
passed
the
hampshire
border
he
threw
them
down
and
began
to
admire
the
scenery
it
was
an
ideal
spring
day
light
blue
sky
flecked
with
little
fleecy
white
clouds
drifting
across
from
west
to
east
the
sun
was
shining
very
brightly
and
yet
there
was
an
exhilarating
nip
in
the
air
which
set
an
edge
to
man’s
energy
all
over
the
countryside
away
to
the
rolling
hills
around
aldershot
the
little
red
and
grey
roofs
of
the
farm
steadings
peeped
out
from
amid
the
light
green
of
the
new
foliage

“Are
they
not
fresh
and
beautiful
cried
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
man
fresh
from
the
fogs
of
baker
street
but
holmes
shook
his
head
gravely
“Do
you
know
watson
said
he
“that
it
is
one
of
the
curses
of
mind
with
turn
like
mine
that
must
look
at
everything
with
reference
to
my
own
special
subject
you
look
at
these
scattered
houses
and
you
are
impressed
by
their
beauty
look
at
them
and
the
only
thought
which
comes
to
me
is
feeling
of
their
isolation
and
of
the
impunity
with
which
crime
may
be
committed
there
“Good
heavens
cried
“Who
would
associate
crime
with
these
dear
old
homesteads
“They
always
fill
me
with
certain
horror
it
is
my
belief
watson
founded
upon
my
experience
that
the
lowest
and
vilest
alleys
in
london
do
not
present
more
dreadful
record
of
sin
than
does
the
smiling
and
beautiful
countryside
“You
horrify
me
“But
the
reason
is
very
obvious
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
can
do
in
the
town
what
the
law
cannot
accomplish
there
is
no
lane
so
vile
that
the
scream
of
tortured
child
or
the
thud
of
drunkard’s
blow
does
not
beget
sympathy
and
indignation
among
the
neighbours
and
then
the
whole
machinery
of
justice
is
ever
so
close
that
word
of
complaint
can
set
it
going
and
there
is
but
step
between
the
crime
and
the
dock
but
look
at
these
lonely
houses
each
in
its
own
fields
filled
for
the
most
part
with
poor
ignorant
folk
who
know
little
of
the
law
think
of
the
deeds
of
hellish
cruelty
the
hidden
wickedness
which
may
go
on
year
in
year
out
in
such
places
and
none
the
wiser
had
this
lady
who
appeals
to
us
for
help
gone
to
live
in
winchester
should
never
have
had
fear
for
her
it
is
the
five
miles
of
country
which
makes
the
danger
still
it
is
clear
that
she
is
not
personally
threatened
“No
if
she
can
come
to
winchester
to
meet
us
she
can
get
away
“Quite
so
she
has
her
freedom
“What
can
be
the
matter
then
can
you
suggest
no
explanation
“I
have
devised
seven
separate
explanations
each
of
which
would
cover
the
facts
as
far
as
we
know
them
but
which
of
these
is
correct
can
only
be
determined
by
the
fresh
information
which
we
shall
no
doubt
find
waiting
for
us
well
there
is
the
tower
of
the
cathedral
and
we
shall
soon
learn
all
that
miss
hunter
has
to
tell
the
black
swan
is
an
inn
of
repute
in
the
high
street
at
no
distance
from
the
station
and
there
we
found
the
young
lady
waiting
for
us
she
had
engaged
sitting
room
and
our
lunch
awaited
us
upon
the
table
“I
am
so
delighted
that
you
have
come
she
said
earnestly
“It
is
so
very
kind
of
you
both
but
indeed
do
not
know
what
should
do
your
advice
will
be
altogether
invaluable
to
me
“Pray
tell
us
what
has
happened
to
you
“I
will
do
so
and
must
be
quick
for
have
promised
mr
rucastle
to
be
back
before
three
got
his
leave
to
come
into
town
this
morning
though
he
little
knew
for
what
purpose
“Let
us
have
everything
in
its
due
order
holmes
thrust
his
long
thin
legs
out
towards
the
fire
and
composed
himself
to
listen
“In
the
first
place
may
say
that
have
met
on
the
whole
with
no
actual
ill
treatment
from
mr
and
mrs
rucastle
it
is
only
fair
to
them
to
say
that
but
cannot
understand
them
and
am
not
easy
in
my
mind
about
them
“What
can
you
not
understand
“Their
reasons
for
their
conduct
but
you
shall
have
it
all
just
as
it
occurred
when
came
down
mr
rucastle
met
me
here
and
drove
me
in
his
dog
cart
to
the
copper
beeches
it
is
as
he
said
beautifully
situated
but
it
is
not
beautiful
in
itself
for
it
is
large
square
block
of
house
whitewashed
but
all
stained
and
streaked
with
damp
and
bad
weather
there
are
grounds
round
it
woods
on
three
sides
and
on
the
fourth
field
which
slopes
down
to
the
southampton
highroad
which
curves
past
about
hundred
yards
from
the
front
door
this
ground
in
front
belongs
to
the
house
but
the
woods
all
round
are
part
of
lord
southerton’s
preserves
clump
of
copper
beeches
immediately
in
front
of
the
hall
door
has
given
its
name
to
the
place
“I
was
driven
over
by
my
employer
who
was
as
amiable
as
ever
and
was
introduced
by
him
that
evening
to
his
wife
and
the
child
there
was
no
truth
mr
holmes
in
the
conjecture
which
seemed
to
us
to
be
probable
in
your
rooms
at
baker
street
mrs
rucastle
is
not
mad
found
her
to
be
silent
pale
faced
woman
much
younger
than
her
husband
not
more
than
thirty
should
think
while
he
can
hardly
be
less
than
forty
five
from
their
conversation
have
gathered
that
they
have
been
married
about
seven
years
that
he
was
widower
and
that
his
only
child
by
the
first
wife
was
the
daughter
who
has
gone
to
philadelphia
mr
rucastle
told
me
in
private
that
the
reason
why
she
had
left
them
was
that
she
had
an
unreasoning
aversion
to
her
stepmother
as
the
daughter
could
not
have
been
less
than
twenty
can
quite
imagine
that
her
position
must
have
been
uncomfortable
with
her
father’s
young
wife
“Mrs
rucastle
seemed
to
me
to
be
colourless
in
mind
as
well
as
in
feature
she
impressed
me
neither
favourably
nor
the
reverse
she
was
nonentity
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
was
passionately
devoted
both
to
her
husband
and
to
her
little
son
her
light
grey
eyes
wandered
continually
from
one
to
the
other
noting
every
little
want
and
forestalling
it
if
possible
he
was
kind
to
her
also
in
his
bluff
boisterous
fashion
and
on
the
whole
they
seemed
to
be
happy
couple
and
yet
she
had
some
secret
sorrow
this
woman
she
would
often
be
lost
in
deep
thought
with
the
saddest
look
upon
her
face
more
than
once
have
surprised
her
in
tears
have
thought
sometimes
that
it
was
the
disposition
of
her
child
which
weighed
upon
her
mind
for
have
never
met
so
utterly
spoiled
and
so
ill
natured
little
creature
he
is
small
for
his
age
with
head
which
is
quite
disproportionately
large
his
whole
life
appears
to
be
spent
in
an
alternation
between
savage
fits
of
passion
and
gloomy
intervals
of
sulking
giving
pain
to
any
creature
weaker
than
himself
seems
to
be
his
one
idea
of
amusement
and
he
shows
quite
remarkable
talent
in
planning
the
capture
of
mice
little
birds
and
insects
but
would
rather
not
talk
about
the
creature
mr
holmes
and
indeed
he
has
little
to
do
with
my
story
“I
am
glad
of
all
details
remarked
my
friend
“whether
they
seem
to
you
to
be
relevant
or
not
“I
shall
try
not
to
miss
anything
of
importance
the
one
unpleasant
thing
about
the
house
which
struck
me
at
once
was
the
appearance
and
conduct
of
the
servants
there
are
only
two
man
and
his
wife
toller
for
that
is
his
name
is
rough
uncouth
man
with
grizzled
hair
and
whiskers
and
perpetual
smell
of
drink
twice
since
have
been
with
them
he
has
been
quite
drunk
and
yet
mr
rucastle
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
it
his
wife
is
very
tall
and
strong
woman
with
sour
face
as
silent
as
mrs
rucastle
and
much
less
amiable
they
are
most
unpleasant
couple
but
fortunately
spend
most
of
my
time
in
the
nursery
and
my
own
room
which
are
next
to
each
other
in
one
corner
of
the
building
“For
two
days
after
my
arrival
at
the
copper
beeches
my
life
was
very
quiet
on
the
third
mrs
rucastle
came
down
just
after
breakfast
and
whispered
something
to
her
husband
‘Oh
yes
said
he
turning
to
me
‘we
are
very
much
obliged
to
you
miss
hunter
for
falling
in
with
our
whims
so
far
as
to
cut
your
hair
assure
you
that
it
has
not
detracted
in
the
tiniest
iota
from
your
appearance
we
shall
now
see
how
the
electric
blue
dress
will
become
you
will
find
it
laid
out
upon
the
bed
in
your
room
and
if
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
put
it
on
we
should
both
be
extremely
obliged
“The
dress
which
found
waiting
for
me
was
of
peculiar
shade
of
blue
it
was
of
excellent
material
sort
of
beige
but
it
bore
unmistakable
signs
of
having
been
worn
before
it
could
not
have
been
better
fit
if
had
been
measured
for
it
both
mr
and
mrs
rucastle
expressed
delight
at
the
look
of
it
which
seemed
quite
exaggerated
in
its
vehemence
they
were
waiting
for
me
in
the
drawing
room
which
is
very
large
room
stretching
along
the
entire
front
of
the
house
with
three
long
windows
reaching
down
to
the
floor
chair
had
been
placed
close
to
the
central
window
with
its
back
turned
towards
it
in
this
was
asked
to
sit
and
then
mr
rucastle
walking
up
and
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
began
to
tell
me
series
of
the
funniest
stories
that
have
ever
listened
to
you
cannot
imagine
how
comical
he
was
and
laughed
until
was
quite
weary
mrs
rucastle
however
who
has
evidently
no
sense
of
humour
never
so
much
as
smiled
but
sat
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
sad
anxious
look
upon
her
face
after
an
hour
or
so
mr
rucastle
suddenly
remarked
that
it
was
time
to
commence
the
duties
of
the
day
and
that
might
change
my
dress
and
go
to
little
edward
in
the
nursery

“Two
days
later
this
same
performance
was
gone
through
under
exactly
similar
circumstances
again
changed
my
dress
again
sat
in
the
window
and
again
laughed
very
heartily
at
the
funny
stories
of
which
my
employer
had
an
immense
répertoire
and
which
he
told
inimitably
then
he
handed
me
yellow
backed
novel
and
moving
my
chair
little
sideways
that
my
own
shadow
might
not
fall
upon
the
page
he
begged
me
to
read
aloud
to
him
read
for
about
ten
minutes
beginning
in
the
heart
of
chapter
and
then
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
sentence
he
ordered
me
to
cease
and
to
change
my
dress
“You
can
easily
imagine
mr
holmes
how
curious
became
as
to
what
the
meaning
of
this
extraordinary
performance
could
possibly
be
they
were
always
very
careful
observed
to
turn
my
face
away
from
the
window
so
that
became
consumed
with
the
desire
to
see
what
was
going
on
behind
my
back
at
first
it
seemed
to
be
impossible
but
soon
devised
means
my
hand
mirror
had
been
broken
so
happy
thought
seized
me
and
concealed
piece
of
the
glass
in
my
handkerchief
on
the
next
occasion
in
the
midst
of
my
laughter
put
my
handkerchief
up
to
my
eyes
and
was
able
with
little
management
to
see
all
that
there
was
behind
me
confess
that
was
disappointed
there
was
nothing
at
least
that
was
my
first
impression
at
the
second
glance
however
perceived
that
there
was
man
standing
in
the
southampton
road
small
bearded
man
in
grey
suit
who
seemed
to
be
looking
in
my
direction
the
road
is
an
important
highway
and
there
are
usually
people
there
this
man
however
was
leaning
against
the
railings
which
bordered
our
field
and
was
looking
earnestly
up
lowered
my
handkerchief
and
glanced
at
mrs
rucastle
to
find
her
eyes
fixed
upon
me
with
most
searching
gaze
she
said
nothing
but
am
convinced
that
she
had
divined
that
had
mirror
in
my
hand
and
had
seen
what
was
behind
me
she
rose
at
once
‘Jephro
said
she
‘there
is
an
impertinent
fellow
upon
the
road
there
who
stares
up
at
miss
hunter
‘No
friend
of
yours
miss
hunter
he
asked
‘No
know
no
one
in
these
parts
‘Dear
me
how
very
impertinent
kindly
turn
round
and
motion
to
him
to
go
away
‘Surely
it
would
be
better
to
take
no
notice
‘No
no
we
should
have
him
loitering
here
always
kindly
turn
round
and
wave
him
away
like
that
“I
did
as
was
told
and
at
the
same
instant
mrs
rucastle
drew
down
the
blind
that
was
week
ago
and
from
that
time
have
not
sat
again
in
the
window
nor
have
worn
the
blue
dress
nor
seen
the
man
in
the
road
“Pray
continue
said
holmes
“Your
narrative
promises
to
be
most
interesting
one
“You
will
find
it
rather
disconnected
fear
and
there
may
prove
to
be
little
relation
between
the
different
incidents
of
which
speak
on
the
very
first
day
that
was
at
the
copper
beeches
mr
rucastle
took
me
to
small
outhouse
which
stands
near
the
kitchen
door
as
we
approached
it
heard
the
sharp
rattling
of
chain
and
the
sound
as
of
large
animal
moving
about
‘Look
in
here
said
mr
rucastle
showing
me
slit
between
two
planks
‘Is
he
not
beauty
“I
looked
through
and
was
conscious
of
two
glowing
eyes
and
of
vague
figure
huddled
up
in
the
darkness
‘Don’t
be
frightened
said
my
employer
laughing
at
the
start
which
had
given
‘It’s
only
carlo
my
mastiff
call
him
mine
but
really
old
toller
my
groom
is
the
only
man
who
can
do
anything
with
him
we
feed
him
once
day
and
not
too
much
then
so
that
he
is
always
as
keen
as
mustard
toller
lets
him
loose
every
night
and
god
help
the
trespasser
whom
he
lays
his
fangs
upon
for
goodness’
sake
don’t
you
ever
on
any
pretext
set
your
foot
over
the
threshold
at
night
for
it’s
as
much
as
your
life
is
worth
“The
warning
was
no
idle
one
for
two
nights
later
happened
to
look
out
of
my
bedroom
window
about
two
o’clock
in
the
morning
it
was
beautiful
moonlight
night
and
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
was
silvered
over
and
almost
as
bright
as
day
was
standing
rapt
in
the
peaceful
beauty
of
the
scene
when
was
aware
that
something
was
moving
under
the
shadow
of
the
copper
beeches
as
it
emerged
into
the
moonshine
saw
what
it
was
it
was
giant
dog
as
large
as
calf
tawny
tinted
with
hanging
jowl
black
muzzle
and
huge
projecting
bones
it
walked
slowly
across
the
lawn
and
vanished
into
the
shadow
upon
the
other
side
that
dreadful
sentinel
sent
chill
to
my
heart
which
do
not
think
that
any
burglar
could
have
done
“And
now
have
very
strange
experience
to
tell
you
had
as
you
know
cut
off
my
hair
in
london
and
had
placed
it
in
great
coil
at
the
bottom
of
my
trunk
one
evening
after
the
child
was
in
bed
began
to
amuse
myself
by
examining
the
furniture
of
my
room
and
by
rearranging
my
own
little
things
there
was
an
old
chest
of
drawers
in
the
room
the
two
upper
ones
empty
and
open
the
lower
one
locked
had
filled
the
first
two
with
my
linen
and
as
had
still
much
to
pack
away
was
naturally
annoyed
at
not
having
the
use
of
the
third
drawer
it
struck
me
that
it
might
have
been
fastened
by
mere
oversight
so
took
out
my
bunch
of
keys
and
tried
to
open
it
the
very
first
key
fitted
to
perfection
and
drew
the
drawer
open
there
was
only
one
thing
in
it
but
am
sure
that
you
would
never
guess
what
it
was
it
was
my
coil
of
hair
“I
took
it
up
and
examined
it
was
of
the
same
peculiar
tint
and
the
same
thickness
but
then
the
impossibility
of
the
thing
obtruded
itself
upon
me
how
could
my
hair
have
been
locked
in
the
drawer
with
trembling
hands
undid
my
trunk
turned
out
the
contents
and
drew
from
the
bottom
my
own
hair
laid
the
two
tresses
together
and
assure
you
that
they
were
identical
was
it
not
extraordinary
puzzle
as
would
could
make
nothing
at
all
of
what
it
meant
returned
the
strange
hair
to
the
drawer
and
said
nothing
of
the
matter
to
the
rucastles
as
felt
that
had
put
myself
in
the
wrong
by
opening
drawer
which
they
had
locked
“I
am
naturally
observant
as
you
may
have
remarked
mr
holmes
and
soon
had
pretty
good
plan
of
the
whole
house
in
my
head
there
was
one
wing
however
which
appeared
not
to
be
inhabited
at
all
door
which
faced
that
which
led
into
the
quarters
of
the
tollers
opened
into
this
suite
but
it
was
invariably
locked
one
day
however
as
ascended
the
stair
met
mr
rucastle
coming
out
through
this
door
his
keys
in
his
hand
and
look
on
his
face
which
made
him
very
different
person
to
the
round
jovial
man
to
whom
was
accustomed
his
cheeks
were
red
his
brow
was
all
crinkled
with
anger
and
the
veins
stood
out
at
his
temples
with
passion
he
locked
the
door
and
hurried
past
me
without
word
or
look
“This
aroused
my
curiosity
so
when
went
out
for
walk
in
the
grounds
with
my
charge
strolled
round
to
the
side
from
which
could
see
the
windows
of
this
part
of
the
house
there
were
four
of
them
in
row
three
of
which
were
simply
dirty
while
the
fourth
was
shuttered
up
they
were
evidently
all
deserted
as
strolled
up
and
down
glancing
at
them
occasionally
mr
rucastle
came
out
to
me
looking
as
merry
and
jovial
as
ever
‘Ah
said
he
‘you
must
not
think
me
rude
if
passed
you
without
word
my
dear
young
lady
was
preoccupied
with
business
matters
“I
assured
him
that
was
not
offended
‘By
the
way
said
‘you
seem
to
have
quite
suite
of
spare
rooms
up
there
and
one
of
them
has
the
shutters
up
“He
looked
surprised
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
little
startled
at
my
remark
‘Photography
is
one
of
my
hobbies
said
he
‘I
have
made
my
dark
room
up
there
but
dear
me
what
an
observant
young
lady
we
have
come
upon
who
would
have
believed
it
who
would
have
ever
believed
it
he
spoke
in
jesting
tone
but
there
was
no
jest
in
his
eyes
as
he
looked
at
me
read
suspicion
there
and
annoyance
but
no
jest
“Well
mr
holmes
from
the
moment
that
understood
that
there
was
something
about
that
suite
of
rooms
which
was
not
to
know
was
all
on
fire
to
go
over
them
it
was
not
mere
curiosity
though
have
my
share
of
that
it
was
more
feeling
of
duty
feeling
that
some
good
might
come
from
my
penetrating
to
this
place
they
talk
of
woman’s
instinct
perhaps
it
was
woman’s
instinct
which
gave
me
that
feeling
at
any
rate
it
was
there
and
was
keenly
on
the
lookout
for
any
chance
to
pass
the
forbidden
door
“It
was
only
yesterday
that
the
chance
came
may
tell
you
that
besides
mr
rucastle
both
toller
and
his
wife
find
something
to
do
in
these
deserted
rooms
and
once
saw
him
carrying
large
black
linen
bag
with
him
through
the
door
recently
he
has
been
drinking
hard
and
yesterday
evening
he
was
very
drunk
and
when
came
upstairs
there
was
the
key
in
the
door
have
no
doubt
at
all
that
he
had
left
it
there
mr
and
mrs
rucastle
were
both
downstairs
and
the
child
was
with
them
so
that
had
an
admirable
opportunity
turned
the
key
gently
in
the
lock
opened
the
door
and
slipped

“There
was
little
passage
in
front
of
me
unpapered
and
uncarpeted
which
turned
at
right
angle
at
the
farther
end
round
this
corner
were
three
doors
in
line
the
first
and
third
of
which
were
open
they
each
led
into
an
empty
room
dusty
and
cheerless
with
two
windows
in
the
one
and
one
in
the
other
so
thick
with
dirt
that
the
evening
light
glimmered
dimly
through
them
the
centre
door
was
closed
and
across
the
outside
of
it
had
been
fastened
one
of
the
broad
bars
of
an
iron
bed
padlocked
at
one
end
to
ring
in
the
wall
and
fastened
at
the
other
with
stout
cord
the
door
itself
was
locked
as
well
and
the
key
was
not
there
this
barricaded
door
corresponded
clearly
with
the
shuttered
window
outside
and
yet
could
see
by
the
glimmer
from
beneath
it
that
the
room
was
not
in
darkness
evidently
there
was
skylight
which
let
in
light
from
above
as
stood
in
the
passage
gazing
at
the
sinister
door
and
wondering
what
secret
it
might
veil
suddenly
heard
the
sound
of
steps
within
the
room
and
saw
shadow
pass
backward
and
forward
against
the
little
slit
of
dim
light
which
shone
out
from
under
the
door
mad
unreasoning
terror
rose
up
in
me
at
the
sight
mr
holmes
my
overstrung
nerves
failed
me
suddenly
and
turned
and
ran
as
though
some
dreadful
hand
were
behind
me
clutching
at
the
skirt
of
my
dress
rushed
down
the
passage
through
the
door
and
straight
into
the
arms
of
mr
rucastle
who
was
waiting
outside
‘So
said
he
smiling
‘it
was
you
then
thought
that
it
must
be
when
saw
the
door
open
‘Oh
am
so
frightened
panted
‘My
dear
young
lady
my
dear
young
lady
’—you
cannot
think
how
caressing
and
soothing
his
manner
was—‘and
what
has
frightened
you
my
dear
young
lady
“But
his
voice
was
just
little
too
coaxing
he
overdid
it
was
keenly
on
my
guard
against
him
‘I
was
foolish
enough
to
go
into
the
empty
wing
answered
‘But
it
is
so
lonely
and
eerie
in
this
dim
light
that
was
frightened
and
ran
out
again
oh
it
is
so
dreadfully
still
in
there
‘Only
that
said
he
looking
at
me
keenly
‘Why
what
did
you
think
asked
‘Why
do
you
think
that
lock
this
door
‘I
am
sure
that
do
not
know
‘It
is
to
keep
people
out
who
have
no
business
there
do
you
see
he
was
still
smiling
in
the
most
amiable
manner
‘I
am
sure
if
had
known—’
‘Well
then
you
know
now
and
if
you
ever
put
your
foot
over
that
threshold
again’—here
in
an
instant
the
smile
hardened
into
grin
of
rage
and
he
glared
down
at
me
with
the
face
of
demon—‘I’ll
throw
you
to
the
mastiff
“I
was
so
terrified
that
do
not
know
what
did
suppose
that
must
have
rushed
past
him
into
my
room
remember
nothing
until
found
myself
lying
on
my
bed
trembling
all
over
then
thought
of
you
mr
holmes
could
not
live
there
longer
without
some
advice
was
frightened
of
the
house
of
the
man
of
the
woman
of
the
servants
even
of
the
child
they
were
all
horrible
to
me
if
could
only
bring
you
down
all
would
be
well
of
course
might
have
fled
from
the
house
but
my
curiosity
was
almost
as
strong
as
my
fears
my
mind
was
soon
made
up
would
send
you
wire
put
on
my
hat
and
cloak
went
down
to
the
office
which
is
about
half
mile
from
the
house
and
then
returned
feeling
very
much
easier
horrible
doubt
came
into
my
mind
as
approached
the
door
lest
the
dog
might
be
loose
but
remembered
that
toller
had
drunk
himself
into
state
of
insensibility
that
evening
and
knew
that
he
was
the
only
one
in
the
household
who
had
any
influence
with
the
savage
creature
or
who
would
venture
to
set
him
free
slipped
in
safety
and
lay
awake
half
the
night
in
my
joy
at
the
thought
of
seeing
you
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
leave
to
come
into
winchester
this
morning
but
must
be
back
before
three
o’clock
for
mr
and
mrs
rucastle
are
going
on
visit
and
will
be
away
all
the
evening
so
that
must
look
after
the
child
now
have
told
you
all
my
adventures
mr
holmes
and
should
be
very
glad
if
you
could
tell
me
what
it
all
means
and
above
all
what
should
do
holmes
and
had
listened
spellbound
to
this
extraordinary
story
my
friend
rose
now
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
an
expression
of
the
most
profound
gravity
upon
his
face
“Is
toller
still
drunk
he
asked
“Yes
heard
his
wife
tell
mrs
rucastle
that
she
could
do
nothing
with
him
“That
is
well
and
the
rucastles
go
out
to
night
“Yes
“Is
there
cellar
with
good
strong
lock
“Yes
the
wine
cellar
“You
seem
to
me
to
have
acted
all
through
this
matter
like
very
brave
and
sensible
girl
miss
hunter
do
you
think
that
you
could
perform
one
more
feat
should
not
ask
it
of
you
if
did
not
think
you
quite
exceptional
woman
“I
will
try
what
is
it
“We
shall
be
at
the
copper
beeches
by
seven
o’clock
my
friend
and
the
rucastles
will
be
gone
by
that
time
and
toller
will
we
hope
be
incapable
there
only
remains
mrs
toller
who
might
give
the
alarm
if
you
could
send
her
into
the
cellar
on
some
errand
and
then
turn
the
key
upon
her
you
would
facilitate
matters
immensely
“I
will
do
it
“Excellent
we
shall
then
look
thoroughly
into
the
affair
of
course
there
is
only
one
feasible
explanation
you
have
been
brought
there
to
personate
someone
and
the
real
person
is
imprisoned
in
this
chamber
that
is
obvious
as
to
who
this
prisoner
is
have
no
doubt
that
it
is
the
daughter
miss
alice
rucastle
if
remember
right
who
was
said
to
have
gone
to
america
you
were
chosen
doubtless
as
resembling
her
in
height
figure
and
the
colour
of
your
hair
hers
had
been
cut
off
very
possibly
in
some
illness
through
which
she
has
passed
and
so
of
course
yours
had
to
be
sacrificed
also
by
curious
chance
you
came
upon
her
tresses
the
man
in
the
road
was
undoubtedly
some
friend
of
hers
possibly
her
fiancé—and
no
doubt
as
you
wore
the
girl’s
dress
and
were
so
like
her
he
was
convinced
from
your
laughter
whenever
he
saw
you
and
afterwards
from
your
gesture
that
miss
rucastle
was
perfectly
happy
and
that
she
no
longer
desired
his
attentions
the
dog
is
let
loose
at
night
to
prevent
him
from
endeavouring
to
communicate
with
her
so
much
is
fairly
clear
the
most
serious
point
in
the
case
is
the
disposition
of
the
child
“What
on
earth
has
that
to
do
with
it
ejaculated
“My
dear
watson
you
as
medical
man
are
continually
gaining
light
as
to
the
tendencies
of
child
by
the
study
of
the
parents
don’t
you
see
that
the
converse
is
equally
valid
have
frequently
gained
my
first
real
insight
into
the
character
of
parents
by
studying
their
children
this
child’s
disposition
is
abnormally
cruel
merely
for
cruelty’s
sake
and
whether
he
derives
this
from
his
smiling
father
as
should
suspect
or
from
his
mother
it
bodes
evil
for
the
poor
girl
who
is
in
their
power
“I
am
sure
that
you
are
right
mr
holmes
cried
our
client
“A
thousand
things
come
back
to
me
which
make
me
certain
that
you
have
hit
it
oh
let
us
lose
not
an
instant
in
bringing
help
to
this
poor
creature
“We
must
be
circumspect
for
we
are
dealing
with
very
cunning
man
we
can
do
nothing
until
seven
o’clock
at
that
hour
we
shall
be
with
you
and
it
will
not
be
long
before
we
solve
the
mystery
we
were
as
good
as
our
word
for
it
was
just
seven
when
we
reached
the
copper
beeches
having
put
up
our
trap
at
wayside
public
house
the
group
of
trees
with
their
dark
leaves
shining
like
burnished
metal
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
were
sufficient
to
mark
the
house
even
had
miss
hunter
not
been
standing
smiling
on
the
door
step
“Have
you
managed
it
asked
holmes
loud
thudding
noise
came
from
somewhere
downstairs
“That
is
mrs
toller
in
the
cellar
said
she
“Her
husband
lies
snoring
on
the
kitchen
rug
here
are
his
keys
which
are
the
duplicates
of
mr
rucastle’s
“You
have
done
well
indeed
cried
holmes
with
enthusiasm
“Now
lead
the
way
and
we
shall
soon
see
the
end
of
this
black
business
we
passed
up
the
stair
unlocked
the
door
followed
on
down
passage
and
found
ourselves
in
front
of
the
barricade
which
miss
hunter
had
described
holmes
cut
the
cord
and
removed
the
transverse
bar
then
he
tried
the
various
keys
in
the
lock
but
without
success
no
sound
came
from
within
and
at
the
silence
holmes’
face
clouded
over
“I
trust
that
we
are
not
too
late
said
he
“I
think
miss
hunter
that
we
had
better
go
in
without
you
now
watson
put
your
shoulder
to
it
and
we
shall
see
whether
we
cannot
make
our
way
in
it
was
an
old
rickety
door
and
gave
at
once
before
our
united
strength
together
we
rushed
into
the
room
it
was
empty
there
was
no
furniture
save
little
pallet
bed
small
table
and
basketful
of
linen
the
skylight
above
was
open
and
the
prisoner
gone

“There
has
been
some
villainy
here
said
holmes
“this
beauty
has
guessed
miss
hunter’s
intentions
and
has
carried
his
victim
off
“But
how
“Through
the
skylight
we
shall
soon
see
how
he
managed
it
he
swung
himself
up
onto
the
roof
“Ah
yes
he
cried
“here’s
the
end
of
long
light
ladder
against
the
eaves
that
is
how
he
did
it
“But
it
is
impossible
said
miss
hunter
“the
ladder
was
not
there
when
the
rucastles
went
away
“He
has
come
back
and
done
it
tell
you
that
he
is
clever
and
dangerous
man
should
not
be
very
much
surprised
if
this
were
he
whose
step
hear
now
upon
the
stair
think
watson
that
it
would
be
as
well
for
you
to
have
your
pistol
ready
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
before
man
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
room
very
fat
and
burly
man
with
heavy
stick
in
his
hand
miss
hunter
screamed
and
shrunk
against
the
wall
at
the
sight
of
him
but
sherlock
holmes
sprang
forward
and
confronted
him
“You
villain
said
he
“where’s
your
daughter
the
fat
man
cast
his
eyes
round
and
then
up
at
the
open
skylight
“It
is
for
me
to
ask
you
that
he
shrieked
“you
thieves
spies
and
thieves
have
caught
you
have
you
are
in
my
power
i’ll
serve
you
he
turned
and
clattered
down
the
stairs
as
hard
as
he
could
go
“He’s
gone
for
the
dog
cried
miss
hunter
“I
have
my
revolver
said
“Better
close
the
front
door
cried
holmes
and
we
all
rushed
down
the
stairs
together
we
had
hardly
reached
the
hall
when
we
heard
the
baying
of
hound
and
then
scream
of
agony
with
horrible
worrying
sound
which
it
was
dreadful
to
listen
to
an
elderly
man
with
red
face
and
shaking
limbs
came
staggering
out
at
side
door
“My
god
he
cried
“Someone
has
loosed
the
dog
it’s
not
been
fed
for
two
days
quick
or
it’ll
be
too
late
holmes
and
rushed
out
and
round
the
angle
of
the
house
with
toller
hurrying
behind
us
there
was
the
huge
famished
brute
its
black
muzzle
buried
in
rucastle’s
throat
while
he
writhed
and
screamed
upon
the
ground
running
up
blew
its
brains
out
and
it
fell
over
with
its
keen
white
teeth
still
meeting
in
the
great
creases
of
his
neck
with
much
labour
we
separated
them
and
carried
him
living
but
horribly
mangled
into
the
house
we
laid
him
upon
the
drawing
room
sofa
and
having
dispatched
the
sobered
toller
to
bear
the
news
to
his
wife
did
what
could
to
relieve
his
pain
we
were
all
assembled
round
him
when
the
door
opened
and
tall
gaunt
woman
entered
the
room
“Mrs
toller
cried
miss
hunter
“Yes
miss
mr
rucastle
let
me
out
when
he
came
back
before
he
went
up
to
you
ah
miss
it
is
pity
you
didn’t
let
me
know
what
you
were
planning
for
would
have
told
you
that
your
pains
were
wasted
“Ha
said
holmes
looking
keenly
at
her
“It
is
clear
that
mrs
toller
knows
more
about
this
matter
than
anyone
else
“Yes
sir
do
and
am
ready
enough
to
tell
what
know
“Then
pray
sit
down
and
let
us
hear
it
for
there
are
several
points
on
which
must
confess
that
am
still
in
the
dark
“I
will
soon
make
it
clear
to
you
said
she
“and
i’d
have
done
so
before
now
if
could
ha’
got
out
from
the
cellar
if
there’s
police
court
business
over
this
you’ll
remember
that
was
the
one
that
stood
your
friend
and
that
was
miss
alice’s
friend
too
“She
was
never
happy
at
home
miss
alice
wasn’t
from
the
time
that
her
father
married
again
she
was
slighted
like
and
had
no
say
in
anything
but
it
never
really
became
bad
for
her
until
after
she
met
mr
fowler
at
friend’s
house
as
well
as
could
learn
miss
alice
had
rights
of
her
own
by
will
but
she
was
so
quiet
and
patient
she
was
that
she
never
said
word
about
them
but
just
left
everything
in
mr
rucastle’s
hands
he
knew
he
was
safe
with
her
but
when
there
was
chance
of
husband
coming
forward
who
would
ask
for
all
that
the
law
would
give
him
then
her
father
thought
it
time
to
put
stop
on
it
he
wanted
her
to
sign
paper
so
that
whether
she
married
or
not
he
could
use
her
money
when
she
wouldn’t
do
it
he
kept
on
worrying
her
until
she
got
brain
fever
and
for
six
weeks
was
at
death’s
door
then
she
got
better
at
last
all
worn
to
shadow
and
with
her
beautiful
hair
cut
off
but
that
didn’t
make
no
change
in
her
young
man
and
he
stuck
to
her
as
true
as
man
could
be
“Ah
said
holmes
“I
think
that
what
you
have
been
good
enough
to
tell
us
makes
the
matter
fairly
clear
and
that
can
deduce
all
that
remains
mr
rucastle
then
presume
took
to
this
system
of
imprisonment
“Yes
sir
“And
brought
miss
hunter
down
from
london
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
disagreeable
persistence
of
mr
fowler
“That
was
it
sir
“But
mr
fowler
being
persevering
man
as
good
seaman
should
be
blockaded
the
house
and
having
met
you
succeeded
by
certain
arguments
metallic
or
otherwise
in
convincing
you
that
your
interests
were
the
same
as
his
“Mr
fowler
was
very
kind
spoken
free
handed
gentleman
said
mrs
toller
serenely
“And
in
this
way
he
managed
that
your
good
man
should
have
no
want
of
drink
and
that
ladder
should
be
ready
at
the
moment
when
your
master
had
gone
out
“You
have
it
sir
just
as
it
happened
“I
am
sure
we
owe
you
an
apology
mrs
toller
said
holmes
“for
you
have
certainly
cleared
up
everything
which
puzzled
us
and
here
comes
the
country
surgeon
and
mrs
rucastle
so
think
watson
that
we
had
best
escort
miss
hunter
back
to
winchester
as
it
seems
to
me
that
our
locus
standi
now
is
rather
questionable
one
and
thus
was
solved
the
mystery
of
the
sinister
house
with
the
copper
beeches
in
front
of
the
door
mr
rucastle
survived
but
was
always
broken
man
kept
alive
solely
through
the
care
of
his
devoted
wife
they
still
live
with
their
old
servants
who
probably
know
so
much
of
rucastle’s
past
life
that
he
finds
it
difficult
to
part
from
them
mr
fowler
and
miss
rucastle
were
married
by
special
license
in
southampton
the
day
after
their
flight
and
he
is
now
the
holder
of
government
appointment
in
the
island
of
mauritius
as
to
miss
violet
hunter
my
friend
holmes
rather
to
my
disappointment
manifested
no
further
interest
in
her
when
once
she
had
ceased
to
be
the
centre
of
one
of
his
problems
and
she
is
now
the
head
of
private
school
at
walsall
where
believe
that
she
has
met
with
considerable
success
the
memoirs
of
sherlock
holmes
1894
silver
blaze
am
afraid
watson
that
shall
have
to
go
said
holmes
as
we
sat
down
together
to
our
breakfast
one
morning
go
where
to
dartmoor
to
king
pyland
was
not
surprised
indeed
my
only
wonder
was
that
he
had
not
already
been
mixed
upon
this
extraordinary
case
which
was
the
one
topic
of
conversation
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
england
for
whole
day
my
companion
had
rambled
about
the
room
with
his
chin
upon
his
chest
and
his
brows
knitted
charging
and
recharging
his
pipe
with
the
strongest
black
tobacco
and
absolutely
deaf
to
any
of
my
questions
or
remarks
fresh
editions
of
every
paper
had
been
sent
up
by
our
news
agent
only
to
be
glanced
over
and
tossed
down
into
corner
yet
silent
as
he
was
knew
perfectly
well
what
it
was
over
which
he
was
brooding
there
was
but
one
problem
before
the
public
which
could
challenge
his
powers
of
analysis
and
that
was
the
singular
disappearance
of
the
favorite
for
the
wessex
cup
and
the
tragic
murder
of
its
trainer
when
therefore
he
suddenly
announced
his
intention
of
setting
out
for
the
scene
of
the
drama
it
was
only
what
had
both
expected
and
hoped
for
should
be
most
happy
to
go
down
with
you
if
should
not
be
in
the
way
said
my
dear
watson
you
would
confer
great
favor
upon
me
by
coming
and
think
that
your
time
will
not
be
misspent
for
there
are
points
about
the
case
which
promise
to
make
it
an
absolutely
unique
one
we
have
think
just
time
to
catch
our
train
at
paddington
and
will
go
further
into
the
matter
upon
our
journey
you
would
oblige
me
by
bringing
with
you
your
very
excellent
field
glass
and
so
it
happened
that
an
hour
or
so
later
found
myself
in
the
corner
of
first
class
carriage
flying
along
en
route
for
exeter
while
sherlock
holmes
with
his
sharp
eager
face
framed
in
his
ear
flapped
travelling
cap
dipped
rapidly
into
the
bundle
of
fresh
papers
which
he
had
procured
at
paddington
we
had
left
reading
far
behind
us
before
he
thrust
the
last
one
of
them
under
the
seat
and
offered
me
his
cigar
case
we
are
going
well
said
he
looking
out
the
window
and
glancing
at
his
watch
our
rate
at
present
is
fifty
three
and
half
miles

have
not
observed
the
quarter
mile
posts
said
nor
have
but
the
telegraph
posts
upon
this
line
are
sixty
yards
apart
and
the
calculation
is
simple
one
presume
that
you
have
looked
into
this
matter
of
the
murder
of
john
straker
and
the
disappearance
of
silver
blaze
have
seen
what
the
telegraph
and
the
chronicle
have
to
say
it
is
one
of
those
cases
where
the
art
of
the
reasoner
should
be
used
rather
for
the
sifting
of
details
than
for
the
acquiring
of
fresh
evidence
the
tragedy
has
been
so
uncommon
so
complete
and
of
such
personal
importance
to
so
many
people
that
we
are
suffering
from
plethora
of
surmise
conjecture
and
hypothesis
the
difficulty
is
to
detach
the
framework
of
fact
of
absolute
undeniable
fact
from
the
embellishments
of
theorists
and
reporters
then
having
established
ourselves
upon
this
sound
basis
it
is
our
duty
to
see
what
inferences
may
be
drawn
and
what
are
the
special
points
upon
which
the
whole
mystery
turns
on
tuesday
evening
received
telegrams
from
both
colonel
ross
the
owner
of
the
horse
and
from
inspector
gregory
who
is
looking
after
the
case
inviting
my
cooperation
tuesday
evening
exclaimed
and
this
is
thursday
morning
why
didn
you
go
down
yesterday
because
made
blunder
my
dear
watson
which
is
am
afraid
more
common
occurrence
than
any
one
would
think
who
only
knew
me
through
your
memoirs
the
fact
is
that
could
not
believe
is
possible
that
the
most
remarkable
horse
in
england
could
long
remain
concealed
especially
in
so
sparsely
inhabited
place
as
the
north
of
dartmoor
from
hour
to
hour
yesterday
expected
to
hear
that
he
had
been
found
and
that
his
abductor
was
the
murderer
of
john
straker
when
however
another
morning
had
come
and
found
that
beyond
the
arrest
of
young
fitzroy
simpson
nothing
had
been
done
felt
that
it
was
time
for
me
to
take
action
yet
in
some
ways
feel
that
yesterday
has
not
been
wasted
you
have
formed
theory
then
at
least
have
got
grip
of
the
essential
facts
of
the
case
shall
enumerate
them
to
you
for
nothing
clears
up
case
so
much
as
stating
it
to
another
person
and
can
hardly
expect
your
co
operation
if
do
not
show
you
the
position
from
which
we
start
lay
back
against
the
cushions
puffing
at
my
cigar
while
holmes
leaning
forward
with
his
long
thin
forefinger
checking
off
the
points
upon
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
gave
me
sketch
of
the
events
which
had
led
to
our
journey
silver
blaze
said
he
is
from
the
somomy
stock
and
holds
as
brilliant
record
as
his
famous
ancestor
he
is
now
in
his
fifth
year
and
has
brought
in
turn
each
of
the
prizes
of
the
turf
to
colonel
ross
his
fortunate
owner
up
to
the
time
of
the
catastrophe
he
was
the
first
favorite
for
the
wessex
cup
the
betting
being
three
to
one
on
him
he
has
always
however
been
prime
favorite
with
the
racing
public
and
has
never
yet
disappointed
them
so
that
even
at
those
odds
enormous
sums
of
money
have
been
laid
upon
him
it
is
obvious
therefore
that
there
were
many
people
who
had
the
strongest
interest
in
preventing
silver
blaze
from
being
there
at
the
fall
of
the
flag
next
tuesday
the
fact
was
of
course
appreciated
at
king
pyland
where
the
colonel
training
stable
is
situated
every
precaution
was
taken
to
guard
the
favorite
the
trainer
john
straker
is
retired
jockey
who
rode
in
colonel
ross
colours
before
he
became
too
heavy
for
the
weighing
chair
he
has
served
the
colonel
for
five
years
as
jockey
and
for
seven
as
trainer
and
has
always
shown
himself
to
be
zealous
and
honest
servant
under
him
were
three
lads
for
the
establishment
was
small
one
containing
only
four
horses
in
all
one
of
these
lads
sat
up
each
night
in
the
stable
while
the
others
slept
in
the
loft
all
three
bore
excellent
characters
john
straker
who
is
married
man
lived
in
small
villa
about
two
hundred
yards
from
the
stables
he
has
no
children
keeps
one
maid
servant
and
is
comfortably
off
the
country
round
is
very
lonely
but
about
half
mile
to
the
north
there
is
small
cluster
of
villas
which
have
been
built
by
tavistock
contractor
for
the
use
of
invalids
and
others
who
may
wish
to
enjoy
the
pure
dartmoor
air
tavistock
itself
lies
two
miles
to
the
west
while
across
the
moor
also
about
two
miles
distant
is
the
larger
training
establishment
of
mapleton
which
belongs
to
lord
backwater
and
is
managed
by
silas
brown
in
every
other
direction
the
moor
is
complete
wilderness
inhabited
only
be
few
roaming
gypsies
such
was
the
general
situation
last
monday
night
when
the
catastrophe
occurred
on
that
evening
the
horses
had
been
exercised
and
watered
as
usual
and
the
stables
were
locked
up
at
nine
clock
two
of
the
lads
walked
up
to
the
trainer
house
where
they
had
supper
in
the
kitchen
while
the
third
ned
hunter
remained
on
guard
at
few
minutes
after
nine
the
maid
edith
baxter
carried
down
to
the
stables
his
supper
which
consisted
of
dish
of
curried
mutton
she
took
no
liquid
as
there
was
water
tap
in
the
stables
and
it
was
the
rule
that
the
lad
on
duty
should
drink
nothing
else
the
maid
carried
lantern
with
her
as
it
was
very
dark
and
the
path
ran
across
the
open
moor
edith
baxter
was
within
thirty
yards
of
the
stables
when
man
appeared
out
of
the
darkness
and
called
to
her
to
stop
as
he
stepped
into
the
circle
of
yellow
light
thrown
by
the
lantern
she
saw
that
he
was
person
of
gentlemanly
bearing
dressed
in
grey
suit
of
tweeds
with
cloth
cap
he
wore
gaiters
and
carried
heavy
stick
with
knob
to
it
she
was
most
impressed
however
by
the
extreme
pallor
of
his
face
and
by
the
nervousness
of
his
manner
his
age
she
thought
would
be
rather
over
thirty
than
under
it
can
you
tell
me
where
am
he
asked
had
almost
made
up
my
mind
to
sleep
on
the
moor
when
saw
the
light
of
your
lantern
you
are
close
to
the
king
pyland
training
stables
said
she
oh
indeed
what
stroke
of
luck
he
cried
understand
that
stable
boy
sleeps
there
alone
every
night
perhaps
that
is
his
supper
which
you
are
carrying
to
him
now
am
sure
that
you
would
not
be
too
proud
to
earn
the
price
of
new
dress
would
you
he
took
piece
of
white
paper
folded
up
out
of
his
waistcoat
pocket
see
that
the
boy
has
this
to
night
and
you
shall
have
the
prettiest
frock
that
money
can
buy
she
was
frightened
by
the
earnestness
of
his
manner
and
ran
past
him
to
the
window
through
which
she
was
accustomed
to
hand
the
meals
it
was
already
opened
and
hunter
was
seated
at
the
small
table
inside
she
had
begun
to
tell
him
of
what
had
happened
when
the
stranger
came
up
again
good
evening
said
he
looking
through
the
window
wanted
to
have
word
with
you
the
girl
has
sworn
that
as
he
spoke
she
noticed
the
corner
of
the
little
paper
packet
protruding
from
his
closed
hand
what
business
have
you
here
asked
the
lad
it
business
that
may
put
something
into
your
pocket
said
the
other
you
ve
two
horses
in
for
the
wessex
cup
silver
blaze
and
bayard
let
me
have
the
straight
tip
and
you
won
be
loser
is
it
fact
that
at
the
weights
bayard
could
give
the
other
hundred
yards
in
five
furlongs
and
that
the
stable
have
put
their
money
on
him
so
you
re
one
of
those
damned
touts
cried
the
lad
ll
show
you
how
we
serve
them
in
king
pyland
he
sprang
up
and
rushed
across
the
stable
to
unloose
the
dog
the
girl
fled
away
to
the
house
but
as
she
ran
she
looked
back
and
saw
that
the
stranger
was
leaning
through
the
window
minute
later
however
when
hunter
rushed
out
with
the
hound
he
was
gone
and
though
he
ran
all
round
the
buildings
he
failed
to
find
any
trace
of
him
one
moment
asked
did
the
stable
boy
when
he
ran
out
with
the
dog
leave
the
door
unlocked
behind
him
excellent
watson
excellent
murmured
my
companion
the
importance
of
the
point
struck
me
so
forcibly
that
sent
special
wire
to
dartmoor
yesterday
to
clear
the
matter
up
the
boy
locked
the
door
before
he
left
it
the
window
may
add
was
not
large
enough
for
man
to
get
through
hunter
waited
until
his
fellow
grooms
had
returned
when
he
sent
message
to
the
trainer
and
told
him
what
had
occurred
straker
was
excited
at
hearing
the
account
although
he
does
not
seem
to
have
quite
realized
its
true
significance
it
left
him
however
vaguely
uneasy
and
mrs
straker
waking
at
one
in
the
morning
found
that
he
was
dressing
in
reply
to
her
inquiries
he
said
that
he
could
not
sleep
on
account
of
his
anxiety
about
the
horses
and
that
he
intended
to
walk
down
to
the
stables
to
see
that
all
was
well
she
begged
him
to
remain
at
home
as
she
could
hear
the
rain
pattering
against
the
window
but
in
spite
of
her
entreaties
he
pulled
on
his
large
mackintosh
and
left
the
house
mrs
straker
awoke
at
seven
in
the
morning
to
find
that
her
husband
had
not
yet
returned
she
dressed
herself
hastily
called
the
maid
and
set
off
for
the
stables
the
door
was
open
inside
huddled
together
upon
chair
hunter
was
sunk
in
state
of
absolute
stupor
the
favorite
stall
was
empty
and
there
were
no
signs
of
his
trainer

the
two
lads
who
slept
in
the
chaff
cutting
loft
above
the
harness
room
were
quickly
aroused
they
had
heard
nothing
during
the
night
for
they
are
both
sound
sleepers
hunter
was
obviously
under
the
influence
of
some
powerful
drug
and
as
no
sense
could
be
got
out
of
him
he
was
left
to
sleep
it
off
while
the
two
lads
and
the
two
women
ran
out
in
search
of
the
absentees
they
still
had
hopes
that
the
trainer
had
for
some
reason
taken
out
the
horse
for
early
exercise
but
on
ascending
the
knoll
near
the
house
from
which
all
the
neighboring
moors
were
visible
they
not
only
could
see
no
signs
of
the
missing
favorite
but
they
perceived
something
which
warned
them
that
they
were
in
the
presence
of
tragedy
about
quarter
of
mile
from
the
stables
john
straker
overcoat
was
flapping
from
furze
bush
immediately
beyond
there
was
bowl
shaped
depression
in
the
moor
and
at
the
bottom
of
this
was
found
the
dead
body
of
the
unfortunate
trainer
his
head
had
been
shattered
by
savage
blow
from
some
heavy
weapon
and
he
was
wounded
on
the
thigh
where
there
was
long
clean
cut
inflicted
evidently
by
some
very
sharp
instrument
it
was
clear
however
that
straker
had
defended
himself
vigorously
against
his
assailants
for
in
his
right
hand
he
held
small
knife
which
was
clotted
with
blood
up
to
the
handle
while
in
his
left
he
clasped
red
and
black
silk
cravat
which
was
recognized
by
the
maid
as
having
been
worn
on
the
preceding
evening
by
the
stranger
who
had
visited
the
stables
hunter
on
recovering
from
his
stupor
was
also
quite
positive
as
to
the
ownership
of
the
cravat
he
was
equally
certain
that
the
same
stranger
had
while
standing
at
the
window
drugged
his
curried
mutton
and
so
deprived
the
stables
of
their
watchman
as
to
the
missing
horse
there
were
abundant
proofs
in
the
mud
which
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
fatal
hollow
that
he
had
been
there
at
the
time
of
the
struggle
but
from
that
morning
he
has
disappeared
and
although
large
reward
has
been
offered
and
all
the
gypsies
of
dartmoor
are
on
the
alert
no
news
has
come
of
him
finally
an
analysis
has
shown
that
the
remains
of
his
supper
left
by
the
stable
lad
contain
an
appreciable
quantity
of
powdered
opium
while
the
people
at
the
house
partook
of
the
same
dish
on
the
same
night
without
any
ill
effect
those
are
the
main
facts
of
the
case
stripped
of
all
surmise
and
stated
as
baldly
as
possible
shall
now
recapitulate
what
the
police
have
done
in
the
matter
inspector
gregory
to
whom
the
case
has
been
committed
is
an
extremely
competent
officer
were
he
but
gifted
with
imagination
he
might
rise
to
great
heights
in
his
profession
on
his
arrival
he
promptly
found
and
arrested
the
man
upon
whom
suspicion
naturally
rested
there
was
little
difficulty
in
finding
him
for
he
inhabited
one
of
those
villas
which
have
mentioned
his
name
it
appears
was
fitzroy
simpson
he
was
man
of
excellent
birth
and
education
who
had
squandered
fortune
upon
the
turf
and
who
lived
now
by
doing
little
quiet
and
genteel
book
making
in
the
sporting
clubs
of
london
an
examination
of
his
betting
book
shows
that
bets
to
the
amount
of
five
thousand
pounds
had
been
registered
by
him
against
the
favorite
on
being
arrested
he
volunteered
that
statement
that
he
had
come
down
to
dartmoor
in
the
hope
of
getting
some
information
about
the
king
pyland
horses
and
also
about
desborough
the
second
favorite
which
was
in
charge
of
silas
brown
at
the
mapleton
stables
he
did
not
attempt
to
deny
that
he
had
acted
as
described
upon
the
evening
before
but
declared
that
he
had
no
sinister
designs
and
had
simply
wished
to
obtain
first
hand
information
when
confronted
with
his
cravat
he
turned
very
pale
and
was
utterly
unable
to
account
for
its
presence
in
the
hand
of
the
murdered
man
his
wet
clothing
showed
that
he
had
been
out
in
the
storm
of
the
night
before
and
his
stick
which
was
penang
lawyer
weighted
with
lead
was
just
such
weapon
as
might
by
repeated
blows
have
inflicted
the
terrible
injuries
to
which
the
trainer
had
succumbed
on
the
other
hand
there
was
no
wound
upon
his
person
while
the
state
of
straker
knife
would
show
that
one
at
least
of
his
assailants
must
bear
his
mark
upon
him
there
you
have
it
all
in
nutshell
watson
and
if
you
can
give
me
any
light
shall
be
infinitely
obliged
to
you
had
listened
with
the
greatest
interest
to
the
statement
which
holmes
with
characteristic
clearness
had
laid
before
me
though
most
of
the
facts
were
familiar
to
me
had
not
sufficiently
appreciated
their
relative
importance
nor
their
connection
to
each
other
is
in
not
possible
suggested
that
the
incised
would
upon
straker
may
have
been
caused
by
his
own
knife
in
the
convulsive
struggles
which
follow
any
brain
injury
it
is
more
than
possible
it
is
probable
said
holmes
in
that
case
one
of
the
main
points
in
favor
of
the
accused
disappears
and
yet
said
even
now
fail
to
understand
what
the
theory
of
the
police
can
be
am
afraid
that
whatever
theory
we
state
has
very
grave
objections
to
it
returned
my
companion
the
police
imagine
take
it
that
this
fitzroy
simpson
having
drugged
the
lad
and
having
in
some
way
obtained
duplicate
key
opened
the
stable
door
and
took
out
the
horse
with
the
intention
apparently
of
kidnapping
him
altogether
his
bridle
is
missing
so
that
simpson
must
have
put
this
on
then
having
left
the
door
open
behind
him
he
was
leading
the
horse
away
over
the
moor
when
he
was
either
met
or
overtaken
by
the
trainer
row
naturally
ensued
simpson
beat
out
the
trainer
brains
with
his
heavy
stick
without
receiving
any
injury
from
the
small
knife
which
straker
used
in
self
defence
and
then
the
thief
either
led
the
horse
on
to
some
secret
hiding
place
or
else
it
may
have
bolted
during
the
struggle
and
be
now
wandering
out
on
the
moors
that
is
the
case
as
it
appears
to
the
police
and
improbable
as
it
is
all
other
explanations
are
more
improbable
still
however
shall
very
quickly
test
the
matter
when
am
once
upon
the
spot
and
until
then
cannot
really
see
how
we
can
get
much
further
than
our
present
position
it
was
evening
before
we
reached
the
little
town
of
tavistock
which
lies
like
the
boss
of
shield
in
the
middle
of
the
huge
circle
of
dartmoor
two
gentlemen
were
awaiting
us
in
the
station
the
one
tall
fair
man
with
lion
like
hair
and
beard
and
curiously
penetrating
light
blue
eyes
the
other
small
alert
person
very
neat
and
dapper
in
frock
coat
and
gaiters
with
trim
little
side
whiskers
and
an
eye
glass
the
latter
was
colonel
ross
the
well
known
sportsman
the
other
inspector
gregory
man
who
was
rapidly
making
his
name
in
the
english
detective
service
am
delighted
that
you
have
come
down
mr
holmes
said
the
colonel
the
inspector
here
has
done
all
that
could
possibly
be
suggested
but
wish
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
in
trying
to
avenge
poor
straker
and
in
recovering
my
horse
have
there
been
any
fresh
developments
asked
holmes
am
sorry
to
say
that
we
have
made
very
little
progress
said
the
inspector
we
have
an
open
carriage
outside
and
as
you
would
no
doubt
like
to
see
the
place
before
the
light
fails
we
might
talk
it
over
as
we
drive
minute
later
we
were
all
seated
in
comfortable
landau
and
were
rattling
through
the
quaint
old
devonshire
city
inspector
gregory
was
full
of
his
case
and
poured
out
stream
of
remarks
while
holmes
threw
in
an
occasional
question
or
interjection
colonel
ross
leaned
back
with
his
arms
folded
and
his
hat
tilted
over
his
eyes
while
listened
with
interest
to
the
dialogue
of
the
two
detectives
gregory
was
formulating
his
theory
which
was
almost
exactly
what
holmes
had
foretold
in
the
train
the
net
is
drawn
pretty
close
round
fitzroy
simpson
he
remarked
and
believe
myself
that
he
is
our
man
at
the
same
time
recognize
that
the
evidence
is
purely
circumstantial
and
that
some
new
development
may
upset
it
how
about
straker
knife
we
have
quite
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
wounded
himself
in
his
fall
my
friend
dr
watson
made
that
suggestion
to
me
as
we
came
down
if
so
it
would
tell
against
this
man
simpson
undoubtedly
he
has
neither
knife
nor
any
sign
of
wound
the
evidence
against
him
is
certainly
very
strong
he
had
great
interest
in
the
disappearance
of
the
favorite
he
lies
under
suspicion
of
having
poisoned
the
stable
boy
he
was
undoubtedly
out
in
the
storm
he
was
armed
with
heavy
stick
and
his
cravat
was
found
in
the
dead
man
hand
really
think
we
have
enough
to
go
before
jury
holmes
shook
his
head
clever
counsel
would
tear
it
all
to
rags
said
he
why
should
he
take
the
horse
out
of
the
stable
if
he
wished
to
injure
it
why
could
he
not
do
it
there
has
duplicate
key
been
found
in
his
possession
what
chemist
sold
him
the
powdered
opium
above
all
where
could
he
stranger
to
the
district
hide
horse
and
such
horse
as
this
what
is
his
own
explanation
as
to
the
paper
which
he
wished
the
maid
to
give
to
the
stable
boy
страница

из
392
he
says
that
it
was
ten
pound
note
one
was
found
in
his
purse
but
your
other
difficulties
are
not
so
formidable
as
they
seem
he
is
not
stranger
to
the
district
he
has
twice
lodged
at
tavistock
in
the
summer
the
opium
was
probably
brought
from
london
the
key
having
served
its
purpose
would
be
hurled
away
the
horse
may
be
at
the
bottom
of
one
of
the
pits
or
old
mines
upon
the
moor
what
does
he
say
about
the
cravat
he
acknowledges
that
it
is
his
and
declares
that
he
had
lost
it
but
new
element
has
been
introduced
into
the
case
which
may
account
for
his
leading
the
horse
from
the
stable
holmes
pricked
up
his
ears
we
have
found
traces
which
show
that
party
of
gypsies
encamped
on
monday
night
within
mile
of
the
spot
where
the
murder
took
place
on
tuesday
they
were
gone
now
presuming
that
there
was
some
understanding
between
simpson
and
these
gypsies
might
he
not
have
been
leading
the
horse
to
them
when
he
was
overtaken
and
may
they
not
have
him
now
it
is
certainly
possible
the
moor
is
being
scoured
for
these
gypsies
have
also
examined
every
stable
and
out
house
in
tavistock
and
for
radius
of
ten
miles
there
is
another
training
stable
quite
close
understand
yes
and
that
is
factor
which
we
must
certainly
not
neglect
as
desborough
their
horse
was
second
in
the
betting
they
had
an
interest
in
the
disappearance
of
the
favorite
silas
brown
the
trainer
is
known
to
have
had
large
bets
upon
the
event
and
he
was
no
friend
to
poor
straker
we
have
however
examined
the
stables
and
there
is
nothing
to
connect
him
with
the
affair
and
nothing
to
connect
this
man
simpson
with
the
interests
of
the
mapleton
stables
nothing
at
all
holmes
leaned
back
in
the
carriage
and
the
conversation
ceased
few
minutes
later
our
driver
pulled
up
at
neat
little
red
brick
villa
with
overhanging
eaves
which
stood
by
the
road
some
distance
off
across
paddock
lay
long
grey
tiled
out
building
in
every
other
direction
the
low
curves
of
the
moor
bronze
coloured
from
the
fading
ferns
stretched
away
to
the
sky
line
broken
only
by
the
steeples
of
tavistock
and
by
cluster
of
houses
away
to
the
westward
which
marked
the
mapleton
stables
we
all
sprang
out
with
the
exception
of
holmes
who
continued
to
lean
back
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
sky
in
front
of
him
entirely
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
it
was
only
when
touched
his
arm
that
he
roused
himself
with
violent
start
and
stepped
out
of
the
carriage
excuse
me
said
he
turning
to
colonel
ross
who
had
looked
at
him
in
some
surprise
was
day
dreaming
there
was
gleam
in
his
eyes
and
suppressed
excitement
in
his
manner
which
convinced
me
used
as
was
to
his
ways
that
his
hand
was
upon
clue
though
could
not
imagine
where
he
had
found
it
perhaps
you
would
prefer
at
once
to
go
on
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
mr
holmes
said
gregory
think
that
should
prefer
to
stay
here
little
and
go
into
one
or
two
questions
of
detail
straker
was
brought
back
here
presume
yes
he
lies
upstairs
the
inquest
is
to
morrow
he
has
been
in
your
service
some
years
colonel
ross
have
always
found
him
an
excellent
servant
presume
that
you
made
an
inventory
of
what
he
had
in
this
pockets
at
the
time
of
his
death
inspector
have
the
things
themselves
in
the
sitting
room
if
you
would
care
to
see
them
should
be
very
glad
we
all
filed
into
the
front
room
and
sat
round
the
central
table
while
the
inspector
unlocked
square
tin
box
and
laid
small
heap
of
things
before
us
there
was
box
of
vestas
two
inches
of
tallow
candle
an
brier
root
pipe
pouch
of
seal
skin
with
half
an
ounce
of
long
cut
cavendish
silver
watch
with
gold
chain
five
sovereigns
in
gold
an
aluminum
pencil
case
few
papers
and
an
ivory
handled
knife
with
very
delicate
inflexible
bade
marked
weiss
co
london
this
is
very
singular
knife
said
holmes
lifting
it
up
and
examining
it
minutely
presume
as
see
blood
stains
upon
it
that
it
is
the
one
which
was
found
in
the
dead
man
grasp
watson
this
knife
is
surely
in
your
line
it
is
what
we
call
cataract
knife
said
thought
so
very
delicate
blade
devised
for
very
delicate
work
strange
thing
for
man
to
carry
with
him
upon
rough
expedition
especially
as
it
would
not
shut
in
his
pocket
the
tip
was
guarded
by
disk
of
cork
which
we
found
beside
his
body
said
the
inspector
his
wife
tells
us
that
the
knife
had
lain
upon
the
dressing
table
and
that
he
had
picked
it
up
as
he
left
the
room
it
was
poor
weapon
but
perhaps
the
best
that
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
at
the
moment
very
possible
how
about
these
papers
three
of
them
are
receipted
hay
dealers
accounts
one
of
them
is
letter
of
instructions
from
colonel
ross
this
other
is
milliner
account
for
thirty
seven
pounds
fifteen
made
out
by
madame
lesurier
of
bond
street
to
william
derbyshire
mrs
straker
tells
us
that
derbyshire
was
friend
of
her
husband
and
that
occasionally
his
letters
were
addressed
here
madam
derbyshire
had
somewhat
expensive
tastes
remarked
holmes
glancing
down
the
account
twenty
two
guineas
is
rather
heavy
for
single
costume
however
there
appears
to
be
nothing
more
to
learn
and
we
may
now
go
down
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
as
we
emerged
from
the
sitting
room
woman
who
had
been
waiting
in
the
passage
took
step
forward
and
laid
her
hand
upon
the
inspector
sleeve
her
face
was
haggard
and
thin
and
eager
stamped
with
the
print
of
recent
horror
have
you
got
them
have
you
found
them
she
panted
no
mrs
straker
but
mr
holmes
here
has
come
from
london
to
help
us
and
we
shall
do
all
that
is
possible
surely
met
you
in
plymouth
at
garden
party
some
little
time
ago
mrs
straker
said
holmes
no
sir
you
are
mistaken
dear
me
why
could
have
sworn
to
it
you
wore
costume
of
dove
coloured
silk
with
ostrich
feather
trimming
never
had
such
dress
sir
answered
the
lady
ah
that
quite
settles
it
said
holmes
and
with
an
apology
he
followed
the
inspector
outside
short
walk
across
the
moor
took
us
to
the
hollow
in
which
the
body
had
been
found
at
the
brink
of
it
was
the
furze
bush
upon
which
the
coat
had
been
hung
there
was
no
wind
that
night
understand
said
holmes
none
but
very
heavy
rain
in
that
case
the
overcoat
was
not
blown
against
the
furze
bush
but
placed
there
yes
it
was
laid
across
the
bush
you
fill
me
with
interest
perceive
that
the
ground
has
been
trampled
up
good
deal
no
doubt
many
feet
have
been
here
since
monday
night
piece
of
matting
has
been
laid
here
at
the
side
and
we
have
all
stood
upon
that
excellent
in
this
bag
have
one
of
the
boots
which
straker
wore
one
of
fitzroy
simpson
shoes
and
cast
horseshoe
of
silver
blaze
my
dear
inspector
you
surpass
yourself
homes
took
the
bag
and
descending
into
the
hollow
he
pushed
the
matting
into
more
central
position
then
stretching
himself
upon
his
face
and
leaning
his
chin
upon
his
hands
he
made
careful
study
of
the
trampled
mud
in
front
of
him
hullo
said
he
suddenly
what
this
it
was
wax
vesta
half
burned
which
was
so
coated
with
mud
that
it
looked
at
first
like
little
chip
of
wood
cannot
think
how
came
to
overlook
it
said
the
inspector
with
an
expression
of
annoyance
it
was
invisible
buried
in
the
mud
only
saw
it
because
was
looking
for
it
what
you
expected
to
find
it
thought
it
not
unlikely
he
took
the
boots
from
the
bag
and
compared
the
impressions
of
each
of
them
with
marks
upon
the
ground
then
he
clambered
up
to
the
rim
of
the
hollow
and
crawled
about
among
the
ferns
and
bushes
am
afraid
that
there
are
no
more
tracks
said
the
inspector
have
examined
the
ground
very
carefully
for
hundred
yards
in
each
direction
indeed
said
holmes
rising
should
not
have
the
impertinence
to
do
it
again
after
what
you
say
but
should
like
to
take
little
walk
over
the
moor
before
it
grows
dark
that
may
know
my
ground
to
morrow
and
think
that
shall
put
this
horseshoe
into
my
pocket
for
luck
colonel
ross
who
had
shown
some
signs
of
impatience
at
my
companion
quiet
and
systematic
method
of
work
glanced
at
his
watch
wish
you
would
come
back
with
me
inspector
said
he
there
are
several
points
on
which
should
like
your
advice
and
especially
as
to
whether
we
do
not
owe
it
to
the
public
to
remove
our
horse
name
from
the
entries
for
the
cup
certainly
not
cried
holmes
with
decision
should
let
the
name
stand
the
colonel
bowed
am
very
glad
to
have
had
your
opinion
sir
said
he
you
will
find
us
at
poor
straker
house
when
you
have
finished
your
walk
and
we
can
drive
together
into
tavistock
he
turned
back
with
the
inspector
while
holmes
and
walked
slowly
across
the
moor
the
sun
was
beginning
to
sink
behind
the
stables
of
mapleton
and
the
long
sloping
plain
in
front
of
us
was
tinged
with
gold
deepening
into
rich
ruddy
browns
where
the
faded
ferns
and
brambles
caught
the
evening
light
but
the
glories
of
the
landscape
were
all
wasted
upon
my
companion
who
was
sunk
in
the
deepest
thought
it
this
way
watson
said
he
at
last
we
may
leave
the
question
of
who
killed
john
straker
for
the
instant
and
confine
ourselves
to
finding
out
what
has
become
of
the
horse
now
supposing
that
he
broke
away
during
or
after
the
tragedy
where
could
he
have
gone
to
the
horse
is
very
gregarious
creature
if
left
to
himself
his
instincts
would
have
been
either
to
return
to
king
pyland
or
go
over
to
mapleton
why
should
he
run
wild
upon
the
moor
he
would
surely
have
been
seen
by
now
and
why
should
gypsies
kidnap
him
these
people
always
clear
out
when
they
hear
of
trouble
for
they
do
not
wish
to
be
pestered
by
the
police
they
could
not
hope
to
sell
such
horse
they
would
run
great
risk
and
gain
nothing
by
taking
him
surely
that
is
clear
where
is
he
then
have
already
said
that
he
must
have
gone
to
king
pyland
or
to
mapleton
he
is
not
at
king
pyland
therefore
he
is
at
mapleton
let
us
take
that
as
working
hypothesis
and
see
what
it
leads
us
to
this
part
of
the
moor
as
the
inspector
remarked
is
very
hard
and
dry
but
if
falls
away
towards
mapleton
and
you
can
see
from
here
that
there
is
long
hollow
over
yonder
which
must
have
been
very
wet
on
monday
night
if
our
supposition
is
correct
then
the
horse
must
have
crossed
that
and
there
is
the
point
where
we
should
look
for
his
tracks
we
had
been
walking
briskly
during
this
conversation
and
few
more
minutes
brought
us
to
the
hollow
in
question
at
holmes
request
walked
down
the
bank
to
the
right
and
he
to
the
left
but
had
not
taken
fifty
paces
before
heard
him
give
shout
and
saw
him
waving
his
hand
to
me
the
track
of
horse
was
plainly
outlined
in
the
soft
earth
in
front
of
him
and
the
shoe
which
he
took
from
his
pocket
exactly
fitted
the
impression
see
the
value
of
imagination
said
holmes
it
is
the
one
quality
which
gregory
lacks
we
imagined
what
might
have
happened
acted
upon
the
supposition
and
find
ourselves
justified
let
us
proceed
we
crossed
the
marshy
bottom
and
passed
over
quarter
of
mile
of
dry
hard
turf
again
the
ground
sloped
and
again
we
came
on
the
tracks
then
we
lost
them
for
half
mile
but
only
to
pick
them
up
once
more
quite
close
to
mapleton
it
was
holmes
who
saw
them
first
and
he
stood
pointing
with
look
of
triumph
upon
his
face
man
track
was
visible
beside
the
horse
the
horse
was
alone
before
cried
quite
so
it
was
alone
before
hullo
what
is
this
the
double
track
turned
sharp
off
and
took
the
direction
of
king
pyland
homes
whistled
and
we
both
followed
along
after
it
his
eyes
were
on
the
trail
but
happened
to
look
little
to
one
side
and
saw
to
my
surprise
the
same
tracks
coming
back
again
in
the
opposite
direction
one
for
you
watson
said
holmes
when
pointed
it
out
you
have
saved
us
long
walk
which
would
have
brought
us
back
on
our
own
traces
let
us
follow
the
return
track
we
had
not
to
go
far
it
ended
at
the
paving
of
asphalt
which
led
up
to
the
gates
of
the
mapleton
stables
as
we
approached
groom
ran
out
from
them
we
don
want
any
loiterers
about
here
said
he
only
wished
to
ask
question
said
holmes
with
his
finger
and
thumb
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
should
be
too
early
to
see
your
master
mr
silas
brown
if
were
to
call
at
five
clock
to
morrow
morning
bless
you
sir
if
any
one
is
about
he
will
be
for
he
is
always
the
first
stirring
but
here
he
is
sir
to
answer
your
questions
for
himself
no
sir
no
it
is
as
much
as
my
place
is
worth
to
let
him
see
me
touch
your
money
afterwards
if
you
like
as
sherlock
holmes
replaced
the
half
crown
which
he
had
drawn
from
his
pocket
fierce
looking
elderly
man
strode
out
from
the
gate
with
hunting
crop
swinging
in
his
hand
what
this
dawson
he
cried
no
gossiping
go
about
your
business
and
you
what
the
devil
do
you
want
here
ten
minutes
talk
with
you
my
good
sir
said
holmes
in
the
sweetest
of
voices
ve
no
time
to
talk
to
every
gadabout
we
want
no
stranger
here
be
off
or
you
may
find
dog
at
your
heels
holmes
leaned
forward
and
whispered
something
in
the
trainer
ear
he
started
violently
and
flushed
to
the
temples
it
lie
he
shouted
an
infernal
lie
very
good
shall
we
argue
about
it
here
in
public
or
talk
it
over
in
your
parlor
oh
come
in
if
you
wish
to
holmes
smiled
shall
not
keep
you
more
than
few
minutes
watson
said
he
now
mr
brown
am
quite
at
your
disposal
it
was
twenty
minutes
and
the
reds
had
all
faded
into
greys
before
holmes
and
the
trainer
reappeared
never
have
seen
such
change
as
had
been
brought
about
in
silas
brown
in
that
short
time
his
face
was
ashy
pale
beads
of
perspiration
shone
upon
his
brow
and
his
hands
shook
until
the
hunting
crop
wagged
like
branch
in
the
wind
his
bullying
overbearing
manner
was
all
gone
too
and
he
cringed
along
at
my
companion
side
like
dog
with
its
master
you
instructions
will
be
done
it
shall
all
be
done
said
he
there
must
be
no
mistake
said
holmes
looking
round
at
him
the
other
winced
as
he
read
the
menace
in
his
eyes
oh
no
there
shall
be
no
mistake
it
shall
be
there
should
change
it
first
or
not
holmes
thought
little
and
then
burst
out
laughing
no
don
said
he
shall
write
to
you
about
it
no
tricks
now
or—
oh
you
can
trust
me
you
can
trust
me
yes
think
can
well
you
shall
hear
from
me
to
morrow
he
turned
upon
his
heel
disregarding
the
trembling
hand
which
the
other
held
out
to
him
and
we
set
off
for
king
pyland
more
perfect
compound
of
the
bully
coward
and
sneak
than
master
silas
brown
have
seldom
met
with
remarked
holmes
as
we
trudged
along
together
he
has
the
horse
then
he
tried
to
bluster
out
of
it
but
described
to
him
so
exactly
what
his
actions
had
been
upon
that
morning
that
he
is
convinced
that
was
watching
him
of
course
you
observed
the
peculiarly
square
toes
in
the
impressions
and
that
his
own
boots
exactly
corresponded
to
them
again
of
course
no
subordinate
would
have
dared
to
do
such
thing
described
to
him
how
when
according
to
his
custom
he
was
the
first
down
he
perceived
strange
horse
wandering
over
the
moor
how
he
went
out
to
it
and
his
astonishment
at
recognizing
from
the
white
forehead
which
has
given
the
favorite
its
name
that
chance
had
put
in
his
power
the
only
horse
which
could
beat
the
one
upon
which
he
had
put
his
money
then
described
how
his
first
impulse
had
been
to
lead
him
back
to
king
pyland
and
how
the
devil
had
shown
him
how
he
could
hide
the
horse
until
the
race
was
over
and
how
he
had
led
it
back
and
concealed
it
at
mapleton
when
told
him
every
detail
he
gave
it
up
and
thought
only
of
saving
his
own
skin
but
his
stables
had
been
searched
oh
and
old
horse
fakir
like
him
has
many
dodge
but
are
you
not
afraid
to
leave
the
horse
in
his
power
now
since
he
has
every
interest
in
injuring
it
my
dear
fellow
he
will
guard
it
as
the
apple
of
his
eye
he
knows
that
his
only
hope
of
mercy
is
to
produce
it
safe
colonel
ross
did
not
impress
me
as
man
who
would
be
likely
to
show
much
mercy
in
any
case
the
matter
does
not
rest
with
colonel
ross
follow
my
own
methods
and
tell
as
much
or
as
little
as
choose
that
is
the
advantage
of
being
unofficial
don
know
whether
you
observed
it
watson
but
the
colonel
manner
has
been
just
trifle
cavalier
to
me
am
inclined
now
to
have
little
amusement
at
his
expense
say
nothing
to
him
about
the
horse
certainly
not
without
your
permission
and
of
course
this
is
all
quite
minor
point
compared
to
the
question
of
who
killed
john
straker
and
you
will
devote
yourself
to
that
on
the
contrary
we
both
go
back
to
london
by
the
night
train
was
thunderstruck
by
my
friend
words
we
had
only
been
few
hours
in
devonshire
and
that
he
should
give
up
an
investigation
which
he
had
begun
so
brilliantly
was
quite
incomprehensible
to
me
not
word
more
could
draw
from
him
until
we
were
back
at
the
trainer
house
the
colonel
and
the
inspector
were
awaiting
us
in
the
parlor
my
friend
and
return
to
town
by
the
night
express
said
holmes
we
have
had
charming
little
breath
of
your
beautiful
dartmoor
air
the
inspector
opened
his
eyes
and
the
colonel
lip
curled
in
sneer
so
you
despair
of
arresting
the
murderer
of
poor
straker
said
he
страница

holmes
shrugged
his
shoulders
there
are
certainly
grave
difficulties
in
the
way
said
he
have
every
hope
however
that
your
horse
will
start
upon
tuesday
and
beg
that
you
will
have
your
jockey
in
readiness
might
ask
for
photograph
of
mr
john
straker
the
inspector
took
one
from
an
envelope
and
handed
it
to
him
my
dear
gregory
you
anticipate
all
my
wants
if
might
ask
you
to
wait
here
for
an
instant
have
question
which
should
like
to
put
to
the
maid
must
say
that
am
rather
disappointed
in
our
london
consultant
said
colonel
ross
bluntly
as
my
friend
left
the
room
do
not
see
that
we
are
any
further
than
when
he
came
at
least
you
have
his
assurance
that
your
horse
will
run
said
yes
have
his
assurance
said
the
colonel
with
shrug
of
his
shoulders
should
prefer
to
have
the
horse
was
about
to
make
some
reply
in
defence
of
my
friend
when
he
entered
the
room
again
now
gentlemen
said
he
am
quite
ready
for
tavistock
as
we
stepped
into
the
carriage
one
of
the
stable
lads
held
the
door
open
for
us
sudden
idea
seemed
to
occur
to
holmes
for
he
leaned
forward
and
touched
the
lad
upon
the
sleeve
you
have
few
sheep
in
the
paddock
he
said
who
attends
to
them
do
sir
have
you
noticed
anything
amiss
with
them
of
late
well
sir
not
of
much
account
but
three
of
them
have
gone
lame
sir
could
see
that
holmes
was
extremely
pleased
for
he
chuckled
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
long
shot
watson
very
long
shot
said
he
pinching
my
arm
gregory
let
me
recommend
to
your
attention
this
singular
epidemic
among
the
sheep
drive
on
coachman
colonel
ross
still
wore
an
expression
which
showed
the
poor
opinion
which
he
had
formed
of
my
companion
ability
but
saw
by
the
inspector
face
that
his
attention
had
been
keenly
aroused
you
consider
that
to
be
important
he
asked
exceedingly
so
is
there
any
point
to
which
you
would
wish
to
draw
my
attention
to
the
curious
incident
of
the
dog
in
the
night
time
the
dog
did
nothing
in
the
night
time
that
was
the
curious
incident
remarked
sherlock
holmes
four
days
later
holmes
and
were
again
in
the
train
bound
for
winchester
to
see
the
race
for
the
wessex
cup
colonel
ross
met
us
by
appointment
outside
the
station
and
we
drove
in
his
drag
to
the
course
beyond
the
town
his
face
was
grave
and
his
manner
was
cold
in
the
extreme
have
seen
nothing
of
my
horse
said
he
suppose
that
you
would
know
him
when
you
saw
him
asked
holmes
the
colonel
was
very
angry
have
been
on
the
turf
for
twenty
years
and
never
was
asked
such
question
as
that
before
said
he
child
would
know
silver
blaze
with
his
white
forehead
and
his
mottled
off
foreleg
how
is
the
betting
well
that
is
the
curious
part
of
it
you
could
have
got
fifteen
to
one
yesterday
but
the
price
has
become
shorter
and
shorter
until
you
can
hardly
get
three
to
one
now
hum
said
holmes
somebody
knows
something
that
is
clear
as
the
drag
drew
up
in
the
enclosure

the
grand
stand

as

powerful

swept
out
from

and
cantered
past
us
bearing
on
it
back
the
well
known
black
and
red
of
the
colonel
that
not
my
horse
cried
the
owner
that
beast
has
not
white
hair
upon
its
body
what
is
this
that
you
have
done
mr
holmes
well
let
us
see
how
he
gets
on
said
my
friend
imperturbably
for
few
minutes
he
gazed
through
my
field
glass
capital
an
excellent
start
he
cried
suddenly
there
they
are
coming
round
the
curve
from
our
drag
we
had
superb
view
as
they
came
up
the
straight
the
six
horses
were
so
close
together
that
carpet
could
have
covered
them
but
half
way
up
the
yellow
of
the
mapleton
stable
showed
to
the
front
before
they
reached
us
however
desborough
bolt
was
shot
and
the
colonel
horse
coming
away
with
rush
passed
the
post
good
six
lengths
before
its
rival
the
duke
of
balmoral
iris
making
bad
third
it
my
race
anyhow
gasped
the
colonel
passing
his
hand
over
his
eyes
confess
that
can
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
it
don
you
think
that
you
have
kept
up
your
mystery
long
enough
mr
holmes
certainly
colonel
you
shall
know
everything
let
us
all
go
round
and
have
look
at
the
horse
together
here
he
is
he
continued
as
we
made
our
way
into
the
weighing
enclosure
where
only
owners
and
their
friends
find
admittance
you
have
only
to
wash
his
face
and
his
leg
in
spirits
of
wine
and
you
will
find
that
he
is
the
same
old
silver
blaze
as
ever
you
take
my
breath
away
found
him
in
the
hands
of
fakir
and
took
the
liberty
of
running
him
just
as
he
was
sent
over
my
dear
sir
you
have
done
wonders
the
horse
looks
very
fit
and
well
it
never
went
better
in
its
life
owe
you
thousand
apologies
for
having
doubted
your
ability
you
have
done
me
great
service
by
recovering
my
horse
you
would
do
me
greater
still
if
you
could
lay
your
hands
on
the
murderer
of
john
straker
have
done
so
said
holmes
quietly
the
colonel
and
stared
at
him
in
amazement
you
have
got
him
where
is
he
then
he
is
here
where
in
my
company
at
the
present
moment
the
colonel
flushed
angrily
quite
recognize
that
am
under
obligations
to
you
mr
holmes
said
he
but
must
regard
what
you
have
just
said
as
either
very
bad
joke
or
an
insult
sherlock
holmes
laughed
assure
you
that
have
not
associated
you
with
the
crime
colonel
said
he
the
real
murderer
is
standing
immediately
behind
you
he
stepped
past
and
laid
his
hand
upon
the
glossy
neck
of
the
thoroughbred
the
horse
cried
both
the
colonel
and
myself
yes
the
horse
and
it
may
lessen
his
guilt
if
say
that
it
was
done
in
self
defence
and
that
john
straker
was
man
who
was
entirely
unworthy
of
your
confidence
but
there
goes
the
bell
and
as
stand
to
win
little
on
this
next
race
shall
defer
lengthy
explanation
until
more
fitting
time
we
had
the
corner
of
pullman
car
to
ourselves
that
evening
as
we
whirled
back
to
london
and
fancy
that
the
journey
was
short
one
to
colonel
ross
as
well
as
to
myself
as
we
listened
to
our
companion
narrative
of
the
events
which
had
occurred
at
the
dartmoor
training
stables
upon
the
monday
night
and
the
means
by
which
he
had
unravelled
them
confess
said
he
that
any
theories
which
had
formed
from
the
newspaper
reports
were
entirely
erroneous
and
yet
there
were
indications
there
had
they
not
been
overlaid
by
other
details
which
concealed
their
true
import
went
to
devonshire
with
the
conviction
that
fitzroy
simpson
was
the
true
culprit
although
of
course
saw
that
the
evidence
against
him
was
by
no
means
complete
it
was
while
was
in
the
carriage
just
as
we
reached
the
trainer
house
that
the
immense
significance
of
the
curried
mutton
occurred
to
me
you
may
remember
that
was
distrait
and
remained
sitting
after
you
had
all
alighted
was
marvelling
in
my
own
mind
how
could
possibly
have
overlooked
so
obvious
clue
confess
said
the
colonel
that
even
now
cannot
see
how
it
helps
us
it
was
the
first
link
in
my
chain
of
reasoning
powdered
opium
is
by
no
means
tasteless
the
flavor
is
not
disagreeable
but
it
is
perceptible
were
it
mixed
with
any
ordinary
dish
the
eater
would
undoubtedly
detect
it
and
would
probably
eat
no
more
curry
was
exactly
the
medium
which
would
disguise
this
taste
by
no
possible
supposition
could
this
stranger
fitzroy
simpson
have
caused
curry
to
be
served
in
the
trainer
family
that
night
and
it
is
surely
too
monstrous
coincidence
to
suppose
that
he
happened
to
come
along
with
powdered
opium
upon
the
very
night
when
dish
happened
to
be
served
which
would
disguise
the
flavor
that
is
unthinkable
therefore
simpson
becomes
eliminated
from
the
case
and
our
attention
centers
upon
straker
and
his
wife
the
only
two
people
who
could
have
chosen
curried
mutton
for
supper
that
night
the
opium
was
added
after
the
dish
was
set
aside
for
the
stable
boy
for
the
others
had
the
same
for
supper
with
no
ill
effects
which
of
them
then
had
access
to
that
dish
without
the
maid
seeing
them

before
deciding
that
question
had
grasped
the
significance
of
the
silence
of
the
dog
for
one
true
inference
invariably
suggests
others
the
simpson
incident
had
shown
me
that
dog
was
kept
in
the
stables
and
yet
though
some
one
had
been
in
and
had
fetched
out
horse
he
had
not
barked
enough
to
arouse
the
two
lads
in
the
loft
obviously
the
midnight
visitor
was
some
one
whom
the
dog
knew
well
was
already
convinced
or
almost
convinced
that
john
straker
went
down
to
the
stables
in
the
dead
of
the
night
and
took
out
silver
blaze
for
what
purpose
for
dishonest
one
obviously
or
why
should
he
drug
his
own
stable
boy
and
yet
was
at
loss
to
know
why
there
have
been
cases
before
now
where
trainers
have
made
sure
of
great
sums
of
money
by
laying
against
their
own
horses
through
agents
and
then
preventing
them
from
winning
by
fraud
sometimes
it
is
pulling
jockey
sometimes
it
is
some
surer
and
subtler
means
what
was
it
here
hoped
that
the
contents
of
his
pockets
might
help
me
to
form
conclusion
and
they
did
so
you
cannot
have
forgotten
the
singular
knife
which
was
found
in
the
dead
man
hand
knife
which
certainly
no
sane
man
would
choose
for
weapon
it
was
as
dr
watson
told
us
form
of
knife
which
is
used
for
the
most
delicate
operations
known
in
surgery
and
it
was
to
be
used
for
delicate
operation
that
night
you
must
know
with
your
wide
experience
of
turf
matters
colonel
ross
that
it
is
possible
to
make
slight
nick
upon
the
tendons
of
horse
ham
and
to
do
it
subcutaneously
so
as
to
leave
absolutely
no
trace
horse
so
treated
would
develop
slight
lameness
which
would
be
put
down
to
strain
in
exercise
or
touch
of
rheumatism
but
never
to
foul
play
villain
scoundrel
cried
the
colonel
we
have
here
the
explanation
of
why
john
straker
wished
to
take
the
horse
out
on
to
the
moor
so
spirited
creature
would
have
certainly
roused
the
soundest
of
sleepers
when
it
felt
the
prick
of
the
knife
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
do
it
in
the
open
air
have
been
blind
cried
the
colonel
of
course
that
was
why
he
needed
the
candle
and
struck
the
match
undoubtedly
but
in
examining
his
belongings
was
fortunate
enough
to
discover
not
only
the
method
of
the
crime
but
even
its
motives
as
man
of
the
world
colonel
you
know
that
men
do
not
carry
other
people
bills
about
in
their
pockets
we
have
most
of
us
quite
enough
to
do
to
settle
our
own
at
once
concluded
that
straker
was
leading
double
life
and
keeping
second
establishment
the
nature
of
the
bill
showed
that
there
was
lady
in
the
case
and
one
who
had
expensive
tastes
liberal
as
you
are
with
your
servants
one
can
hardly
expect
that
they
can
buy
twenty
guinea
walking
dresses
for
their
ladies
questioned
mrs
straker
as
to
the
dress
without
her
knowing
it
and
having
satisfied
myself
that
it
had
never
reached
her
made
note
of
the
milliner
address
and
felt
that
by
calling
there
with
straker
photograph
could
easily
dispose
of
the
mythical
derbyshire
from
that
time
on
all
was
plain
straker
had
led
out
the
horse
to
hollow
where
his
light
would
be
invisible
simpson
in
his
flight
had
dropped
his
cravat
and
straker
had
picked
it
up
with
some
idea
perhaps
that
he
might
use
it
in
securing
the
horse
leg
once
in
the
hollow
he
had
got
behind
the
horse
and
had
struck
light
but
the
creature
frightened
at
the
sudden
glare
and
with
the
strange
instinct
of
animals
feeling
that
some
mischief
was
intended
had
lashed
out
and
the
steel
shoe
had
struck
straker
full
on
the
forehead
he
had
already
in
spite
of
the
rain
taken
off
his
overcoat
in
order
to
do
his
delicate
task
and
so
as
he
fell
his
knife
gashed
his
thigh
do
make
it
clear
wonderful
cried
the
colonel
wonderful
you
might
have
been
there
my
final
shot
was
confess
very
long
one
it
struck
me
that
so
astute
man
as
straker
would
not
undertake
this
delicate
tendon
nicking
without
little
practice
what
could
he
practice
on
my
eyes
fell
upon
the
sheep
and
asked
question
which
rather
to
my
surprise
showed
that
my
surmise
was
correct
when
returned
to
london
called
upon
the
milliner
who
had
recognized
straker
as
an
excellent
customer
of
the
name
of
derbyshire
who
had
very
dashing
wife
with
strong
partiality
for
expensive
dresses
have
no
doubt
that
this
woman
had
plunged
him
over
head
and
ears
in
debt
and
so
led
him
into
this
miserable
plot
you
have
explained
all
but
one
thing
cried
the
colonel
where
was
the
horse
ah
it
bolted
and
was
cared
for
by
one
of
your
neighbors
we
must
have
an
amnesty
in
that
direction
think
this
is
clapham
junction
if
am
not
mistaken
and
we
shall
be
in
victoria
in
less
than
ten
minutes
if
you
care
to
smoke
cigar
in
our
rooms
colonel
shall
be
happy
to
give
you
any
other
details
which
might
interest
you
ii
the
yellow
face
in
publishing
these
short
sketches
based
upon
the
numerous
cases
in
which
my
companion
singular
gifts
have
made
us
the
listeners
to
and
eventually
the
actors
in
some
strange
drama
it
is
only
natural
that
should
dwell
rather
upon
his
successes
than
upon
his
failures
and
this
not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
his
reputations
for
indeed
it
was
when
he
was
at
his
wits
end
that
his
energy
and
his
versatility
were
most
admirable
but
because
where
he
failed
it
happened
too
often
that
no
one
else
succeeded
and
that
the
tale
was
left
forever
without
conclusion
now
and
again
however
it
chanced
that
even
when
he
erred
the
truth
was
still
discovered
have
noted
of
some
half
dozen
cases
of
the
kind
the
adventure
of
the
musgrave
ritual
and
that
which
am
about
to
recount
are
the
two
which
present
the
strongest
features
of
interest
sherlock
holmes
was
man
who
seldom
took
exercise
for
exercise
sake
few
men
were
capable
of
greater
muscular
effort
and
he
was
undoubtedly
one
of
the
finest
boxers
of
his
weight
that
have
ever
seen
but
he
looked
upon
aimless
bodily
exertion
as
waste
of
energy
and
he
seldom
bestirred
himself
save
when
there
was
some
professional
object
to
be
served
then
he
was
absolutely
untiring
and
indefatigable
that
he
should
have
kept
himself
in
training
under
such
circumstances
is
remarkable
but
his
diet
was
usually
of
the
sparest
and
his
habits
were
simple
to
the
verge
of
austerity
save
for
the
occasional
use
of
cocaine
he
had
no
vices
and
he
only
turned
to
the
drug
as
protest
against
the
monotony
of
existence
when
cases
were
scanty
and
the
papers
uninteresting
one
day
in
early
spring
he
had
so
fare
relaxed
as
to
go
for
walk
with
me
in
the
park
where
the
first
faint
shoots
of
green
were
breaking
out
upon
the
elms
and
the
sticky
spear
heads
of
the
chestnuts
were
just
beginning
to
burst
into
their
five
fold
leaves
for
two
hours
we
rambled
about
together
in
silence
for
the
most
part
as
befits
two
men
who
know
each
other
intimately
it
was
nearly
five
before
we
were
back
in
baker
street
once
more
beg
pardon
sir
said
our
page
boy
as
he
opened
the
door
there
been
gentleman
here
asking
for
you
sir
holmes
glanced
reproachfully
at
me
so
much
for
afternoon
walks
said
he
has
this
gentleman
gone
then
yes
sir
didn
you
ask
him
in
yes
sir
he
came
in
how
long
did
he
wait
half
an
hour
sir
he
was
very
restless
gentleman
sir
walkin
and
stampin
all
the
time
he
was
here
was
waitin
outside
the
door
sir
and
could
hear
him
at
last
he
out
into
the
passage
and
he
cries
is
that
man
never
goin
to
come
those
were
his
very
words
sir
you
ll
only
need
to
wait
little
longer
says
then
ll
wait
in
the
open
air
for
feel
half
choked
says
he
ll
be
back
before
long
and
with
that
he
ups
and
he
outs
and
all
could
say
wouldn
hold
him
back
well
you
did
you
best
said
holmes
as
we
walked
into
our
room
it
very
annoying
though
watson
was
badly
in
need
of
case
and
this
looks
from
the
man
impatience
as
if
it
were
of
importance
hullo
that
not
your
pipe
on
the
table
he
must
have
left
his
behind
him
nice
old
brier
with
good
long
stem
of
what
the
tobacconists
call
amber
wonder
how
many
real
amber
mouthpieces
there
are
in
london
some
people
think
that
fly
in
it
is
sign
well
he
must
have
been
disturbed
in
his
mind
to
leave
pipe
behind
him
which
he
evidently
values
highly
how
do
you
know
that
he
values
it
highly
asked
well
should
put
the
original
cost
of
the
pipe
at
seven
and
sixpence
now
it
has
you
see
been
twice
mended
once
in
the
wooden
stem
and
once
in
the
amber
each
of
these
mends
done
as
you
observe
with
silver
bands
must
have
cost
more
than
the
pipe
did
originally
the
man
must
value
the
pipe
highly
when
he
prefers
to
patch
it
up
rather
than
buy
new
one
with
the
same
money
anything
else
asked
for
holmes
was
turning
the
pipe
about
in
his
hand
and
staring
at
it
in
his
peculiar
pensive
way

he
held
it
up
and
tapped
on
it
with
his
long
thin
fore
finger
as
professor
might
who
was
lecturing
on
bone
pipes
are
occasionally
of
extraordinary
interest
said
he
nothing
has
more
individuality
save
perhaps
watches
and
bootlaces
the
indications
here
however
are
neither
very
marked
nor
very
important
the
owner
is
obviously
muscular
man
left
handed
with
an
excellent
set
of
teeth
careless
in
his
habits
and
with
no
need
to
practise
economy
my
friend
threw
out
the
information
in
very
offhand
way
but
saw
that
he
cocked
his
eye
at
me
to
see
if
had
followed
his
reasoning
you
think
man
must
be
well
to
do
if
he
smokes
seven
shilling
pipe
said
this
is
grosvenor
mixture
at
eightpence
an
ounce
holmes
answered
knocking
little
out
on
his
palm
as
he
might
get
an
excellent
smoke
for
half
the
price
he
has
no
need
to
practise
economy
and
the
other
points
he
has
been
in
the
habit
of
lighting
his
pipe
at
lamps
and
gas
jets
you
can
see
that
it
is
quite
charred
all
down
one
side
of
course
match
could
not
have
done
that
why
should
man
hold
match
to
the
side
of
his
pipe
but
you
cannot
light
it
at
lamp
without
getting
the
bowl
charred
and
it
is
all
on
the
right
side
of
the
pipe
from
that
gather
that
he
is
left
handed
man
you
hold
your
own
pipe
to
the
lamp
and
see
how
naturally
you
being
right
handed
hold
the
left
side
to
the
flame
you
might
do
it
once
the
other
way
but
not
as
constancy
this
has
always
been
held
so
then
he
has
bitten
through
his
amber
it
takes
muscular
energetic
fellow
and
one
with
good
set
of
teeth
to
do
that
but
if
am
not
mistaken
hear
him
upon
the
stair
so
we
shall
have
something
more
interesting
than
his
pipe
to
study
an
instant
later
our
door
opened
and
tall
young
man
entered
the
room
he
was
well
but
quietly
dressed
in
dark
grey
suit
and
carried
brown
wide
awake
in
his
hand
should
have
put
him
at
about
thirty
though
he
was
really
some
years
older
beg
your
pardon
said
he
with
some
embarrassment
suppose
should
have
knocked
yes
of
course
should
have
knocked
the
fact
is
that
am
little
upset
and
you
must
put
it
all
down
to
that
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
like
man
who
is
half
dazed
and
then
fell
rather
than
sat
down
upon
chair
can
see
that
you
have
not
slept
for
night
or
two
said
holmes
in
his
easy
genial
way
that
tries
man
nerves
more
than
work
and
more
even
than
pleasure
may
ask
how
can
help
you
wanted
your
advice
sir
don
know
what
to
do
and
my
whole
life
seems
to
have
gone
to
pieces
you
wish
to
employ
me
as
consulting
detective
not
that
only
want
your
opinion
as
judicious
man
as
man
of
the
world
want
to
know
what
ought
to
do
next
hope
to
god
you
ll
be
able
to
tell
me
he
spoke
in
little
sharp
jerky
outbursts
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
to
speak
at
all
was
very
painful
to
him
and
that
his
will
all
through
was
overriding
his
inclinations
it
very
delicate
thing
said
he
one
does
not
like
to
speak
of
one
domestic
affairs
to
strangers
it
seems
dreadful
to
discuss
the
conduct
of
one
wife
with
two
men
whom
have
never
seen
before
it
horrible
to
have
to
do
it
but
ve
got
to
the
end
of
my
tether
and
must
have
advice
my
dear
mr
grant
munro—
began
holmes
our
visitor
sprang
from
his
char
what
he
cried
you
know
my
mane
if
you
wish
to
preserve
your
incognito
said
holmes
smiling
would
suggest
that
you
cease
to
write
your
name
upon
the
lining
of
your
hat
or
else
that
you
turn
the
crown
towards
the
person
whom
you
are
addressing
was
about
to
say
that
my
friend
and
have
listened
to
good
many
strange
secrets
in
this
room
and
that
we
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
bring
peace
to
many
troubled
souls
trust
that
we
may
do
as
much
for
you
might
beg
you
as
time
may
prove
to
be
of
importance
to
furnish
me
with
the
facts
of
your
case
without
further
delay
our
visitor
again
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
as
if
he
found
it
bitterly
hard
from
every
gesture
and
expression
could
see
that
he
was
reserved
self
contained
man
with
dash
of
pride
in
his
nature
more
likely
to
hide
his
wounds
than
to
expose
them
then
suddenly
with
fierce
gesture
of
his
closed
hand
like
one
who
throws
reserve
to
the
winds
he
began
the
facts
are
these
mr
holmes
said
he
am
married
man
and
have
been
so
for
three
years
during
that
time
my
wife
and
have
loved
each
other
as
fondly
and
lived
as
happily
as
any
two
that
ever
were
joined
we
have
not
had
difference
not
one
in
thought
or
word
or
deed
and
now
since
last
monday
there
has
suddenly
sprung
up
barrier
between
us
and
find
that
there
is
something
in
her
life
and
in
her
thought
of
which
know
as
little
as
if
she
were
the
woman
who
brushes
by
me
in
the
street
we
are
estranged
and
want
to
know
why
now
there
is
one
thing
that
want
to
impress
upon
you
before
go
any
further
mr
holmes
effie
loves
me
don
let
there
be
any
mistake
about
that
she
loves
me
with
her
whole
heart
and
soul
and
never
more
than
now
know
it
feel
it
don
want
to
argue
about
that
man
can
tell
easily
enough
when
woman
loves
him
but
there
this
secret
between
us
and
we
can
never
be
the
same
until
it
is
cleared
kindly
let
me
have
the
facts
mr
munro
said
holmes
with
some
impatience
ll
tell
you
what
know
about
effie
history
she
was
widow
when
met
her
first
though
quite
young
only
twenty
five
her
name
then
was
mrs
hebron
she
went
out
to
america
when
she
was
young
and
lived
in
the
town
of
atlanta
where
she
married
this
hebron
who
was
lawyer
with
good
practice
they
had
one
child
but
the
yellow
fever
broke
out
badly
in
the
place
and
both
husband
and
child
died
of
it
have
seen
his
death
certificate
this
sickened
her
of
america
and
she
came
back
to
live
with
maiden
aunt
at
pinner
in
middlesex
may
mention
that
her
husband
had
left
her
comfortably
off
and
that
she
had
capital
of
about
four
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
which
had
been
so
well
invested
by
him
that
it
returned
an
average
of
seven
per
cent
she
had
only
been
six
months
at
pinner
when
met
her
we
fell
in
love
with
each
other
and
we
married
few
weeks
afterwards
am
hop
merchant
myself
and
as
have
an
income
of
seven
or
eight
hundred
we
found
ourselves
comfortably
off
and
took
nice
eighty
pound
year
villa
at
norbury
our
little
place
was
very
countrified
considering
that
it
is
so
close
to
town
we
had
an
inn
and
two
houses
little
above
us
and
single
cottage
at
the
other
side
of
the
field
which
faces
us
and
except
those
there
were
no
houses
until
you
got
half
way
to
the
station
my
business
took
me
into
town
at
certain
seasons
but
in
summer
had
less
to
do
and
then
in
our
country
home
my
wife
and
were
just
as
happy
as
could
be
wished
tell
you
that
there
never
was
shadow
between
us
until
this
accursed
affair
began
there
one
thing
ought
to
tell
you
before
go
further
when
we
married
my
wife
made
over
all
her
property
to
me
rather
against
my
will
for
saw
how
awkward
it
would
be
if
my
business
affairs
went
wrong
however
she
would
have
it
so
and
it
was
done
well
about
six
weeks
ago
she
came
to
me
jack
said
she
when
you
took
my
money
you
said
that
if
ever
wanted
any
was
to
ask
you
for
it
certainly
said
it
all
your
own
well
said
she
want
hundred
pounds
was
bit
staggered
at
this
for
had
imagined
it
was
simply
new
dress
or
something
of
the
kind
that
she
was
after
what
on
earth
for
asked
oh
said
she
in
her
playful
way
you
said
that
you
were
only
my
banker
and
bankers
never
ask
questions
you
know
if
you
really
mean
it
of
course
you
shall
have
the
money
said
oh
yes
really
mean
it
and
you
won
tell
me
what
you
want
it
for
some
day
perhaps
but
not
just
at
present
jack
so
had
to
be
content
with
that
thought
it
was
the
first
time
that
there
had
ever
been
any
secret
between
us
gave
her
check
and
never
thought
any
more
of
the
matter
it
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
what
came
afterwards
but
thought
it
only
right
to
mention
it
well
told
you
just
now
that
there
is
cottage
not
far
from
our
house
there
is
just
field
between
us
but
to
reach
it
you
have
to
go
along
the
road
and
then
turn
down
lane
just
beyond
it
is
nice
little
grove
of
scotch
firs
and
used
to
be
very
fond
of
strolling
down
there
for
trees
are
always
neighborly
kind
of
things
the
cottage
had
been
standing
empty
this
eight
months
and
it
was
pity
for
it
was
pretty
two
storied
place
with
an
old
fashioned
porch
and
honeysuckle
about
it
have
stood
many
time
and
thought
what
neat
little
homestead
it
would
make
well
last
monday
evening
was
taking
stroll
down
that
way
when
met
an
empty
van
coming
up
the
lane
and
saw
pile
of
carpets
and
things
lying
about
on
the
grass
plot
beside
the
porch
it
was
clear
that
the
cottage
had
at
last
been
let
walked
past
it
and
wondered
what
sort
of
folk
they
were
who
had
come
to
live
so
near
us
and
as
looked
suddenly
became
aware
that
face
was
watching
me
out
of
one
of
the
upper
windows

don
know
what
there
was
about
that
face
mr
holmes
but
it
seemed
to
send
chill
right
down
my
back
was
some
little
way
off
so
that
could
not
make
out
the
features
but
there
was
something
unnatural
and
inhuman
about
the
face
that
was
the
impression
that
had
and
moved
quickly
forwards
to
get
nearer
view
of
the
person
who
was
watching
me
but
as
did
so
the
face
suddenly
disappeared
so
suddenly
that
it
seemed
to
have
been
plucked
away
into
the
darkness
of
the
room
stood
for
five
minutes
thinking
the
business
over
and
trying
to
analyze
my
impressions
could
not
tell
if
the
face
were
that
of
man
or
woman
it
had
been
too
far
from
me
for
that
but
its
colour
was
what
had
impressed
me
most
it
was
of
livid
chalky
white
and
with
something
set
and
rigid
about
it
which
was
shockingly
unnatural
so
disturbed
was
that
determined
to
see
little
more
of
the
new
inmates
of
the
cottage
approached
and
knocked
at
the
door
which
was
instantly
opened
by
tall
gaunt
woman
with
harsh
forbidding
face
what
may
you
be
wantin
she
asked
in
northern
accent
am
your
neighbor
over
yonder
said
nodding
towards
my
house
see
that
you
have
only
just
moved
in
so
thought
that
if
could
be
of
any
help
to
you
in
any—
ay
we
ll
just
ask
ye
when
we
want
ye
said
she
and
shut
the
door
in
my
face
annoyed
at
the
churlish
rebuff
turned
my
back
and
walked
home
all
evening
though
tried
to
think
of
other
things
my
mind
would
still
turn
to
the
apparition
at
the
window
and
the
rudeness
of
the
woman
determined
to
say
nothing
about
the
former
to
my
wife
for
she
is
nervous
highly
strung
woman
and
had
no
wish
that
she
would
share
the
unpleasant
impression
which
had
been
produced
upon
myself
remarked
to
her
however
before
fell
asleep
that
the
cottage
was
now
occupied
to
which
she
returned
no
reply
am
usually
an
extremely
sound
sleeper
it
has
been
standing
jest
in
the
family
that
nothing
could
ever
wake
me
during
the
night
and
yet
somehow
on
that
particular
night
whether
it
may
have
been
the
slight
excitement
produced
by
my
little
adventure
or
not
know
not
but
slept
much
more
lightly
than
usual
half
in
my
dreams
was
dimly
conscious
that
something
was
going
on
in
the
room
and
gradually
became
aware
that
my
wife
had
dressed
herself
and
was
slipping
on
her
mantle
and
her
bonnet
my
lips
were
parted
to
murmur
out
some
sleepy
words
of
surprise
or
remonstrance
at
this
untimely
preparation
when
suddenly
my
half
opened
eyes
fell
upon
her
face
illuminated
by
the
candle
light
and
astonishment
held
me
dumb
she
wore
an
expression
such
as
had
never
seen
before
such
as
should
have
thought
her
incapable
of
assuming
she
was
deadly
pale
and
breathing
fast
glancing
furtively
towards
the
bed
as
she
fastened
her
mantle
to
see
if
she
had
disturbed
me
then
thinking
that
was
still
asleep
she
slipped
noiselessly
from
the
room
and
an
instant
later
heard
sharp
creaking
which
could
only
come
from
the
hinges
of
the
front
door
sat
up
in
bed
and
rapped
my
knuckles
against
the
rail
to
make
certain
that
was
truly
awake
then
took
my
watch
from
under
the
pillow
it
was
three
in
the
morning
what
on
this
earth
could
my
wife
be
doing
out
on
the
country
road
at
three
in
the
morning
had
sat
for
about
twenty
minutes
turning
the
thing
over
in
my
mind
and
trying
to
find
some
possible
explanation
the
more
thought
the
ore
extraordinary
and
inexplicable
did
it
appear
was
still
puzzling
over
it
when
heard
the
door
gently
close
again
and
her
footsteps
coming
up
the
stairs
where
in
the
world
have
you
been
effie
asked
as
she
entered
she
gave
violent
start
and
kind
of
gasping
cry
when
spoke
and
that
cry
and
start
troubled
me
more
than
all
the
rest
for
there
was
something
indescribably
guilty
about
them
my
wife
had
always
been
woman
of
frank
open
nature
and
it
gave
me
chill
to
see
her
slinking
into
her
own
room
and
crying
out
and
wincing
when
her
own
husband
spoke
to
her
you
awake
jack
she
cried
with
nervous
laugh
why
thought
that
nothing
could
awake
you
where
have
you
been
asked
more
sternly
don
wonder
that
you
are
surprised
said
she
and
could
see
that
her
fingers
were
trembling
as
she
undid
the
fastenings
of
her
mantle
why
never
remember
having
done
such
thing
in
my
life
before
the
fact
is
that
felt
as
though
were
choking
and
had
perfect
longing
for
breath
of
fresh
air
really
think
that
should
have
fainted
if
had
not
gone
out
stood
at
the
door
for
few
minutes
and
now
am
quite
myself
again
all
the
time
that
she
was
telling
me
this
story
she
never
once
looked
in
my
direction
and
her
voice
was
quite
unlike
her
usual
tones
it
was
evident
to
me
that
she
was
saying
what
was
false
said
nothing
in
reply
but
turned
my
face
to
the
wall
sick
at
heart
with
my
mind
filled
with
thousand
venomous
doubts
and
suspicions
what
was
it
that
my
wife
was
concealing
from
me
where
had
she
been
during
that
strange
expedition
felt
that
should
have
no
peace
until
knew
and
yet
shrank
from
asking
her
again
after
once
she
had
told
me
what
was
false
all
the
rest
of
the
night
tossed
and
tumbled
framing
theory
after
theory
each
more
unlikely
than
the
last
should
have
gone
to
the
city
that
day
but
was
too
disturbed
in
my
mind
to
be
able
to
pay
attention
to
business
matters
my
wife
seemed
to
be
as
upset
as
myself
and
could
see
from
the
little
questioning
glances
which
she
kept
shooting
at
me
that
she
understood
that
disbelieved
her
statement
and
that
she
was
at
her
wits
end
what
to
do
we
hardly
exchanged
word
during
breakfast
and
immediately
afterwards
went
out
for
walk
that
might
think
the
matter
out
in
the
fresh
morning
air
went
as
far
as
the
crystal
palace
spent
an
hour
in
the
grounds
and
was
back
in
norbury
by
one
clock
it
happened
that
my
way
took
me
past
the
cottage
and
stopped
for
an
instant
to
look
at
the
windows
and
to
see
if
could
catch
glimpse
of
the
strange
face
which
had
looked
out
at
me
on
the
day
before
as
stood
there
imagine
my
surprise
mr
holmes
when
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
my
wife
walked
out
was
struck
dumb
with
astonishment
at
the
sight
of
her
but
my
emotions
were
nothing
to
those
which
showed
themselves
upon
her
face
when
our
eyes
met
she
seemed
for
an
instant
to
wish
to
shrink
back
inside
the
house
again
and
then
seeing
how
useless
all
concealment
must
be
she
came
forward
with
very
white
face
and
frightened
eyes
which
belied
the
smile
upon
her
lips
ah
jack
she
said
have
just
been
in
to
see
if
can
be
of
any
assistance
to
our
new
neighbors
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
jack
you
are
not
angry
with
me
so
said
this
is
where
you
went
during
the
night
what
do
you
mean
she
cried
you
came
here
am
sure
of
it
who
are
these
people
that
you
should
visit
them
at
such
an
hour
have
not
been
here
before
how
can
you
tell
me
what
you
know
is
false
cried
your
very
voice
changes
as
you
speak
when
have
ever
had
secret
from
you
shall
enter
that
cottage
and
shall
probe
the
matter
to
the
bottom
no
jack
for
god
sake
she
gasped
in
uncontrollable
emotion
then
as
approached
the
door
she
seized
my
sleeve
and
pulled
me
back
with
convulsive
strength
implore
you
not
to
do
this
jack
she
cried
swear
that
will
tell
you
everything
some
day
but
nothing
but
misery
can
come
of
it
if
you
enter
that
cottage
then
as
tried
to
shake
her
off
she
clung
to
me
in
frenzy
of
entreaty
trust
me
jack
she
cried
trust
me
only
this
once
you
will
never
have
cause
to
regret
it
you
know
that
would
not
have
secret
from
you
if
it
were
not
for
your
own
sake
our
whole
lives
are
at
stake
in
this
if
you
come
home
with
me
all
will
be
well
if
you
force
your
way
into
that
cottage
all
is
over
between
us
there
was
such
earnestness
such
despair
in
her
manner
that
her
words
arrested
me
and
stood
irresolute
before
the
door
will
trust
you
on
one
condition
and
on
one
condition
only
said
at
last
it
is
that
this
mystery
comes
to
an
end
from
now
you
are
at
liberty
to
preserve
your
secret
but
you
must
promise
me
that
there
shall
be
no
more
nightly
visits
no
more
doings
which
are
kept
from
my
knowledge
am
willing
to
forget
those
which
are
passed
if
you
will
promise
that
there
shall
be
no
more
in
the
future
was
sure
that
you
would
trust
me
she
cried
with
great
sigh
of
relief
it
shall
be
just
as
you
wish
come
away
oh
come
away
up
to
the
house
still
pulling
at
my
sleeve
she
led
me
away
from
the
cottage
as
we
went
glanced
back
and
there
was
that
yellow
livid
face
watching
us
out
of
the
upper
window
what
link
could
there
be
between
that
creature
and
my
wife
or
how
could
the
coarse
rough
woman
whom
had
seen
the
day
before
be
connected
with
her
it
was
strange
puzzle
and
yet
knew
that
my
mind
could
never
know
ease
again
until
had
solved
it

for
two
days
after
this
stayed
at
home
and
my
wife
appeared
to
abide
loyally
by
our
engagement
for
as
far
as
know
she
never
stirred
out
of
the
house
on
the
third
day
however
had
ample
evidence
that
her
solemn
promise
was
not
enough
to
hold
her
back
from
this
secret
influence
which
drew
her
away
from
her
husband
and
her
duty
had
gone
into
town
on
that
day
but
returned
by
the
40
instead
of
the
36
which
is
my
usual
train
as
entered
the
house
the
maid
ran
into
the
hall
with
startled
face
where
is
your
mistress
asked
think
that
she
has
gone
out
for
walk
she
answered
my
mind
was
instantly
filled
with
suspicion
rushed
upstairs
to
make
sure
that
she
was
not
in
the
house
as
did
so
happened
to
glance
out
of
one
of
the
upper
windows
and
saw
the
maid
with
whom
had
just
been
speaking
running
across
the
field
in
the
direction
of
the
cottage
then
of
course
saw
exactly
what
it
all
meant
my
wife
had
gone
over
there
and
had
asked
the
servant
to
call
her
if
should
return
tingling
with
anger
rushed
down
and
hurried
across
determined
to
end
the
matter
once
and
forever
saw
my
wife
and
the
maid
hurrying
back
along
the
lane
but
did
not
stop
to
speak
with
them
in
the
cottage
lay
the
secret
which
was
casting
shadow
over
my
life
vowed
that
come
what
might
it
should
be
secret
no
longer
did
not
even
knock
when
reached
it
but
turned
the
handle
and
rushed
into
the
passage
it
was
all
still
and
quiet
upon
the
ground
floor
in
the
kitchen
kettle
was
singing
on
the
fire
and
large
black
cat
lay
coiled
up
in
the
basket
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
woman
whom
had
seen
before
ran
into
the
other
room
but
it
was
equally
deserted
then
rushed
up
the
stairs
only
to
find
two
other
rooms
empty
and
deserted
at
the
top
there
was
no
one
at
all
in
the
whole
house
the
furniture
and
pictures
were
of
the
most
common
and
vulgar
description
save
in
the
one
chamber
at
the
window
of
which
had
seen
the
strange
face
that
was
comfortable
and
elegant
and
all
my
suspicions
rose
into
fierce
bitter
flame
when
saw
that
on
the
mantelpiece
stood
copy
of
fell
length
photograph
of
my
wife
which
had
been
taken
at
my
request
only
three
months
ago
stayed
long
enough
to
make
certain
that
the
house
was
absolutely
empty
then
left
it
feeling
weight
at
my
heart
such
as
had
never
had
before
my
wife
came
out
into
the
hall
as
entered
my
house
but
was
too
hurt
and
angry
to
speak
with
her
and
pushing
past
her
made
my
way
into
my
study
she
followed
me
however
before
could
close
the
door
am
sorry
that
broke
my
promise
jack
said
she
but
if
you
knew
all
the
circumstances
am
sure
that
you
would
forgive
me
tell
me
everything
then
said
cannot
jack
cannot
she
cried
until
you
tell
me
who
it
is
that
has
been
living
in
that
cottage
and
who
it
is
to
whom
you
have
given
that
photograph
there
can
never
be
any
confidence
between
us
said
and
breaking
away
from
her
left
the
house
that
was
yesterday
mr
holmes
and
have
not
seen
her
since
nor
do
know
anything
more
about
this
strange
business
it
is
the
first
shadow
that
has
come
between
us
and
it
has
so
shaken
me
that
do
not
know
what
should
do
for
the
best
suddenly
this
morning
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
were
the
man
to
advise
me
so
have
hurried
to
you
now
and
place
myself
unreservedly
in
your
hands
if
there
is
any
point
which
have
not
made
clear
pray
question
me
about
it
but
above
all
tell
me
quickly
what
am
to
do
for
this
misery
is
more
than
can
bear
holmes
and
had
listened
with
the
utmost
interest
to
this
extraordinary
statement
which
had
been
delivered
in
the
jerky
broken
fashion
of
man
who
is
under
the
influence
of
extreme
emotions
my
companion
sat
silent
for
some
time
with
his
chin
upon
his
hand
lost
in
thought
tell
me
said
he
at
last
could
you
swear
that
this
was
man
face
which
you
saw
at
the
window
each
time
that
saw
it
was
some
distance
away
from
it
so
that
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
you
appear
however
to
have
been
disagreeably
impressed
by
it
seemed
to
be
of
an
unnatural
colour
and
to
have
strange
rigidity
about
the
features
when
approached
it
vanished
with
jerk
how
long
is
it
since
your
wife
asked
you
for
hundred
pounds
nearly
two
months
have
you
ever
seen
photograph
of
her
first
husband
no
there
was
great
fire
at
atlanta
very
shortly
after
his
death
and
all
her
papers
were
destroyed
and
yet
she
had
certificate
of
death
you
say
that
you
saw
it
yes
she
got
duplicate
after
the
fire
did
you
ever
meet
any
one
who
knew
her
in
america
no
did
she
ever
talk
of
revisiting
the
place
no
or
get
letters
from
it
no
thank
you
should
like
to
think
over
the
matter
little
now
if
the
cottage
is
now
permanently
deserted
we
may
have
some
difficulty
if
on
the
other
hand
as
fancy
is
more
likely
the
inmates
were
warned
of
you
coming
and
left
before
you
entered
yesterday
then
they
may
be
back
now
and
we
should
clear
it
all
up
easily
let
me
advise
you
then
to
return
to
norbury
and
to
examine
the
windows
of
the
cottage
again
if
you
have
reason
to
believe
that
is
inhabited
do
not
force
your
way
in
but
send
wire
to
my
friend
and
me
we
shall
be
with
you
within
an
hour
of
receiving
it
and
we
shall
then
very
soon
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
business
and
if
it
is
still
empty
in
that
case
shall
come
out
to
morrow
and
talk
it
over
with
you
good
by
and
above
all
do
not
fret
until
you
know
that
you
really
have
cause
for
it
am
afraid
that
this
is
bad
business
watson
said
my
companion
as
he
returned
after
accompanying
mr
grant
munro
to
the
door
what
do
you
make
of
it
had
an
ugly
sound
answered
yes
there
blackmail
in
it
or
am
much
mistaken
and
who
is
the
blackmailer
well
it
must
be
the
creature
who
lives
in
the
only
comfortable
room
in
the
place
and
has
her
photograph
above
his
fireplace
upon
my
word
watson
there
is
something
very
attractive
about
that
livid
face
at
the
window
and
would
not
have
missed
the
case
for
worlds
you
have
theory
yes
provisional
one
but
shall
be
surprised
if
it
does
not
turn
out
to
be
correct
this
woman
first
husband
is
in
that
cottage
why
do
you
think
so
how
else
can
we
explain
her
frenzied
anxiety
that
her
second
one
should
not
enter
it
the
facts
as
read
them
are
something
like
this
woman
was
married
in
america
her
husband
developed
some
hateful
qualities
or
shall
we
say
that
he
contracted
some
loathsome
disease
and
became
leper
or
an
imbecile
she
flies
from
him
at
last
returns
to
england
changes
her
name
and
starts
her
life
as
she
thinks
afresh
she
has
been
married
three
years
and
believes
that
her
position
is
quite
secure
having
shown
her
husband
the
death
certificate
of
some
man
whose
name
she
has
assumed
when
suddenly
her
whereabouts
is
discovered
by
her
first
husband
or
we
may
suppose
by
some
unscrupulous
woman
who
has
attached
herself
to
the
invalid
they
write
to
the
wife
and
threaten
to
come
and
expose
her
she
asks
for
hundred
pounds
and
endeavors
to
buy
them
off
they
come
in
spite
of
it
and
when
the
husband
mentions
casually
to
the
wife
that
there
new
comers
in
the
cottage
she
knows
in
some
way
that
they
are
her
pursuers
she
waits
until
her
husband
is
asleep
and
then
she
rushes
down
to
endeavor
to
persuade
them
to
leave
her
in
peace
having
no
success
she
goes
again
next
morning
and
her
husband
meets
her
as
he
has
told
us
as
she
comes
out
she
promises
him
then
not
to
go
there
again
but
two
days
afterwards
the
hope
of
getting
rid
of
those
dreadful
neighbors
was
too
strong
for
her
and
she
made
another
attempt
taking
down
with
her
the
photograph
which
had
probably
been
demanded
from
her
in
the
midst
of
this
interview
the
maid
rushed
in
to
say
that
the
master
had
come
home
on
which
the
wife
knowing
that
he
would
come
straight
down
to
the
cottage
hurried
the
inmates
out
at
the
back
door
into
the
grove
of
fir
trees
probably
which
was
mentioned
as
standing
near
in
this
way
he
found
the
place
deserted
shall
be
very
much
surprised
however
if
it
still
so
when
he
reconnoitres
it
this
evening
what
do
you
think
of
my
theory
it
is
all
surmise
but
at
least
it
covers
all
the
facts
when
new
facts
come
to
our
knowledge
which
cannot
be
covered
by
it
will
be
time
enough
to
reconsider
it
we
can
do
nothing
more
until
we
have
message
from
our
friend
at
norbury
but
we
had
not
very
long
time
to
wait
for
that
it
came
just
as
we
had
finished
our
tea
the
cottage
is
still
tenanted
it
said
have
seen
the
face
again
at
the
window
will
meet
the
seven
clock
train
and
will
take
no
steps
until
you
arrive
he
was
waiting
on
the
platform
when
we
stepped
out
and
we
could
see
in
the
light
of
the
station
lamps
that
he
was
very
pale
and
quivering
with
agitation

they
are
still
there
mr
holmes
said
he
laying
his
hand
hard
upon
my
friend
sleeve
saw
lights
in
the
cottage
as
came
down
we
shall
settle
it
now
once
and
for
all
what
is
your
plan
then
asked
holmes
as
he
walked
down
the
dark
tree
lined
road
am
going
to
force
my
way
in
and
see
for
myself
who
is
in
the
house
wish
you
both
to
be
there
as
witnesses
you
are
quite
determined
to
do
this
in
spite
of
your
wife
warning
that
it
is
better
that
you
should
not
solve
the
mystery
yes
am
determined
well
think
that
you
are
in
the
right
any
truth
is
better
than
indefinite
doubt
we
had
better
go
up
at
once
of
course
legally
we
are
putting
ourselves
hopelessly
in
the
wrong
but
think
that
it
is
worth
it
was
very
dark
night
and
thin
rain
began
to
fall
as
we
turned
from
the
high
road
into
narrow
lane
deeply
rutted
with
hedges
on
either
side
mr
grant
munro
pushed
impatiently
forward
however
and
we
stumbled
after
him
as
best
we
could
there
are
the
lights
of
my
house
he
murmured
pointing
to
glimmer
among
the
trees
and
here
is
the
cottage
which
am
going
to
enter
we
turned
corner
in
the
lane
as
he
spoke
and
there
was
the
building
close
beside
us
yellow
bar
falling
across
the
black
foreground
showed
that
the
door
was
not
quite
closed
and
one
window
in
the
upper
story
was
brightly
illuminated
as
we
looked
we
saw
dark
blur
moving
across
the
blind
there
is
that
creature
cried
grant
munro
you
can
see
for
yourselves
that
some
one
is
there
now
follow
me
and
we
shall
soon
know
all
we
approached
the
door
but
suddenly
woman
appeared
out
of
the
shadow
and
stood
in
the
golden
track
of
the
lamp
light
could
not
see
her
face
in
the
he
darkness
but
her
arms
were
thrown
out
in
an
attitude
of
entreaty
for
god
sake
don
jack
she
cried
had
presentiment
that
you
would
come
this
evening
think
better
of
it
dear
trust
me
again
and
you
will
never
have
cause
to
regret
it
have
trusted
you
tool
long
effie
he
cried
sternly
leave
go
of
me
must
pass
you
my
friends
and
are
going
to
settle
this
matter
once
and
forever
he
pushed
her
to
one
side
and
we
followed
closely
after
him
as
he
threw
the
door
open
an
old
woman
ran
out
in
front
of
him
and
tried
to
bar
his
passage
but
he
thrust
her
back
and
an
instant
afterwards
we
were
all
upon
the
stairs
grant
munro
rushed
into
the
lighted
room
at
the
top
and
we
entered
at
his
heels
it
was
cosey
well
furnished
apartment
with
two
candles
burning
upon
the
table
and
two
upon
the
mantelpiece
in
the
corner
stooping
over
desk
there
sat
what
appeared
to
be
little
girl
her
face
was
turned
away
as
we
entered
but
we
could
see
that
she
was
dressed
in
red
frock
and
that
she
had
long
white
gloves
on
as
she
whisked
round
to
us
gave
cry
of
surprise
and
horror
the
face
which
she
turned
towards
us
was
of
the
strangest
livid
tint
and
the
features
were
absolutely
devoid
of
any
expression
an
instant
later
the
mystery
was
explained
holmes
with
laugh
passed
his
hand
behind
the
child
ear
mask
peeled
off
from
her
countenance
an
there
was
little
coal
black
negress
with
all
her
white
teeth
flashing
in
amusement
at
our
amazed
faces
burst
out
laughing
out
of
sympathy
with
her
merriment
but
grant
munro
stood
staring
with
his
hand
clutching
his
throat
my
god
he
cried
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
this
will
tell
you
the
meaning
of
it
cried
the
lady
sweeping
into
the
room
with
proud
set
face
you
have
forced
me
against
my
own
judgment
to
tell
you
and
now
we
must
both
make
the
best
of
it
my
husband
died
at
atlanta
my
child
survived
your
child
she
drew
large
silver
locket
from
her
bosom
you
have
never
seen
this
open
understood
that
it
did
not
open
she
touched
spring
and
the
front
hinged
back
there
was
portrait
within
of
man
strikingly
handsome
and
intelligent
looking
but
bearing
unmistakable
signs
upon
his
features
of
his
african
descent
that
is
john
hebron
of
atlanta
said
the
lady
and
nobler
man
never
walked
the
earth
cut
myself
off
from
my
race
in
order
to
wed
him
but
never
once
while
he
lived
did
for
an
instant
regret
it
was
our
misfortune
that
our
only
child
took
after
his
people
rather
than
mine
it
is
often
so
in
such
matches
and
little
lucy
is
darker
far
than
ever
her
father
was
but
dark
or
fair
she
is
my
own
dear
little
girlie
and
her
mother
pet
the
little
creature
ran
across
at
the
words
and
nestled
up
against
the
lady
dress
when
left
her
in
america
she
continued
it
was
only
because
her
health
was
weak
and
the
change
might
have
done
her
harm
she
was
given
to
the
care
of
faithful
scotch
woman
who
had
once
been
our
servant
never
for
an
instant
did
dream
of
disowning
her
as
my
child
but
when
chance
threw
you
in
my
way
jack
and
learned
to
love
you
feared
to
tell
you
about
my
child
god
forgive
me
feared
that
should
lose
you
and
had
not
the
courage
to
tell
you
had
to
choose
between
you
and
in
my
weakness
turned
away
from
my
own
little
girl
for
three
years
have
kept
her
existence
secret
from
you
but
heard
from
the
nurse
and
knew
that
all
was
well
with
her
at
last
however
there
came
an
overwhelming
desire
to
see
the
child
once
more
struggled
against
it
but
in
vain
though
knew
the
danger
determined
to
have
the
child
over
if
it
were
but
for
few
weeks
sent
hundred
pounds
to
the
nurse
and
gave
her
instructions
about
this
cottage
so
that
she
might
come
as
neighbor
without
my
appearing
to
be
in
any
way
connected
with
her
pushed
my
precautions
so
far
as
to
order
her
to
keep
the
child
in
the
house
during
the
daytime
and
to
cover
up
her
little
face
and
hands
so
that
even
those
who
might
see
her
at
the
window
should
not
gossip
about
there
being
black
child
in
the
neighborhood
if
had
been
less
cautious
might
have
been
more
wise
but
was
half
crazy
with
fear
that
you
should
learn
the
truth
it
was
you
who
told
me
first
that
the
cottage
was
occupied
should
have
waited
for
the
morning
but
could
not
sleep
for
excitement
and
so
at
last
slipped
out
knowing
how
difficult
it
is
to
awake
you
but
you
saw
me
go
and
that
was
the
beginning
of
my
troubles
next
day
you
had
my
secret
at
your
mercy
but
you
nobly
refrained
from
pursuing
your
advantage
three
days
later
however
the
nurse
and
child
only
just
escaped
from
the
back
door
as
you
rushed
in
at
the
front
one
and
now
to
night
you
at
last
know
all
and
ask
you
what
is
to
become
of
us
my
child
and
me
she
clasped
her
hands
and
waited
for
an
answer
it
was
long
ten
minutes
before
grant
munro
broke
the
silence
and
when
his
answer
came
it
was
one
of
which
love
to
think
he
lifted
the
little
child
kissed
her
and
then
still
carrying
her
he
held
his
other
hand
out
to
his
wife
and
turned
towards
the
door
we
can
talk
it
over
more
comfortably
at
home
said
he
am
not
very
good
man
effie
but
think
that
am
better
one
than
you
have
given
me
credit
for
being
holmes
and
followed
them
down
the
lane
and
my
friend
plucked
at
my
sleeve
as
we
came
out
think
said
he
that
we
shall
be
of
more
use
in
london
than
in
norbury
not
another
word
did
he
say
of
the
case
until
late
that
night
when
he
was
turning
away
with
his
lighted
candle
for
his
bedroom
watson
said
he
if
it
should
ever
strike
you
that
am
getting
little
over
confident
in
my
powers
or
giving
less
pains
to
case
than
it
deserves
kindly
whisper
norbury
in
my
ear
and
shall
be
infinitely
obliged
to
you

the

shortly
after
my
marriage
had
bought

in
the
paddington
district
old
mr
farquhar
from
whom
purchased
it
had
at
one
time
an
excellent
general
practice

age
and
an
affliction
of
the
nature
of
st
vitus
dance
from
which
he
suffered
had
very
much
thinned
it
the
public
not
unnaturally
goes
on
the
principle
that
he
who
would
heal
others
must
himself
be
whole
and
looks
askance
at
the
curative
powers
of
the
man
whose
own
case
is
beyond
the
reach
of
his
drugs
thus
as
my
predecessor
weakened
his
practice
declined
until
when
purchased
it
from
him
it
had
sunk
from
twelve
hundred
to
little
more
than
three
hundred
year
had
confidence
however
in
my
own
youth
and
energy
and
was
convinced
that
in
very
few
years
the
concern
would
be
as
flourishing
as
ever
for
three
months
after
taking
over
the
practice
was
kept
very
closely
at
work
and
saw
little
of
my
friend
sherlock
holmes
for
was
too
busy
to
visit
baker
street
and
he
seldom
went
anywhere
himself
save
upon
professional
business
was
surprised
therefore
when
one
morning
in
june
as
sat
reading
the
british
medical
journal
after
breakfast
heard
ring
at
the
bell
followed
by
the
high
somewhat
strident
tones
of
my
old
companion
voice
ah
my
dear
watson
said
he
striding
into
the
room
am
very
delighted
to
see
you
trust
that
mrs
watson
has
entirely
recovered
from
all
the
little
excitements
connected
with
our
adventure
of
the
sign

thank
you
we
are
both
very
well
said
shaking
him
warmly
by
the
hand
and
hope
also
he
continued
sitting
down
in
the
rocking
chair
that
the
cares
of
medical
practice
have
not
entirely
obliterated
the
interest
which
you
used
to
take
in
our
little
deductive
problems
on
the
contrary
answered
it
was
only
last
night
that
was
looking
over
my
old
notes
and
classifying
some
of
our
past
results
trust
that
you
don
consider
your
collection
closed
not
at
all
should
wish
nothing
better
than
to
have
some
more
of
such
experiences
to
day
for
example
yes
to
day
if
you
like
and
as
far
off
as
birmingham
certainly
if
you
wish
it
and
the
practice
do
my
neighbor
when
he
goes
he
is
always
ready
to
work
off
the
debt
ha
nothing
could
be
better
said
holmes
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
looking
keenly
at
me
from
under
his
half
closed
lids
perceive
that
you
have
been
unwell
lately
summer
colds
are
always
little
trying
was
confined
to
the
house
by
sever
chill
for
three
days
last
week
thought
however
that
had
cast
off
every
trace
of
it
so
you
have
you
look
remarkably
robust
how
then
did
you
know
of
it
my
dear
fellow
you
know
my
methods
you
deduced
it
then
certainly
and
from
what
from
your
slippers
glanced
down
at
the
new
patent
leathers
which
was
wearing
how
on
earth—
began
but
holmes
answered
my
question
before
it
was
asked
your
slippers
are
new
he
said
you
could
not
have
had
them
more
than
few
weeks
the
soles
which
you
are
at
this
moment
presenting
to
me
are
slightly
scorched
for
moment
thought
they
might
have
got
wet
and
been
burned
in
the
drying
but
near
the
instep
there
is
small
circular
wafer
of
paper
with
the
shopman
hieroglyphics
upon
it
damp
would
of
course
have
removed
this
you
had
then
been
sitting
with
our
feet
outstretched
to
the
fire
which
man
would
hardly
do
even
in
so
wet
june
as
this
if
he
were
in
his
full
health
like
all
holmes
reasoning
the
thing
seemed
simplicity
itself
when
it
was
once
explained
he
read
the
thought
upon
my
features
and
his
smile
had
tinge
of
bitterness
am
afraid
that
rather
give
myself
away
when
explain
said
he
results
without
causes
are
much
more
impressive
you
are
ready
to
come
to
birmingham
then
certainly
what
is
the
case
you
shall
hear
it
all
in
the
train
my
client
is
outside
in
four
wheeler
can
you
come
at
once
in
an
instant
scribbled
note
to
my
neighbor
rushed
upstairs
to
explain
the
matter
to
my
wife
and
joined
holmes
upon
the
door
step
your
neighbor
is
doctor
said
he
nodding
at
the
brass
plate
yes
he
bought
practice
as
did
an
old
established
one
just
the
same
as
mine
both
have
been
ever
since
the
houses
were
built
ah
then
you
got
hold
of
the
best
of
the
two
think
did
but
how
do
you
know
by
the
steps
my
boy
yours
are
worn
three
inches
deeper
than
his
but
this
gentleman
in
the
cab
is
my
client
mr
hall
pycroft
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
him
whip
your
horse
up
cabby
for
we
have
only
just
time
to
catch
our
train
the
man
whom
found
myself
facing
was
well
built
fresh
complexioned
young
fellow
with
frank
honest
face
and
slight
crisp
yellow
mustache
he
wore
very
shiny
top
hat
and
neat
suit
of
sober
black
which
made
him
look
what
he
was
smart
young
city
man
of
the
class
who
have
been
labeled
cockneys
but
who
give
us
our
crack
volunteer
regiments
and
who
turn
out
more
fine
athletes
and
sportsmen
than
any
body
of
men
in
these
islands
his
round
ruddy
face
was
naturally
full
of
cheeriness
but
the
corners
of
his
mouth
seemed
to
me
to
be
pulled
down
in
half
comical
distress
it
was
not
however
until
we
were
all
in
first
class
carriage
and
well
started
upon
our
journey
to
birmingham
that
was
able
to
learn
what
the
trouble
was
which
had
driven
him
to
sherlock
holmes
we
have
clear
run
here
of
seventy
minutes
holmes
remarked
want
you
mr
hall
pycroft
to
tell
my
friend
your
very
interesting
experience
exactly
as
you
have
told
it
to
me
or
with
more
detail
if
possible
it
will
be
of
use
to
me
to
hear
the
succession
of
events
again
it
is
case
watson
which
may
prove
to
have
something
in
it
or
may
prove
to
have
nothing
but
which
at
least
presents
those
unusual
and
outré
features
which
are
as
dear
to
you
as
they
are
to
me
now
mr
pycroft
shall
not
interrupt
you
again
our
young
companion
looked
at
me
with
twinkle
in
his
eye
the
worst
of
the
story
is
said
he
that
show
myself
up
as
such
confounded
fool
of
course
it
may
work
out
all
right
and
don
see
that
could
have
done
otherwise
but
if
have
lost
my
crib
and
get
nothing
in
exchange
shall
feel
what
soft
johnnie
have
been
not
very
good
at
telling
story
dr
watson
but
it
is
like
this
with
me
used
to
have
billet
at
coxon
woodhouse
of
draper
gardens
but
they
were
let
in
early
in
the
spring
through
the
venezuelan
loan
as
no
doubt
you
remember
and
came
nasty
cropper
had
been
with
them
five
years
and
old
coxon
gave
me
ripping
good
testimonial
when
the
smash
came
but
of
course
we
clerks
were
all
turned
adrift
the
twenty
seven
of
us
tried
here
and
tried
there
but
there
were
lots
of
other
chaps
on
the
same
lay
as
myself
and
it
was
perfect
frost
for
long
time
had
been
taking
three
pounds
week
at
coxon
and
had
saved
about
seventy
of
them
but
soon
worked
my
way
through
that
and
out
at
the
other
end
was
fairly
at
the
end
of
my
tether
at
last
and
could
hardly
find
the
stamps
to
answer
the
advertisements
or
the
envelopes
to
stick
them
to
had
worn
out
my
boots
paddling
up
office
stairs
and
seemed
just
as
far
from
getting
billet
as
ever
at
last
saw
vacancy
at
mawson
williams
the
great
stock
broking
firm
in
lombard
street
dare
say
is
not
much
in
your
line
but
can
tell
you
that
this
is
about
the
richest
house
in
london
the
advertisement
was
to
be
answered
by
letter
only
sent
in
my
testimonial
and
application
but
without
the
least
hope
of
getting
it
back
came
an
answer
by
return
saying
that
if
would
appear
next
monday
might
take
over
my
new
duties
at
once
provided
that
my
appearance
was
satisfactory
no
one
knows
how
these
things
are
worked
some
people
say
that
the
manager
just
plunges
his
hand
into
the
heap
and
takes
the
first
that
comes
anyhow
it
was
my
innings
that
time
and
don
ever
wish
to
feel
better
pleased
the
screw
was
pound
week
rise
and
the
duties
just
about
the
same
as
at
coxon
and
now
come
to
the
queer
part
of
the
business
was
in
diggings
out
hampstead
way
17
potter
terrace
well
was
sitting
doing
smoke
that
very
evening
after
had
been
promised
the
appointment
when
up
came
my
landlady
with
card
which
had
arthur
pinner
financial
agent
printed
upon
it
had
never
heard
the
name
before
and
could
not
imagine
what
he
wanted
with
me
but
of
course
asked
her
to
show
him
up
in
he
walked
middle
sized
dark
haired
dark
eyed
black
bearded
man
with
touch
of
the
sheeny
about
his
nose
he
had
brisk
kind
of
way
with
him
and
spoke
sharply
like
man
who
knew
the
value
of
time
mr
hall
pycroft
believe
said
he
yes
sir
answered
pushing
chair
towards
him
lately
engaged
at
coxon
woodhouse
yes
sir
and
now
on
the
staff
of
mawson
quite
so
well
said
he
the
fact
is
that
have
heard
some
really
extraordinary
stories
about
your
financial
ability
you
remember
parker
who
used
to
be
coxon
manager
he
can
never
say
enough
about
it
of
course
was
pleased
to
hear
this
had
always
been
pretty
sharp
in
the
office
but
had
never
dreamed
that
was
talked
about
in
the
city
in
this
fashion
you
have
good
memory
said
he
pretty
fair
answered
modestly
have
you
kept
in
touch
with
the
market
while
you
have
been
out
of
work
he
asked
yes
read
the
stock
exchange
list
every
morning
now
that
shows
real
application
he
cried
that
is
the
way
to
prosper
you
won
mind
my
testing
you
will
you
let
me
see
how
are
ayrshires
hundred
and
six
and
quarter
to
hundred
and
five
and
seven
eighths
and
new
zealand
consolidated
hundred
and
four
and
british
broken
hills
seven
to
seven
and
six
wonderful
he
cried
with
his
hands
up
this
quite
fits
in
with
all
that
had
heard
my
boy
my
boy
you
are
very
much
too
good
to
be
clerk
at
mawson
this
outburst
rather
astonished
me
as
you
can
think
well
said
other
people
don
think
quite
so
much
of
me
as
you
seem
to
do
mr
pinner
had
hard
enough
fight
to
get
this
berth
and
am
very
glad
to
have
it

pooh
man
you
should
soar
above
it
you
are
not
in
your
true
sphere
now
ll
tell
you
how
it
stands
with
me
what
have
to
offer
is
little
enough
when
measured
by
your
ability
but
when
compared
with
mawson
it
light
to
dark
let
me
see
when
do
you
go
to
mawson
on
monday
ha
think
would
risk
little
sporting
flutter
that
you
don
go
there
at
all
not
go
to
mawson
no
sir
by
that
day
you
will
be
the
business
manager
of
the
franco
midland
hardware
company
limited
with
hundred
and
thirty
four
branches
in
the
towns
and
villages
of
france
not
counting
one
in
brussels
and
one
in
san
remo
this
took
my
breath
away
never
heard
of
it
said
very
likely
not
it
has
been
kept
very
quiet
for
the
capital
was
all
privately
subscribed
and
it
too
good
thing
to
let
the
public
into
my
brother
harry
pinner
is
promoter
and
joins
the
board
after
allotment
as
managing
director
he
knew
was
in
the
swim
down
here
and
asked
me
to
pick
up
good
man
cheap
young
pushing
man
with
plenty
of
snap
about
him
parker
spoke
of
you
and
that
brought
me
here
tonight
we
can
only
offer
you
beggarly
five
hundred
to
start
with
five
hundred
year
shouted
only
that
at
the
beginning
but
you
are
to
have
an
overriding
commission
of
one
per
cent
on
all
business
done
by
your
agents
and
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
that
this
will
come
to
more
than
your
salary
but
know
nothing
about
hardware
tut
my
boy
you
know
about
figures
my
head
buzzed
and
could
hardly
sit
still
in
my
chair
but
suddenly
little
chill
of
doubt
came
upon
me
must
be
frank
with
you
said
mawson
only
gives
me
two
hundred
but
mawson
is
safe
now
really
know
so
little
about
your
company
that—
ah
smart
he
cried
in
kind
of
ecstasy
of
delight
you
are
the
very
man
for
us
you
are
not
to
be
talked
over
and
quite
right
too
now
here
note
for
hundred
pounds
and
if
you
think
that
we
can
do
business
you
may
just
slip
it
into
your
pocket
as
an
advance
upon
your
salary
that
is
very
handsome
said
when
should
take
over
my
new
duties
be
in
birmingham
to
morrow
at
one
said
he
have
note
in
my
pocket
here
which
you
will
take
to
my
brother
you
will
find
him
at
126b
corporation
street
where
the
temporary
offices
of
the
company
are
situated
of
course
he
must
confirm
your
engagement
but
between
ourselves
it
will
be
all
right
really
hardly
know
how
to
express
my
gratitude
mr
pinner
said
not
at
all
my
boy
you
have
only
got
your
desserts
there
are
one
or
two
small
things
mere
formalities
which
must
arrange
with
you
have
bit
of
paper
beside
you
there
kindly
write
upon
it
am
perfectly
willing
to
act
as
business
manager
to
the
franco
midland
hardware
company
limited
at
minimum
salary
of
£500
did
as
he
asked
and
he
put
the
paper
in
his
pocket
there
is
one
other
detail
said
he
what
do
you
intend
to
do
about
mawson
had
forgotten
all
about
mawson
in
my
joy
ll
write
and
resign
said
precisely
what
don
want
you
to
do
had
row
over
you
with
mawson
manager
had
gone
up
to
ask
him
about
you
and
he
was
very
offensive
accused
me
of
coaxing
you
away
from
the
service
of
the
firm
and
that
sort
of
thing
at
last
fairly
lost
my
temper
if
you
want
good
men
you
should
pay
them
good
price
said
he
would
rather
have
our
small
price
than
your
big
one
said
he
ll
lay
you
fiver
said
that
when
he
has
my
offer
you
ll
never
so
much
as
hear
from
him
again
done
said
he
we
picked
him
out
of
the
gutter
and
he
won
leave
us
so
easily
those
were
his
very
words
the
impudent
scoundrel
cried
ve
never
so
much
as
seen
him
in
my
life
why
should
consider
him
in
any
way
shall
certainly
not
write
if
you
would
rather
didn
good
that
promise
said
he
rising
from
his
chair
well
delighted
to
have
got
so
good
man
for
my
brother
here
your
advance
of
hundred
pounds
and
here
is
the
letter
make
not
of
the
address
126b
corporation
street
and
remember
that
one
clock
to
morrow
is
your
appointment
good
night
and
may
you
have
all
the
fortune
that
you
deserve
that
just
about
all
that
passed
between
us
as
near
as
can
remember
you
can
imagine
dr
watson
how
pleased
was
at
such
an
extraordinary
bit
of
good
fortune
sat
up
half
the
night
hugging
myself
over
it
and
next
day
was
off
to
birmingham
in
train
that
would
take
me
in
plenty
time
for
my
appointment
took
my
things
to
hotel
in
new
street
and
then
made
my
way
to
the
address
which
had
been
given
me
it
was
quarter
of
an
hour
before
my
time
but
thought
that
would
make
no
difference
126b
was
passage
between
two
large
shops
which
led
to
winding
stone
stair
from
which
there
were
many
flats
let
as
offices
to
companies
or
professional
men
the
names
of
the
occupants
were
painted
at
the
bottom
on
the
wall
but
there
was
no
such
name
as
the
franco
midland
hardware
company
limited
stood
for
few
minutes
with
my
heart
in
my
boots
wondering
whether
the
whole
thing
was
an
elaborate
hoax
or
not
when
up
came
man
and
addressed
me
he
was
very
like
the
chap
had
seen
the
night
before
the
same
figure
and
voice
but
he
was
clean
shaven
and
his
hair
was
lighter
are
you
mr
hall
pycroft
he
asked
yes
said
oh
was
expecting
you
but
you
are
trifle
before
your
time
had
note
from
my
brother
this
morning
in
which
he
sang
your
praises
very
loudly
was
just
looking
for
the
offices
when
you
came
we
have
not
got
our
name
up
yet
for
we
only
secured
these
temporary
premises
last
week
come
up
with
me
and
we
will
talk
the
matter
over
followed
him
to
the
top
of
very
lofty
stair
and
there
right
under
the
slates
were
couple
of
empty
dusty
little
rooms
uncarpeted
and
uncurtained
into
which
he
led
me
had
thought
of
great
office
with
shining
tables
and
rows
of
clerks
such
as
was
used
to
and
dare
say
stared
rather
straight
at
the
two
deal
chairs
and
one
little
table
which
with
ledger
and
waste
paper
basket
made
up
the
whole
furniture
don
be
disheartened
mr
pycroft
said
my
new
acquaintance
seeing
the
length
of
my
face
rome
was
not
built
in
day
and
we
have
lots
of
money
at
our
backs
though
we
don
cut
much
dash
yet
in
offices
pray
sit
down
and
let
me
have
your
letter
gave
it
to
him
and
her
read
it
over
very
carefully
you
seem
to
have
made
vast
impression
upon
my
brother
arthur
said
he
and
know
that
he
is
pretty
shrewd
judge
hew
swears
by
london
you
know
and
by
birmingham
but
this
time
shall
follow
his
advice
pray
consider
yourself
definitely
engaged
what
are
my
duties
asked
you
will
eventually
manage
the
great
depot
in
paris
which
will
pour
flood
of
english
crockery
into
the
shops
of
hundred
and
thirty
four
agents
in
france
the
purchase
will
be
completed
in
week
and
meanwhile
you
will
remain
in
birmingham
and
make
yourself
useful
how
for
answer
he
took
big
red
book
out
of
drawer
this
is
directory
of
paris
said
he
with
the
trades
after
the
names
of
the
people
want
you
to
take
it
home
with
you
and
to
mark
off
al
the
hardware
sellers
with
their
addresses
it
would
be
of
the
greatest
use
to
me
to
have
them
surely
there
are
classified
lists
suggested
not
reliable
ones
their
system
is
different
from
ours
stick
at
it
and
let
me
have
the
lists
by
monday
at
twelve
good
day
mr
pycroft
if
you
continue
to
show
zeal
and
intelligence
you
will
find
the
company
good
master
went
back
to
the
hotel
with
the
big
book
under
my
arm
and
with
very
conflicting
feelings
in
my
breast
on
the
one
hand
was
definitely
engaged
and
had
hundred
pounds
in
my
pocket
on
the
other
the
look
of
the
offices
the
absence
of
name
on
the
wall
and
other
of
the
points
which
would
strike
business
man
had
left
bad
impression
as
to
the
position
of
my
employers
however
come
what
might
had
my
money
so
settled
down
to
my
task
all
sunday
was
kept
hard
at
work
and
yet
by
monday
had
only
got
as
far
as
went
round
to
my
employer
found
him
in
the
same
dismantled
kind
of
room
and
was
told
to
keep
at
it
until
wednesday
and
then
come
again
on
wednesday
it
was
still
unfinished
so
hammered
away
until
friday
that
is
yesterday
then
brought
it
round
to
mr
harry
pinner
thank
you
very
much
said
he
fear
that
underrated
the
difficulty
of
the
task
this
list
will
be
of
very
material
assistance
to
me
it
took
some
time
said
and
now
said
he
want
you
to
make
list
of
the
furniture
shops
for
they
all
sell
crockery
very
good
and
you
can
come
up
to
morrow
evening
at
seven
and
let
me
know
how
you
are
getting
on
don
overwork
yourself
couple
of
hours
at
day
music
hall
in
the
evening
would
do
you
no
harm
after
your
labors
he
laughed
as
he
spoke
and
saw
with
thrill
that
his
second
tooth
upon
the
left
hand
side
had
been
very
badly
stuffed
with
gold

sherlock
holmes
rubbed
his
hands
with
delight
and
stared
with
astonishment
at
our
client
you
may
well
look
surprised
dr
watson
but
it
is
this
way
said
he
when
was
speaking
to
the
other
chap
in
london
at
the
time
that
he
laughed
at
my
not
going
to
mawson
happened
to
notice
that
his
tooth
was
stuffed
in
this
very
identical
fashion
the
glint
of
the
gold
in
each
case
caught
my
eye
you
see
when
put
that
with
the
voice
and
figure
being
the
same
and
only
those
things
altered
which
might
be
changed
by
razor
or
wig
could
not
doubt
that
it
was
the
same
man
of
course
you
expect
two
brothers
to
be
alike
but
not
that
they
should
have
the
same
tooth
stuffed
in
the
same
way
he
bowed
me
out
and
found
myself
in
the
street
hardly
knowing
whether
was
on
my
head
or
my
heels
back
went
to
my
hotel
put
my
head
in
basin
of
cold
water
and
tried
to
think
it
out
why
had
he
sent
me
from
london
to
birmingham
why
had
he
got
there
before
me
and
why
had
he
written
letter
from
himself
to
himself
it
was
altogether
too
much
for
me
and
could
make
no
sense
of
it
and
then
suddenly
it
struck
me
that
what
was
dark
to
me
might
be
very
light
to
mr
sherlock
holmes
had
just
time
to
get
up
to
town
by
the
night
train
to
see
him
this
morning
and
to
bring
you
both
back
with
me
to
birmingham
there
was
pause
after
the
stock
broker
clerk
had
concluded
his
surprising
experience
then
sherlock
holmes
cocked
his
eye
at
me
leaning
back
on
the
cushions
with
pleased
and
yet
critical
face
like
connoisseur
who
has
just
taken
his
first
sip
of
comet
vintage
rather
fine
watson
is
it
not
said
he
there
are
points
in
it
which
please
me
think
that
you
will
agree
with
me
that
an
interview
with
mr
arthur
harry
pinner
in
the
temporary
offices
of
the
franco
midland
hardware
company
limited
would
be
rather
interesting
experience
for
both
of
us
but
how
can
we
do
it
asked
oh
easily
enough
said
hall
pycroft
cheerily
you
are
two
friends
of
mine
who
are
in
want
of
billet
and
what
could
be
more
natural
than
that
should
bring
you
both
round
to
the
managing
director
quite
so
of
course
said
holmes
should
like
to
have
look
at
the
gentleman
and
see
if
can
make
anything
of
his
little
game
what
qualities
have
you
my
friend
which
would
make
your
services
so
valuable
or
is
it
possible
that—
he
began
biting
his
nails
and
staring
blankly
out
of
the
window
and
we
hardly
drew
another
word
from
him
until
we
were
in
new
street
at
seven
clock
that
evening
we
were
walking
the
three
of
us
down
corporation
street
to
the
company
offices
it
is
no
use
our
being
at
all
before
our
time
said
our
client
he
only
comes
there
to
see
me
apparently
for
the
place
is
deserted
up
to
the
very
hour
he
names
that
is
suggestive
remarked
holmes
by
jove
told
you
so
cried
the
clerk
that
he
walking
ahead
of
us
there
he
pointed
to
smallish
dark
well
dressed
man
who
was
bustling
along
the
other
side
of
the
road
as
we
watched
him
he
looked
across
at
boy
who
was
bawling
out
the
latest
edition
of
the
evening
paper
and
running
over
among
the
cabs
and
busses
he
bought
one
from
him
then
clutching
it
in
his
hand
he
vanished
through
door
way
there
he
goes
cried
hall
pycroft
these
are
the
company
offices
into
which
he
has
gone
come
with
me
and
ll
fix
it
up
as
easily
as
possible
following
his
lead
we
ascended
five
stories
until
we
found
ourselves
outside
half
opened
door
at
which
our
client
tapped
voice
within
bade
us
enter
and
we
entered
bare
unfurnished
room
such
as
hall
pycroft
had
described
at
the
single
table
sat
the
man
whom
we
had
seen
in
the
street
with
his
evening
paper
spread
out
in
front
of
him
and
as
he
looked
up
at
us
it
seemed
to
me
that
had
never
looked
upon
face
which
bore
such
marks
of
grief
and
of
something
beyond
grief
of
horror
such
as
comes
to
few
men
in
lifetime
his
brow
glistened
wit
perspiration
his
cheeks
were
of
the
dull
dead
white
of
fish
belly
and
his
eyes
were
wild
and
staring
he
looked
at
his
clerk
as
though
he
failed
to
recognize
him
and
could
see
by
the
astonishment
depicted
upon
our
conductor
face
that
this
was
by
no
means
the
usual
appearance
of
his
employer
you
look
ill
mr
pinner
he
exclaimed
yes
am
not
very
well
answered
the
other
making
obvious
efforts
to
pull
himself
together
and
licking
his
dry
lips
before
he
spoke
who
are
these
gentlemen
whom
you
have
brought
with
you
one
is
mr
harris
of
bermondsey
and
the
other
is
mr
price
of
this
town
said
our
clerk
glibly
they
are
friends
of
mine
and
gentlemen
of
experience
but
they
have
been
out
of
place
for
some
little
time
and
they
hoped
that
perhaps
you
might
find
an
opening
for
them
in
the
company
employment
very
possibly
very
possibly
cried
mr
pinner
with
ghastly
smile
yes
have
no
doubt
that
we
shall
be
able
to
do
something
for
you
what
is
your
particular
line
mr
harris
am
an
accountant
said
holmes
ah
yes
we
shall
want
something
of
the
sort
and
you
mr
price
clerk
said
have
every
hope
that
the
company
may
accommodate
you
will
let
you
know
about
it
as
soon
as
we
come
to
any
conclusion
and
now
beg
that
you
will
go
for
god
sake
leave
me
to
myself
these
last
words
were
shot
out
of
him
as
though
the
constraint
which
he
was
evidently
setting
upon
himself
had
suddenly
and
utterly
burst
asunder
holmes
and
glanced
at
each
other
and
hall
pycroft
took
step
towards
the
table
you
forget
mr
pinner
that
am
here
by
appointment
to
receive
some
directions
from
you
said
he
certainly
mr
pycroft
certainly
the
other
resumed
in
calmer
tone
you
may
wait
here
moment
and
there
is
no
reason
why
your
friends
should
not
wait
with
you
will
be
entirely
at
your
service
in
three
minutes
if
might
trespass
upon
your
patience
so
far
he
rose
with
very
courteous
air
and
bowing
to
us
he
passed
out
through
door
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
which
he
closed
behind
him
what
now
whispered
holmes
is
he
giving
us
the
slip
impossible
answered
pycroft
why
so
that
door
leads
into
an
inner
room
there
is
no
exit
none
is
it
furnished
it
was
empty
yesterday
then
what
on
earth
can
he
be
doing
there
is
something
which
don
understand
in
his
manner
if
ever
man
was
three
parts
mad
with
terror
that
man
name
is
pinner
what
can
have
put
the
shivers
on
him
he
suspects
that
we
are
detectives
suggested
that
it
cried
pycroft
holmes
shook
his
head
he
did
not
turn
pale
he
was
pale
when
we
entered
the
room
said
he
it
is
just
possible
that—
his
words
were
interrupted
by
sharp
rat
tat
from
the
direction
of
the
inner
door
what
the
deuce
is
he
knocking
at
his
own
door
for
cried
the
clerk
again
and
much
louder
cam
the
rat
tat
we
all
gazed
expectantly
at
the
closed
door
glancing
at
holmes
saw
his
face
turn
rigid
and
he
leaned
forward
in
intense
excitement
then
suddenly
came
low
guggling
gargling
sound
and
brisk
drumming
upon
woodwork
holmes
sprang
frantically
across
the
room
and
pushed
at
the
door
it
was
fastened
on
the
inner
side
following
his
example
we
threw
ourselves
upon
it
with
all
our
weight
one
hinge
snapped
then
the
other
and
down
came
the
door
with
crash
rushing
over
it
we
found
ourselves
in
the
inner
room
it
was
empty
but
it
was
only
for
moment
that
we
were
at
fault
at
one
corner
the
corner
nearest
the
room
which
we
had
left
there
was
second
door
holmes
sprang
to
it
and
pulled
it
open
coat
and
waistcoat
were
lying
on
the
floor
and
from
hook
behind
the
door
with
his
own
braces
round
his
neck
was
hanging
the
managing
director
of
the
franco
midland
hardware
company
his
knees
were
drawn
up
his
head
hung
at
dreadful
angle
to
his
body
and
the
clatter
of
his
heels
against
the
door
made
the
noise
which
had
broken
in
upon
our
conversation
in
an
instant
had
caught
him
round
the
waist
and
held
him
up
while
holmes
and
pycroft
untied
the
elastic
bands
which
had
disappeared
between
the
livid
creases
of
skin
then
we
carried
him
into
the
other
room
where
he
lay
with
clay
coloured
face
puffing
his
purple
lips
in
and
out
with
every
breath
dreadful
wreck
of
all
that
he
had
been
but
five
minutes
before
what
do
you
think
of
him
watson
asked
holmes
stooped
over
him
and
examined
him
his
pule
was
feeble
and
intermittent
but
his
breathing
grew
longer
and
there
was
little
shivering
of
his
eyelids
which
showed
thin
white
slit
of
ball
beneath
it
has
been
touch
and
go
with
him
said
but
he
ll
live
now
just
open
that
window
and
hand
me
the
water
carafe
undid
his
collar
poured
the
cold
water
over
his
face
and
raised
and
sank
his
arms
until
he
drew
long
natural
breath
it
only
question
of
time
now
said
as
turned
away
from
him

holmes
stood
by
the
table
with
his
hands
deep
in
his
trouser
pockets
and
his
chin
upon
his
breast
suppose
we
ought
to
call
the
police
in
now
said
he
and
yet
confess
that
like
to
give
them
complete
case
when
they
come
it
blessed
mystery
to
me
cried
pycroft
scratching
his
head
whatever
they
wanted
to
bring
me
all
the
way
up
here
for
and
then—
pooh
all
that
is
clear
enough
said
holmes
impatiently
it
is
this
last
sudden
move
you
understand
the
rest
then
think
that
it
is
fairly
obvious
what
do
you
say
watson
shrugged
my
shoulders
must
confess
that
am
out
of
my
depths
said
oh
surely
if
you
consider
the
events
at
first
they
can
only
point
to
one
conclusion
what
do
you
make
of
them
well
the
whole
thing
hinges
upon
two
points
the
first
is
the
making
of
pycroft
write
declaration
by
which
he
entered
the
service
of
this
preposterous
company
do
you
not
see
how
very
suggestive
that
is
am
afraid
miss
the
point
well
why
did
they
want
him
to
do
it
not
as
business
matter
for
these
arrangements
are
usually
verbal
and
there
was
no
earthly
business
reason
why
this
should
be
an
exception
don
you
see
my
young
friend
that
they
were
very
anxious
to
obtain
specimen
of
your
handwriting
and
had
no
other
way
of
doing
it
and
why
quite
so
why
when
we
answer
that
we
have
made
some
progress
with
our
little
problem
why
there
can
be
only
one
adequate
reason
some
one
wanted
to
learn
to
imitate
your
writing
and
had
to
procure
specimen
of
it
first
and
now
if
we
pass
on
to
the
second
point
we
find
that
each
throws
light
upon
the
other
that
point
is
the
request
made
by
pinner
that
you
should
not
resign
your
place
but
should
leave
the
manager
of
this
important
business
in
the
full
expectation
that
mr
hall
pycroft
whom
he
had
never
seen
was
about
to
enter
the
office
upon
the
monday
morning
my
god
cried
our
client
what
blind
beetle
have
been
now
you
see
the
point
about
the
handwriting
suppose
that
some
one
turned
up
in
your
place
who
wrote
completely
different
hand
from
that
in
which
you
had
applied
for
the
vacancy
of
course
the
game
would
have
been
up
but
in
the
interval
the
rogue
had
learned
to
imitate
you
and
his
position
was
therefore
secure
as
presume
that
nobody
in
the
office
had
ever
set
eyes
upon
you
not
soul
groaned
hall
pycroft
very
good
of
course
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
to
prevent
you
from
thinking
better
of
it
and
also
to
keep
you
from
coming
into
contact
with
any
one
who
might
tell
you
that
your
double
was
at
work
in
mawson
office
therefore
they
gave
you
handsome
advance
on
your
salary
and
ran
you
off
to
the
midlands
where
they
gave
you
enough
work
to
do
to
prevent
your
going
to
london
where
you
might
have
burst
their
little
game
up
that
is
all
plain
enough
but
why
should
this
man
pretend
to
be
his
won
brother
well
that
is
pretty
clear
also
there
are
evidently
only
two
of
them
in
it
the
other
is
personating
you
at
the
office
this
one
acted
as
your
engager
and
then
found
that
he
could
not
find
you
an
employer
without
admitting
third
person
into
his
plot
that
he
was
most
unwilling
to
do
he
changed
his
appearance
as
far
as
he
could
and
trusted
that
the
likeness
which
you
could
not
fail
to
observe
would
be
put
down
to
family
resemblance
but
for
the
happy
chance
of
the
gold
stuffing
your
suspicions
would
probably
never
have
been
aroused
hall
pycroft
shook
his
clinched
hands
in
the
air
good
lord
he
cried
while
have
been
fooled
in
this
way
what
has
this
other
hall
pycroft
been
doing
at
mawson
what
should
we
do
mr
holmes
tell
me
what
to
do
we
must
wire
to
mawson
they
shut
at
twelve
on
saturdays
never
mind
there
may
be
some
door
keeper
or
attendant—
ah
yes
they
keep
permanent
guard
there
on
account
of
the
value
of
the
securities
that
they
hold
remember
hearing
it
talked
of
in
the
city
very
good
we
shall
wire
to
him
and
see
if
all
is
well
and
if
clerk
of
your
name
is
working
there
that
is
clear
enough
but
what
is
not
so
clear
is
why
at
sight
of
us
one
of
the
rogues
should
instantly
walk
out
of
the
room
and
hang
himself
the
paper
croaked
voice
behind
us
the
man
was
sitting
up
blanched
and
ghastly
with
returning
reason
in
his
eyes
and
hands
which
rubbed
nervously
at
the
broad
red
band
which
still
encircled
his
throat
the
paper
of
course
yelled
holmes
in
paroxysm
of
excitement
idiot
that
was
thought
so
must
of
our
visit
that
the
paper
never
entered
my
head
for
an
instant
to
be
sure
the
secret
must
be
there
he
flattened
it
out
upon
the
table
and
cry
of
triumph
burst
from
his
lips
look
at
this
watson
he
cried
it
is
london
paper
an
early
edition
of
the
evening
standard
here
is
what
we
want
look
at
the
headlines
crime
in
the
city
murder
at
mawson
williams
gigantic
attempted
robbery
capture
of
the
criminal
here
watson
we
are
all
equally
anxious
to
hear
it
so
kindly
read
it
aloud
to
us
it
appeared
from
its
position
in
the
paper
to
have
been
the
one
event
of
importance
in
town
and
the
account
of
it
ran
in
this
way
desperate
attempt
at
robbery
culminating
in
the
death
of
one
man
and
the
capture
of
the
criminal
occurred
this
afternoon
in
the
city
for
some
time
back
mawson
williams
the
famous
financial
house
have
been
the
guardians
of
securities
which
amount
in
the
aggregate
to
sum
of
considerably
over
million
sterling
so
conscious
was
the
manager
of
the
responsibility
which
devolved
upon
him
in
consequence
of
the
great
interests
at
stake
that
safes
of
the
very
latest
construction
have
been
employed
and
an
armed
watchman
has
been
left
day
and
night
in
the
building
it
appears
that
last
week
new
clerk
named
hall
pycroft
was
engaged
by
the
firm
this
person
appears
to
have
been
none
other
that
beddington
the
famous
forger
and
cracksman
who
with
his
brother
had
only
recently
emerged
from
five
years
spell
of
penal
servitude
by
some
mean
which
are
not
yet
clear
he
succeeded
in
wining
under
false
name
this
official
position
in
the
office
which
he
utilized
in
order
to
obtain
moulding
of
various
locks
and
thorough
knowledge
of
the
position
of
the
strong
room
and
the
safes
it
is
customary
at
mawson
for
the
clerks
to
leave
at
midday
on
saturday
sergeant
tuson
of
the
city
police
was
somewhat
surprised
therefore
to
see
gentleman
with
carpet
bag
come
down
the
steps
at
twenty
minutes
past
one
his
suspicions
being
aroused
the
sergeant
followed
the
man
and
with
the
aid
of
constable
pollack
succeeded
after
most
desperate
resistance
in
arresting
him
it
was
at
once
clear
that
daring
and
gigantic
robbery
had
been
committed
nearly
hundred
thousand
pounds
worth
of
american
railway
bonds
with
large
amount
of
scrip
in
mines
and
other
companies
was
discovered
in
the
bag
on
examining
the
premises
the
body
of
the
unfortunate
watchman
was
found
doubled
up
and
thrust
into
the
largest
of
the
safes
where
it
would
not
have
been
discovered
until
monday
morning
had
it
not
been
for
the
prompt
action
of
sergeant
tuson
the
man
skull
had
been
shattered
by
blow
from
poker
delivered
from
behind
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
beddington
had
obtained
entrance
by
pretending
that
he
had
left
something
behind
him
and
having
murdered
the
watchman
rapidly
rifled
the
large
safe
and
then
made
off
with
his
booty
his
brother
who
usually
works
with
him
has
not
appeared
in
this
job
as
far
as
can
at
present
be
ascertained
although
the
police
are
making
energetic
inquiries
as
to
his
whereabouts
well
we
may
save
the
police
some
little
trouble
in
that
direction
said
holmes
glancing
at
the
haggard
figure
huddled
up
by
the
window
human
nature
is
strange
mixture
watson
you
see
that
even
villain
and
murderer
can
inspire
such
affection
that
his
brother
turns
to
suicide
when
he
learns
that
his
neck
is
forfeited
however
we
have
no
choice
as
to
our
action
the
doctor
and
will
remain
on
guard
mr
pycroft
if
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
step
out
for
the
police
iv
the
gloria
scott
have
some
papers
here
said
my
friend
sherlock
holmes
as
we
sat
one
winter
night
on
either
side
of
the
fire
which
really
think
watson
that
it
would
be
worth
your
while
to
glance
over
these
are
the
documents
in
the
extraordinary
case
of
the
gloria
scott
and
this
is
the
message
which
struck
justice
of
the
peace
trevor
dead
with
horror
when
he
read
it
he
had
picked
from
drawer
little
tarnished
cylinder
and
undoing
the
tape
he
handed
me
short
note
scrawled
upon
half
sheet
of
slate
grey
paper
the
supply
of
game
for
london
is
going
steadily
up
it
ran

keeper

we
believe
had
been
now

as
glanced
up
from
reading
this
enigmatical
message
saw
holmes
chuckling
at
the
expression
upon
my
face
you
look
little
bewildered
said
he
cannot
see
how
such
message
as
this
could
inspire
horror
it
seems
to
me
to
be
rather
grotesque
than
otherwise
very
likely
yet
the
fact
remains
that
the
reader
who
was
fine
robust
old
man
was
knocked
clean
down
by
it
as
if
it
had
been
the
butt
end
of
pistol
you
arouse
my
curiosity
said
but
why
did
you
say
just
now
that
there
were
very
particular
reasons
why
should
study
this
case
because
it
was
the
first
in
which
was
ever
engaged
had
often
endeavored
to
elicit
from
my
companion
what
had
first
turned
his
mind
in
the
direction
of
criminal
research
but
had
never
caught
him
before
in
communicative
humor
now
he
sat
forward
in
his
arm
chair
and
spread
out
the
documents
upon
his
knees
then
he
lit
his
pipe
and
sat
for
some
time
smoking
and
turning
them
over
you
never
heard
me
talk
of
victor
trevor
he
asked
he
was
the
only
friend
made
during
the
two
years
was
at
college
was
never
very
sociable
fellow
watson
always
rather
fond
of
moping
in
my
rooms
and
working
out
my
own
little
methods
of
thought
so
that
never
mixed
much
with
the
men
of
my
year
bar
fencing
and
boxing
had
few
athletic
tastes
and
then
my
line
of
study
was
quite
distinct
from
that
of
the
other
fellows
so
that
we
had
no
points
of
contact
at
all
trevor
was
the
only
man
knew
and
that
only
through
the
accident
of
his
bull
terrier
freezing
on
to
my
ankle
one
morning
as
went
down
to
chapel
it
was
prosaic
way
of
forming
friendship
but
it
was
effective
was
laid
by
the
heels
for
ten
days
but
trevor
used
to
come
in
to
inquire
after
me
at
first
it
was
only
minute
chat
but
soon
his
visits
lengthened
and
before
the
end
of
the
term
we
were
close
friends
he
was
hearty
full
blooded
fellow
full
of
spirits
and
energy
the
very
opposite
to
me
in
most
respects
but
we
had
some
subjects
in
common
and
it
was
bond
of
union
when
found
that
he
was
as
friendless
as
finally
he
invited
me
down
to
his
father
place
at
donnithorpe
in
norfolk
and
accepted
his
hospitality
for
month
of
the
long
vacation
old
trevor
was
evidently
man
of
some
wealth
and
consideration
and
landed
proprietor
donnithorpe
is
little
hamlet
just
to
the
north
of
langmere
in
the
country
of
the
broads
the
house
was
an
old
fashioned
wide
spread
oak
beamed
brick
building
with
fine
lime
lined
avenue
leading
up
to
it
there
was
excellent
wild
duck
shooting
in
the
fens
remarkably
good
fishing
small
but
select
library
taken
over
as
understood
from
former
occupant
and
tolerable
cook
so
that
he
would
be
fastidious
man
who
could
not
put
in
pleasant
month
there
trevor
senior
was
widower
and
my
friend
his
only
son
there
had
been
daughter
heard
but
she
had
died
of
diphtheria
while
on
visit
to
birmingham
the
father
interested
me
extremely
he
was
man
of
little
culture
but
with
considerable
amount
of
rude
strength
both
physically
and
mentally
he
knew
hardly
any
books
but
he
had
traveled
far
had
seen
much
of
the
world
and
had
remembered
all
that
he
had
learned
in
person
he
was
thick
set
burly
man
with
shock
of
grizzled
hair
brown
weather
beaten
face
and
blue
eyes
which
were
keen
to
the
verge
of
fierceness
yet
he
had
reputation
for
kindness
and
charity
on
the
country
side
and
was
noted
for
the
leniency
of
his
sentences
from
the
bench
one
evening
shortly
after
my
arrival
we
were
sitting
over
glass
of
port
after
dinner
when
young
trevor
began
to
talk
about
those
habits
of
observation
and
inference
which
had
already
formed
into
system
although
had
not
yet
appreciated
the
part
which
they
were
to
play
in
my
life
the
old
man
evidently
thought
that
his
son
was
exaggerating
in
his
description
of
one
or
two
trivial
feats
which
had
performed
come
now
mr
holmes
said
he
laughing
good
humoredly
an
excellent
subject
if
you
can
deduce
anything
from
me
fear
there
is
not
very
much
answered
might
suggest
that
you
have
gone
about
in
fear
of
some
personal
attack
with
the
last
twelvemonth
the
laugh
faded
from
his
lips
and
he
stared
at
me
in
great
surprise
well
that
true
enough
said
he
you
know
victor
turning
to
his
son
when
we
broke
up
that
poaching
gang
they
swore
to
knife
us
and
sir
edward
holly
has
actually
been
attacked
ve
always
been
on
my
guard
since
then
though
have
no
idea
how
you
know
it
you
have
very
handsome
stick
answered
by
the
inscription
observed
that
you
had
not
had
it
more
than
year
but
you
have
taken
some
pains
to
bore
the
head
of
it
and
pour
melted
lead
into
the
hole
so
as
to
make
it
formidable
weapon
argued
that
you
would
not
take
such
precautions
unless
you
had
some
danger
to
fear
anything
else
he
asked
smiling
you
have
boxed
good
deal
in
your
youth
right
again
how
did
you
know
it
is
my
nose
knocked
little
out
of
the
straight
no
said
it
is
your
ears
they
have
the
peculiar
flattening
and
thickening
which
marks
the
boxing
man
anything
else
you
have
done
good
deal
of
digging
by
your
callosities
made
all
my
money
at
the
gold
fields
you
have
been
in
new
zealand
right
again
you
have
visited
japan
quite
true
and
you
have
been
most
intimately
associated
with
some
one
whose
initials
were
and
whom
you
afterwards
were
eager
to
entirely
forget
mr
trevor
stood
slowly
up
fixed
his
large
blue
eyes
upon
me
with
strange
wild
stare
and
then
pitched
forward
with
his
face
among
the
nutshells
which
strewed
the
cloth
in
dead
faint
you
can
imagine
watson
how
shocked
both
his
son
and
were
his
attack
did
not
last
long
however
for
when
we
undid
his
collar
and
sprinkled
the
water
from
one
of
the
finger
glasses
over
his
face
he
gave
gasp
or
two
and
sat
up
ah
boys
said
he
forcing
smile
hope
haven
frightened
you
strong
as
look
there
is
weak
place
in
my
heart
and
it
does
not
take
much
to
knock
me
over
don
know
how
you
manage
this
mr
holmes
but
it
seems
to
me
that
all
the
detectives
of
fact
and
of
fancy
would
be
children
in
your
hands
that
you
line
of
life
sir
and
you
may
take
the
word
of
man
who
has
seen
something
of
the
world
and
that
recommendation
with
the
exaggerated
estimate
of
my
ability
with
which
he
prefaced
it
was
if
you
will
believe
me
watson
the
very
first
thing
which
ever
made
me
feel
that
profession
might
be
made
out
of
what
had
up
to
that
time
been
the
merest
hobby
at
the
moment
however
was
too
much
concerned
at
the
sudden
illness
of
my
host
to
think
of
anything
else
hope
that
have
said
nothing
to
pain
you
said
well
you
certainly
touched
upon
rather
tender
point
might
ask
how
you
know
and
how
much
you
know
he
spoke
now
in
half
jesting
fashion
but
look
of
terror
still
lurked
at
the
back
of
his
eyes
it
is
simplicity
itself
said
when
you
bared
your
arm
to
draw
that
fish
into
the
boat
saw
that
had
been
tattooed
in
the
bend
of
the
elbow
the
letters
were
still
legible
but
it
was
perfectly
clear
from
their
blurred
appearance
and
from
the
staining
of
the
skin
round
them
that
efforts
had
been
made
to
obliterate
them
it
was
obvious
then
that
those
initials
had
once
been
very
familiar
to
you
and
that
you
had
afterwards
wished
to
forget
them
what
an
eye
you
have
he
cried
with
sigh
of
relief
it
is
just
as
you
say
but
we
won
talk
of
it
of
all
ghosts
the
ghosts
of
our
old
lovers
are
the
worst
come
into
the
billiard
room
and
have
quiet
cigar
from
that
day
amid
all
his
cordiality
there
was
always
touch
of
suspicion
in
mr
trevor
manner
towards
me
even
his
son
remarked
it
you
ve
given
the
governor
such
turn
said
he
that
he
ll
never
be
sure
again
of
what
you
know
and
what
you
don
know
he
did
not
mean
to
show
it
am
sure
but
it
was
so
strongly
in
his
mind
that
it
peeped
out
at
every
action
at
last
became
so
convinced
that
was
causing
him
uneasiness
that
drew
my
visit
to
close
on
the
very
day
however
before
left
and
incident
occurred
which
proved
in
the
sequel
to
be
of
importance
we
were
sitting
out
upon
the
lawn
on
garden
chairs
the
three
of
us
basking
in
the
sun
and
admiring
the
view
across
the
broads
when
maid
came
out
to
say
that
there
was
man
at
the
door
who
wanted
to
see
mr
trevor
what
is
his
name
asked
my
host
he
would
not
give
any
what
does
he
want
then
he
says
that
you
know
him
and
that
he
only
wants
moment
conversation
show
him
round
here
an
instant
afterwards
there
appeared
little
wizened
fellow
with
cringing
manner
and
shambling
style
of
walking
he
wore
an
open
jacket
with
splotch
of
tar
on
the
sleeve
red
and
black
check
shirt
dungaree
trousers
and
heavy
boots
badly
worn
his
face
was
thin
and
brown
and
crafty
with
perpetual
smile
upon
it
which
showed
an
irregular
line
of
yellow
teeth
and
his
crinkled
hands
were
half
closed
in
way
that
is
distinctive
of
sailors
as
he
came
slouching
across
the
lawn
heard
mr
trevor
make
sort
of
hiccoughing
noise
in
his
throat
and
jumping
out
of
his
chair
he
ran
into
the
house
he
was
back
in
moment
and
smelt
strong
reek
of
brandy
as
he
passed
me

well
my
man
said
he
what
can
do
for
you
the
sailor
stood
looking
at
him
with
puckered
eyes
and
with
the
same
loose
lipped
smile
upon
his
face
you
don
know
me
he
asked
why
dear
me
it
is
surely
hudson
said
mr
trevor
in
tone
of
surprise
hudson
it
is
sir
said
the
seaman
why
it
thirty
year
and
more
since
saw
you
last
here
you
are
in
your
house
and
me
still
picking
my
salt
meat
out
of
the
harness
cask
tut
you
will
find
that
have
not
forgotten
old
times
cried
mr
trevor
and
walking
towards
the
sailor
he
said
something
in
low
voice
go
into
the
kitchen
he
continued
out
loud
and
you
will
get
food
and
drink
have
no
doubt
that
shall
find
you
situation
thank
you
sir
said
the
seaman
touching
his
fore
lock
just
off
two
yearer
in
an
eight
knot
tramp
short
handed
at
that
and
wants
rest
thought
get
it
either
with
mr
beddoes
or
with
you
ah
cried
trevor
you
know
where
mr
beddoes
is
bless
you
sir
know
where
all
my
old
friends
are
said
the
fellow
with
sinister
smile
and
he
slouched
off
after
the
maid
to
the
kitchen
mr
trevor
mumbled
something
to
us
about
having
been
shipmate
with
the
man
when
he
was
going
back
to
the
diggings
and
then
leaving
us
on
the
lawn
he
went
indoors
an
hour
later
when
we
entered
the
house
we
found
him
stretched
dead
drunk
upon
the
dining
room
sofa
the
whole
incident
left
most
ugly
impression
upon
my
mind
and
was
not
sorry
next
day
to
leave
donnithorpe
behind
me
for
felt
that
my
presence
must
be
source
of
embarrassment
to
my
friend
all
this
occurred
during
the
first
month
of
the
long
vacation
went
up
to
my
london
rooms
where
spent
seven
weeks
working
out
few
experiments
in
organic
chemistry
one
day
however
when
the
autumn
was
far
advanced
and
the
vacation
drawing
to
close
received
telegram
from
my
friend
imploring
me
to
return
to
donnithorpe
and
saying
that
he
was
in
great
need
of
my
advice
and
assistance
of
course
dropped
everything
and
set
out
for
the
north
once
more
he
met
me
with
the
dog
cart
at
the
station
and
saw
at
glance
that
the
last
two
months
had
been
very
trying
ones
for
him
he
had
grown
thin
and
careworn
and
had
lost
the
loud
cheery
manner
for
which
he
had
been
remarkable
the
governor
is
dying
were
the
first
words
he
said
impossible
cried
what
is
the
matter
apoplexy
nervous
shock
he
been
on
the
verge
all
day
doubt
if
we
shall
find
him
alive
was
as
you
may
think
watson
horrified
at
this
unexpected
news
what
has
caused
it
asked
ah
that
is
the
point
jump
in
and
we
can
talk
it
over
while
we
drive
you
remember
that
fellow
who
came
upon
the
evening
before
you
left
us
perfectly
do
you
know
who
it
was
that
we
let
into
the
house
that
day
have
no
idea
it
was
the
devil
holmes
he
cried
stared
at
him
in
astonishment
yes
it
was
the
devil
himself
we
have
not
had
peaceful
hour
since
not
one
the
governor
has
never
held
up
his
head
from
that
evening
and
now
the
life
has
been
crushed
out
of
him
and
his
heart
broken
all
through
this
accursed
hudson
what
power
had
he
then
ah
that
is
what
would
give
so
much
to
know
the
kindly
charitable
good
old
governor
how
could
he
have
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
such
ruffian
but
am
so
glad
that
you
have
come
holmes
trust
very
much
to
your
judgment
and
discretion
and
know
that
you
will
advise
me
for
the
best
we
were
dashing
along
the
smooth
white
country
road
with
the
long
stretch
of
the
broads
in
front
of
us
glimmering
in
the
red
light
of
the
setting
sun
from
grove
upon
our
left
could
already
see
the
high
chimneys
and
the
flag
staff
which
marked
the
squire
dwelling
my
father
made
the
fellow
gardener
said
my
companion
and
then
as
that
did
not
satisfy
him
he
was
promoted
to
be
butler
the
house
seemed
to
be
at
his
mercy
and
he
wandered
about
and
did
what
he
chose
in
it
the
maids
complained
of
his
drunken
habits
and
his
vile
language
the
dad
raised
their
wages
all
round
to
recompense
them
for
the
annoyance
the
fellow
would
take
the
boat
and
my
father
best
gun
and
treat
himself
to
little
shooting
trips
and
all
this
with
such
sneering
leering
insolent
face
that
would
have
knocked
him
down
twenty
times
over
if
he
had
been
man
of
my
own
age
tell
you
holmes
have
had
to
keep
tight
hold
upon
myself
all
this
time
and
now
am
asking
myself
whether
if
had
let
myself
go
little
more
might
not
have
been
wiser
man
well
matters
went
from
bad
to
worse
with
us
and
this
animal
hudson
became
more
and
more
intrusive
until
at
last
on
making
some
insolent
reply
to
my
father
in
my
presence
one
day
took
him
by
the
shoulders
and
turned
him
out
of
the
room
he
slunk
away
with
livid
face
and
two
venomous
eyes
which
uttered
more
threats
than
his
tongue
could
do
don
know
what
passed
between
the
poor
dad
and
him
after
that
but
the
dad
came
to
me
next
day
and
asked
me
whether
would
mind
apologizing
to
hudson
refused
as
you
can
imagine
and
asked
my
father
how
he
could
allow
such
wretch
to
take
such
liberties
with
himself
and
his
household
ah
my
boy
said
he
it
is
all
very
well
to
talk
but
you
don
know
how
am
placed
but
you
shall
know
victor
ll
see
that
you
shall
know
come
what
may
you
wouldn
believe
harm
of
your
poor
old
father
would
you
lad
he
was
very
much
moved
and
shut
himself
up
in
the
study
all
day
where
could
see
through
the
window
that
he
was
writing
busily
that
evening
there
came
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
grand
release
for
hudson
told
us
that
he
was
going
to
leave
us
he
walked
into
the
dining
room
as
we
sat
after
dinner
and
announced
his
intention
in
the
thick
voice
of
half
drunken
man
ve
had
enough
of
norfolk
said
he
ll
run
down
to
mr
beddoes
in
hampshire
he
ll
be
as
glad
to
see
me
as
you
were
dare
say
you
re
not
going
away
in
any
kind
of
spirit
hudson
hope
said
my
father
with
tameness
which
made
my
blood
boil
ve
not
had
my
pology
said
he
sulkily
glancing
in
my
direction
victor
you
will
acknowledge
that
you
have
used
this
worthy
fellow
rather
roughly
said
the
dad
turning
to
me
on
the
contrary
think
that
we
have
both
shown
extraordinary
patience
towards
him
answered
oh
you
do
you
he
snarls
very
good
mate
we
ll
see
about
that
he
slouched
out
of
the
room
and
half
an
hour
afterwards
left
the
house
leaving
my
father
in
state
of
pitiable
nervousness
night
after
night
heard
him
pacing
his
room
and
it
was
just
as
he
was
recovering
his
confidence
that
the
blow
did
at
last
fall
and
how
asked
eagerly
in
most
extraordinary
fashion
letter
arrived
for
my
father
yesterday
evening
bearing
the
fordingbridge
post
mark
my
father
read
it
clapped
both
his
hands
to
his
head
and
began
running
round
the
room
in
little
circles
like
man
who
has
been
driven
out
of
his
senses
when
at
last
drew
him
down
on
to
the
sofa
his
mouth
and
eyelids
were
all
puckered
on
one
side
and
saw
that
he
had
stroke
dr
fordham
came
over
at
once
we
put
him
to
bed
but
the
paralysis
has
spread
he
has
shown
no
sign
of
returning
consciousness
and
think
that
we
shall
hardly
find
him
alive
you
horrify
me
trevor
cried
what
then
could
have
been
in
this
letter
to
cause
so
dreadful
result
nothing
there
lies
the
inexplicable
part
of
it
the
message
was
absurd
and
trivial
ah
my
god
it
is
as
feared
as
he
spoke
we
came
round
the
curve
of
the
avenue
and
saw
in
the
fading
light
that
every
blind
in
the
house
had
been
drawn
down
as
we
dashed
up
to
the
door
my
friend
face
convulsed
with
grief
gentleman
in
black
emerged
from
it
when
did
it
happen
doctor
asked
trevor
almost
immediately
after
you
left
did
he
recover
consciousness
for
an
instant
before
the
end
any
message
for
me
only
that
the
papers
were
in
the
back
drawer
of
the
japanese
cabinet
my
friend
ascended
with
the
doctor
to
the
chamber
of
death
while
remained
in
the
study
turning
the
whole
matter
over
and
over
in
my
head
and
feeling
as
sombre
as
ever
had
done
in
my
life
what
was
the
past
of
this
trevor
pugilist
traveler
and
gold
digger
and
how
had
he
placed
himself
in
the
power
of
this
acid
faced
seaman
why
too
should
he
faint
at
an
allusion
to
the
half
effaced
initials
upon
his
arm
and
die
of
fright
when
he
had
letter
from
fordingham
then
remembered
that
fordingham
was
in
hampshire
and
that
this
mr
beddoes
whom
the
seaman
had
gone
to
visit
and
presumably
to
blackmail
had
also
been
mentioned
as
living
in
hampshire
the
letter
then
might
either
come
from
hudson
the
seaman
saying
that
he
had
betrayed
the
guilty
secret
which
appeared
to
exist
or
it
might
come
from
beddoes
warning
an
old
confederate
that
such
betrayal
was
imminent
so
far
it
seemed
clear
enough
but
then
how
could
this
letter
be
trivial
and
grotesque
as
describe
by
the
son
he
must
have
misread
it
if
so
it
must
have
been
one
of
those
ingenious
secret
codes
which
mean
one
thing
while
they
seem
to
mean
another
must
see
this
letter
if
there
were
hidden
meaning
in
it
was
confident
that
could
pluck
it
forth
for
an
hour
sat
pondering
over
it
in
the
gloom
until
at
last
weeping
maid
brought
in
lamp
and
close
at
her
heels
came
my
friend
trevor
pale
but
composed
with
these
very
papers
which
lie
upon
my
knee
held
in
his
grasp
he
sat
down
opposite
to
me
drew
the
lamp
to
the
edge
of
the
table
and
handed
me
short
note
scribbled
as
you
see
upon
single
sheet
of
grey
paper
the
supply
of
game
for
london
is
going
steadily
up
it
ran
head
keeper
hudson
we
believe
has
been
now
told
to
receive
all
orders
for
fly
paper
and
for
preservation
of
you

dare
say
my
face
looked
as
bewildered
as
yours
did
just
now
when
first
read
this
message
then
reread
it
very
carefully
it
was
evidently
as
had
thought
and
some
secret
meaning
must
lie
buried
in
this
strange
combination
of
words
or
could
it
be
that
there
was
prearranged
significance
to
such
phrases
as
fly
paper
and
hen
pheasant
such
meaning
would
be
arbitrary
and
could
not
be
deduced
in
any
way
and
yet
was
loath
to
believe
that
this
was
the
case
and
the
presence
of
the
word
hudson
seemed
to
show
that
the
subject
of
the
message
was
as
had
guessed
and
that
it
was
from
beddoes
rather
than
the
sailor
tried
it
backwards
but
the
combination
life
pheasant
hen
was
not
encouraging
then
tried
alternate
words
but
neither
the
of
for
nor
supply
game
london
promised
to
throw
any
light
upon
it
and
then
in
an
instant
the
key
of
the
riddle
was
in
my
hands
and
saw
that
every
third
word
beginning
with
the
first
would
give
message
which
might
well
drive
old
trevor
to
despair
it
was
short
and
terse
the
warning
as
now
read
it
to
my
companion
the
game
is
up
hudson
has
told
all
fly
for
your
life
victor
trevor
sank
his
face
into
his
shaking
hands
it
must
be
that
suppose
said
he
this
is
worse
than
death
for
it
means
disgrace
as
well
but
what
is
the
meaning
of
these
head
keepers
and
hen
pheasants
it
means
nothing
to
the
message
but
it
might
mean
good
deal
to
us
if
we
had
no
other
means
of
discovering
the
sender
you
see
that
he
has
begun
by
writing
the…game…is
and
so
on
afterwards
he
had
to
fulfill
the
prearranged
cipher
to
fill
in
any
two
words
in
each
space
he
would
naturally
use
the
first
words
which
came
to
his
mind
and
if
there
were
so
many
which
referred
to
sport
among
them
you
may
be
tolerably
sure
that
he
is
either
an
ardent
shot
or
interested
in
breeding
do
you
know
anything
of
this
beddoes
why
now
that
you
mention
it
said
he
remember
that
my
poor
father
used
to
have
an
invitation
from
him
to
shoot
over
his
preserves
every
autumn
then
it
is
undoubtedly
from
him
that
the
note
comes
said
it
only
remains
for
us
to
find
out
what
this
secret
was
which
the
sailor
hudson
seems
to
have
held
over
the
heads
of
these
two
wealthy
and
respected
men
alas
holmes
fear
that
it
is
one
of
sin
and
shame
cried
my
friend
but
from
you
shall
have
no
secrets
here
is
the
statement
which
was
drawn
up
by
my
father
when
he
knew
that
the
danger
from
hudson
had
become
imminent
found
it
in
the
japanese
cabinet
as
he
told
the
doctor
take
it
and
read
it
to
me
for
have
neither
the
strength
nor
the
courage
to
do
it
myself
these
are
the
very
papers
watson
which
he
handed
to
me
and
will
read
them
to
you
as
read
them
in
the
old
study
that
night
to
him
they
are
endorsed
outside
as
you
see
some
particulars
of
the
voyage
of
the
bark
gloria
scott
from
her
leaving
falmouth
on
the
8th
october
1855
to
her
destruction
in
lat
15
degrees
20
long
25
degrees
14
on
nov
6th
it
is
in
the
form
of
letter
and
runs
in
this
way
my
dear
son
now
that
approaching
disgrace
begins
to
darken
the
closing
years
of
my
life
can
write
with
all
truth
and
honesty
that
it
is
not
the
terror
of
the
law
it
is
not
the
loss
of
my
position
in
the
county
nor
is
it
my
fall
in
the
eyes
of
all
who
have
known
me
which
cuts
me
to
the
heart
but
it
is
the
thought
that
you
should
come
to
blush
for
me
you
who
love
me
and
who
have
seldom
hope
had
reason
to
do
other
than
respect
me
but
if
the
blow
falls
which
is
forever
hanging
over
me
then
should
wish
you
to
read
this
that
you
may
know
straight
from
me
how
far
have
been
to
blame
on
the
other
hand
if
all
should
go
well
which
may
kind
god
almighty
grant
then
if
by
any
chance
this
paper
should
be
still
undestroyed
and
should
fall
into
your
hands
conjure
you
by
all
you
hold
sacred
by
the
memory
of
your
dear
mother
and
by
the
love
which
had
been
between
us
to
hurl
it
into
the
fire
and
to
never
give
one
thought
to
it
again
if
then
your
eye
goes
onto
read
this
line
know
that
shall
already
have
been
exposed
and
dragged
from
my
home
or
as
is
more
likely
for
you
know
that
my
heart
is
weak
by
lying
with
my
tongue
sealed
forever
in
death
in
either
case
the
time
for
suppression
is
past
and
every
word
which
tell
you
is
the
naked
truth
and
this
swear
as
hope
for
mercy
my
name
dear
lad
is
not
trevor
was
james
armitage
in
my
younger
days
and
you
can
understand
now
the
shock
that
it
was
to
me
few
weeks
ago
when
your
college
friend
addressed
me
in
words
which
seemed
to
imply
that
he
had
surprised
my
secret
as
armitage
it
was
that
entered
london
banking
house
and
as
armitage
was
convicted
of
breaking
my
country
laws
and
was
sentenced
to
transportation
do
not
think
very
harshly
of
me
laddie
it
was
debt
of
honour
so
called
which
had
to
pay
and
used
money
which
was
not
my
own
to
do
it
in
the
certainty
that
could
replace
it
before
there
could
be
any
possibility
of
its
being
missed
but
the
most
dreadful
ill
luck
pursued
me
the
money
which
had
reckoned
upon
never
came
to
hand
and
premature
examination
of
accounts
exposed
my
deficit
the
case
might
have
been
dealt
leniently
with
but
the
laws
were
more
harshly
administered
thirty
years
ago
than
now
and
on
my
twenty
third
birthday
found
myself
chained
as
felon
with
thirty
seven
other
convicts
in
tween
decks
of
the
bark
gloria
scott
bound
for
australia
it
was
the
year
55
when
the
crimean
war
was
at
its
height
and
the
old
convict
ships
had
been
largely
used
as
transports
in
the
black
sea
the
government
was
compelled
therefore
to
use
smaller
and
less
suitable
vessels
for
sending
out
their
prisoners
the
gloria
scott
had
been
in
the
chinese
tea
trade
but
she
was
an
old
fashioned
heavy
bowed
broad
beamed
craft
and
the
new
clippers
had
cut
her
out
she
was
five
hundred
ton
boat
and
besides
her
thirty
eight
jail
birds
she
carried
twenty
six
of
crew
eighteen
soldiers
captain
three
mates
doctor
chaplain
and
four
warders
nearly
hundred
souls
were
in
her
all
told
when
we
set
sail
from
falmouth
the
partitions
between
the
cells
of
the
convicts
instead
of
being
of
thick
oak
as
is
usual
in
convict
ships
were
quite
thin
and
frail
the
man
next
to
me
upon
the
aft
side
was
one
whom
had
particularly
noticed
when
we
were
led
down
the
quay
he
was
young
man
with
clear
hairless
face
long
thin
nose
and
rather
nut
cracker
jaws
he
carried
his
head
very
jauntily
in
the
air
had
swaggering
style
of
walking
and
was
above
all
else
remarkable
for
his
extraordinary
height
don
think
any
of
our
heads
would
have
come
up
to
his
shoulder
and
am
sure
that
he
could
not
have
measured
less
than
six
and
half
feet
it
was
strange
among
so
many
sad
and
weary
faces
to
see
one
which
was
full
of
energy
and
resolution
the
sight
of
it
was
to
me
like
fire
in
snow
storm
was
glad
then
to
find
that
he
was
my
neighbor
and
gladder
still
when
in
the
dead
of
the
night
heard
whisper
close
to
my
ear
and
found
that
he
had
managed
to
cut
an
opening
in
the
board
which
separated
us
hullo
chummy
said
he
what
your
name
and
what
are
you
here
for
answered
him
and
asked
in
turn
who
was
talking
with
jack
prendergast
said
he
and
by
god
you
ll
learn
to
bless
my
name
before
you
ve
done
with
me
remembered
hearing
of
his
case
for
it
was
one
which
had
made
an
immense
sensation
throughout
the
country
some
time
before
my
own
arrest
he
was
man
of
good
family
and
of
great
ability
but
on
incurably
vicious
habits
who
had
be
an
ingenious
system
of
fraud
obtained
huge
sums
of
money
from
the
leading
london
merchants
ha
you
remember
my
case
said
he
proudly
very
well
indeed
then
maybe
you
remember
something
queer
about
it
what
was
that
then
had
nearly
quarter
of
million
hadn
so
it
was
said
but
none
was
recovered
eh
no
well
where
ye
suppose
the
balance
is
he
asked
have
no
idea
said
right
between
my
finger
and
thumb
he
cried
by
god
ve
go
more
pounds
to
my
name
than
you
ve
hairs
on
your
head
and
if
you
ve
money
my
son
and
know
how
to
handle
it
and
spread
it
you
can
do
anything
now
you
don
think
it
likely
that
man
who
could
do
anything
is
going
to
wear
his
breeches
out
sitting
in
the
stinking
hold
of
rat
gutted
beetle
ridden
mouldy
old
coffin
of
chin
china
coaster
no
sir
such
man
will
look
after
himself
and
will
look
after
his
chums
you
may
lay
to
that
you
hold
on
to
him
and
you
may
kiss
the
book
that
he
ll
haul
you
through
that
was
his
style
of
talk
and
at
first
thought
it
meant
nothing
but
after
while
when
he
had
tested
me
and
sworn
me
in
with
all
possible
solemnity
he
let
me
understand
that
there
really
was
plot
to
gain
command
of
the
vessel
dozen
of
the
prisoners
had
hatched
it
before
they
came
aboard
prendergast
was
the
leader
and
his
money
was
the

said
he
rare
good
man
as
true
as
stock
to

he
got
the
dibbs
he
has
and
where
do
you
think
he
is
at
this
moment
why
he
the
chaplain
of
this
ship
the
chaplain
no
less
he
came
aboard
with
black
coat
and
his
papers
right
and
money
enough
in
his
box
to
buy
the
thing
right
up
from
keel
to
main
truck
the
crew
are
his
body
and
soul
he
could
buy
em
at
so
much
gross
with
cash
discount
and
he
did
it
before
ever
they
signed
on
he
got
two
of
the
warders
and
mereer
the
second
mate
and
he
get
the
captain
himself
if
he
thought
him
worth
it
what
are
we
to
do
then
asked
what
do
you
think
said
he
we
ll
make
the
coats
of
some
of
these
soldiers
redder
than
ever
the
tailor
did
but
they
are
armed
said
and
so
shall
we
be
my
boy
there
brace
of
pistols
for
every
mother
son
of
us
and
if
we
can
carry
this
ship
with
the
crew
at
our
back
it
time
we
were
all
sent
to
young
misses
boarding
school
you
speak
to
your
mate
upon
the
left
to
night
and
see
if
he
is
to
be
trusted
did
so
and
found
my
other
neighbor
to
be
young
fellow
in
much
the
same
position
as
myself
whose
crime
had
been
forgery
his
name
was
evans
but
he
afterwards
changed
it
like
myself
and
his
is
now
rich
and
prosperous
man
in
the
south
of
england
he
was
ready
enough
to
join
the
conspiracy
as
the
only
means
of
saving
ourselves
and
before
we
had
crossed
the
bay
there
were
only
two
of
the
prisoners
who
were
not
in
the
secret
one
of
these
was
of
weak
mind
and
we
did
not
dare
to
trust
him
and
the
other
was
suffering
from
jaundice
and
could
not
be
of
any
use
to
us
from
the
beginning
there
was
really
nothing
to
prevent
us
from
taking
possession
of
the
ship
the
crew
were
set
of
ruffians
specially
picked
for
the
job
the
sham
chaplain
came
into
our
cells
to
exhort
us
carrying
black
bag
supposed
to
be
full
of
tracts
and
so
often
did
he
come
that
by
the
third
day
we
had
each
stowed
away
at
the
foot
of
our
beds
file
brace
of
pistols
pound
of
powder
and
twenty
slugs
two
of
the
warders
were
agents
of
prendergast
and
the
second
mate
was
his
right
hand
man
the
captain
the
two
mates
two
warders
lieutenant
martin
his
eighteen
soldiers
and
the
doctor
were
all
that
we
had
against
us
yet
safe
as
it
was
we
determined
to
neglect
no
precaution
and
to
make
our
attack
suddenly
by
night
it
came
however
more
quickly
than
we
expected
and
in
this
way
one
evening
about
the
third
week
after
our
start
the
doctor
had
come
down
to
see
one
of
the
prisoners
who
was
ill
and
putting
his
hand
down
on
the
bottom
of
his
bunk
he
felt
the
outline
of
the
pistols
if
he
had
been
silent
he
might
have
blown
the
whole
thing
but
he
was
nervous
little
chap
so
he
gave
cry
of
surprise
and
turned
so
pale
that
the
man
knew
what
was
up
in
an
instant
and
seized
him
he
was
gagged
before
he
could
give
the
alarm
and
tied
down
upon
the
bed
he
had
unlocked
the
door
that
led
to
the
deck
and
we
were
through
it
in
rush
the
two
sentries
were
shot
down
and
so
was
corporal
who
came
running
to
see
what
was
the
matter
there
were
two
more
soldiers
at
the
door
of
the
state
room
and
their
muskets
seemed
not
to
be
loaded
for
they
never
fired
upon
us
and
they
were
shot
while
trying
to
fix
their
bayonets
then
we
rushed
on
into
the
captain
cabin
but
as
we
pushed
open
the
door
there
was
an
explosion
from
within
and
there
he
lay
wit
his
brains
smeared
over
the
chart
of
the
atlantic
which
was
pinned
upon
the
table
while
the
chaplain
stood
with
smoking
pistol
in
his
hand
at
his
elbow
the
two
mates
had
both
been
seized
by
the
crew
and
the
whole
business
seemed
to
be
settled
the
state
room
was
next
the
cabin
and
we
flocked
in
there
and
flopped
down
on
the
settees
all
speaking
together
for
we
were
just
mad
with
the
feeling
that
we
were
free
once
more
there
were
lockers
all
round
and
wilson
the
sham
chaplain
knocked
one
of
them
in
and
pulled
out
dozen
of
brown
sherry
we
cracked
off
the
necks
of
the
bottles
poured
the
stuff
out
into
tumblers
and
were
just
tossing
them
off
when
in
an
instant
without
warning
there
came
the
roar
of
muskets
in
our
ears
and
the
saloon
was
so
full
of
smoke
that
we
could
not
see
across
the
table
when
it
cleared
again
the
place
was
shambles
wilson
and
eight
others
were
wriggling
on
the
top
of
each
other
on
the
floor
and
the
blood
and
the
brown
sherry
on
that
table
turn
me
sick
now
when
think
of
it
we
were
so
cowed
by
the
sight
that
think
we
should
have
given
the
job
up
if
it
had
not
been
for
prendergast
he
bellowed
like
bull
and
rushed
for
the
door
with
all
that
were
left
alive
at
his
heels
out
we
ran
and
there
on
the
poop
were
the
lieutenent
and
ten
of
his
men
the
swing
skylights
above
the
saloon
table
had
been
bit
open
and
they
had
fired
on
us
through
the
slit
we
got
on
them
before
they
could
load
and
they
stood
to
it
like
men
but
we
had
the
upper
hand
of
them
and
in
five
minutes
it
was
all
over
my
god
was
there
ever
slaughter
house
like
that
ship
predergast
was
like
raging
devil
and
he
picked
the
soldiers
up
as
if
they
had
been
children
and
threw
them
overboard
alive
or
dead
there
was
one
sergeant
that
was
horribly
wounded
and
yet
kept
on
swimming
for
surprising
time
until
some
one
in
mercy
blew
out
his
brains
when
the
fighting
was
over
there
was
no
one
left
of
our
enemies
except
just
the
warders
the
mates
and
the
doctor
it
was
over
them
that
the
great
quarrel
arose
there
were
many
of
us
who
were
glad
enough
to
win
back
our
freedom
and
yet
who
had
no
wish
to
have
murder
on
our
souls
it
was
one
thing
to
knock
the
soldiers
over
with
their
muskets
in
their
hands
and
it
was
another
to
stand
by
while
men
were
being
killed
in
cold
blood
eight
of
us
five
convicts
and
three
sailors
said
that
we
would
not
see
it
done
but
there
was
no
moving
predergast
and
those
who
were
with
him
our
only
chance
of
safety
lay
in
making
clean
job
of
it
said
he
and
he
would
not
leave
tongue
with
power
to
wag
in
witness
box
it
nearly
came
to
our
sharing
the
fate
of
the
prisoners
but
at
last
he
said
that
if
we
wished
we
might
take
boat
and
go
we
jumped
at
the
offer
for
we
were
already
sick
of
these
blookthirsty
doings
and
we
saw
that
there
would
be
worse
before
it
was
done
we
were
given
suit
of
sailor
togs
each
barrel
of
water
two
casks
one
of
junk
and
one
of
biscuits
and
compass
prendergast
threw
us
over
chart
told
us
that
we
were
shipwrecked
mariners
whose
ship
had
foundered
in
lat
15
degrees
and
long
25
degrees
west
and
then
cut
the
painter
and
let
us
go
and
now
come
to
the
most
surprising
part
of
my
story
my
dear
son
the
seamen
had
hauled
the
fore
yard
aback
during
the
rising
but
now
as
we
left
them
they
brought
it
square
again
and
as
there
was
light
wind
from
the
north
and
east
the
bark
began
to
draw
slowly
away
from
us
our
boat
lay
rising
and
falling
upon
the
long
smooth
rollers
and
evans
and
who
were
the
most
educated
of
the
party
were
sitting
in
the
sheets
working
out
our
position
and
planning
what
coast
we
should
make
for
it
was
nice
question
for
the
cape
de
verds
were
about
five
hundred
miles
to
the
north
of
us
and
the
african
coast
about
seven
hundred
to
the
east
on
the
whole
as
the
wind
was
coming
round
to
the
north
we
thought
that
sierra
leone
might
be
best
and
turned
our
head
in
that
direction
the
bark
being
at
that
time
nearly
hull
down
on
our
starboard
quarter
suddenly
as
we
looked
at
her
we
saw
dense
black
cloud
of
smoke
shoot
up
from
her
which
hung
like
monstrous
tree
upon
the
sky
line
few
seconds
later
roar
like
thunder
burst
upon
our
ears
and
as
the
smoke
thinned
away
there
was
no
sign
left
of
the
gloria
scott
in
an
instant
we
swept
the
boat
head
round
again
and
pulled
with
all
our
strength
for
the
place
where
the
haze
still
trailing
over
the
water
marked
the
scene
of
this
catastrophe
it
was
long
hour
before
we
reached
it
and
at
first
we
feared
that
we
had
come
too
late
to
save
any
one
splintered
boat
and
number
of
crates
and
fragments
of
spars
rising
and
falling
on
the
waves
showed
us
where
the
vessel
had
foundered
but
there
was
no
sign
life
and
we
had
turned
away
in
despair
when
we
heard
cry
for
help
and
saw
at
some
distance
piece
of
wreckage
with
man
lying
stretched
across
it
when
we
pulled
him
aboard
the
boat
he
proved
to
be
young
seaman
of
the
name
of
hudson
who
was
so
burned
and
exhausted
that
he
could
give
us
no
account
of
what
had
happened
until
the
following
morning
it
seemed
that
after
we
had
left
prendergast
and
his
gang
had
proceeded
to
put
to
death
the
five
remaining
prisoners
the
two
warders
had
been
shot
and
thrown
overboard
and
so
also
had
the
third
mate
prendergast
then
descended
into
the
tween
decks
and
with
his
own
hands
cut
the
throat
of
the
unfortunate
surgeon
there
only
remained
the
first
mate
who
was
bold
and
active
man
when
he
saw
the
convict
approaching
him
with
the
bloody
knife
in
his
hand
he
kicked
off
his
bonds
which
he
had
somehow
contrived
to
loosen
and
rushing
down
the
deck
he
plunged
into
the
after
hold
dozen
convicts
who
descended
with
their
pistols
in
search
of
him
found
him
with
match
box
in
his
hand
seated
beside
an
open
powder
barrel
which
was
one
of
hundred
carried
on
board
and
swearing
that
he
would
blow
all
hands
up
if
he
were
in
any
way
molested
an
instant
later
the
explosion
occurred
though
hudson

such
in
few
words
my
dear
boy
is
the
history
of
this
terrible
business
in
which
was
involved
next
day
we
were
picked
up
by
the
brig
hotspur
bound
for
australia
whose
captain
found
no
difficulty
in
believing
that
we
were
the
survivors
of
passenger
ship
which
had
foundered
the
transport
ship
gloria
scott
was
set
down
by
the
admiralty
as
being
lost
at
sea
and
no
word
has
ever
leaked
out
as
to
her
true
fate
after
an
excellent
voyage
the
hotspur
landed
us
at
sydney
where
evans
and
changed
our
names
and
made
our
way
to
the
diggings
where
among
the
crowds
who
were
gathered
from
all
nations
we
had
no
difficulty
in
losing
our
former
identities
the
rest
need
not
relate
we
prospered
we
traveled
we
came
back
as
rich
colonials
to
england
and
we
bought
country
estates
for
more
than
twenty
years
we
have
led
peaceful
and
useful
lives
and
we
hoped
that
our
past
was
forever
buried
imagine
then
my
feelings
when
in
the
seaman
who
came
to
us
recognized
instantly
the
man
who
had
been
picked
off
the
wreck
he
had
tracked
us
down
somehow
and
had
set
himself
to
live
upon
our
fears
you
will
understand
now
how
it
was
that
strove
to
keep
the
peace
with
him
and
you
will
in
some
measure
sympathize
with
me
in
the
fears
which
fill
me
now
that
he
has
gone
from
me
to
his
other
victim
with
threats
upon
his
tongue
underneath
is
written
in
hand
so
shaky
as
to
be
hardly
legible
beddoes
writes
in
cipher
to
say
has
told
all
sweet
lord
have
mercy
on
our
souls
that
was
the
narrative
which
read
that
night
to
young
trevor
and
think
watson
that
under
the
circumstances
it
was
dramatic
one
the
good
fellow
was
heart
broken
at
it
and
went
out
to
the
terai
tea
planting
where
hear
that
he
is
doing
well
as
to
the
sailor
and
beddoes
neither
of
them
was
ever
heard
of
again
after
that
day
on
which
the
letter
of
warning
was
written
they
both
disappeared
utterly
and
completely
no
complaint
had
been
lodged
with
the
police
so
that
beddoes
had
mistaken
threat
for
deed
hudson
had
been
seen
lurking
about
and
it
was
believed
by
the
police
that
he
had
done
away
with
beddoes
and
had
fled
for
myself
believe
that
the
truth
was
exactly
the
opposite
think
that
it
is
most
probable
that
beddoes
pushed
to
desperation
and
believing
himself
to
have
been
already
betrayed
had
revenged
himself
upon
hudson
and
had
fled
from
the
country
with
as
much
money
as
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
those
are
the
facts
of
the
case
doctor
and
if
they
are
of
any
use
to
your
collection
am
sure
that
they
are
very
heartily
at
your
service
the
musgrave
ritual
an
anomaly
which
often
struck
me
in
the
character
of
my
friend
sherlock
holmes
was
that
although
in
his
methods
of
thought
he
was
the
neatest
and
most
methodical
of
mankind
and
although
also
he
affected
certain
quiet
primness
of
dress
he
was
none
the
less
in
his
personal
habits
one
of
the
most
untidy
men
that
ever
drove
fellow
lodger
to
distraction
not
that
am
in
the
least
conventional
in
that
respect
myself
the
rough
and
tumble
work
in
afghanistan
coming
on
the
top
of
natural
bohemianism
of
disposition
has
made
me
rather
more
lax
than
befits
medical
man
who
keeps
his
cigars
in
the
coal
scuttle
his
tobacco
in
the
toe
end
of
persian
slipper
and
his
unanswered
correspondence
transfixed
by
jack
knife
into
the
very
centre
of
his
wooden
mantelpiece
then
begin
to
give
myself
virtuous
airs
have
always
held
too
that
pistol
practice
should
be
distinctly
an
open
air
pastime
and
when
holmes
in
one
of
his
queer
humors
would
sit
in
an
arm
chair
with
his
hair
trigger
and
hundred
boxer
cartridges
and
proceed
to
adorn
the
opposite
wall
with
patriotic
done
in
bullet
pocks
felt
strongly
that
neither
the
atmosphere
nor
the
appearance
of
our
room
was
improved
by
it
our
chambers
were
always
full
of
chemicals
and
of
criminal
relics
which
had
way
of
wandering
into
unlikely
positions
and
of
turning
up
in
the
butter
dish
or
in
even
less
desirable
places
but
his
papers
were
my
great
crux
he
had
horror
of
destroying
documents
especially
those
which
were
connected
with
his
past
cases
and
yet
it
was
only
once
in
every
year
or
two
that
he
would
muster
energy
to
docket
and
arrange
them
for
as
have
mentioned
somewhere
in
these
incoherent
memoirs
the
outbursts
of
passionate
energy
when
he
performed
the
remarkable
feats
with
which
his
name
is
associated
were
followed
by
reactions
of
lethargy
during
which
he
would
lie
about
with
his
violin
and
his
books
hardly
moving
save
fro
the
sofa
to
the
table
thus
month
after
month
his
papers
accumulated
until
every
corner
of
the
room
was
stacked
with
bundles
of
manuscript
which
were
on
no
account
to
be
burned
and
which
could
not
be
put
away
save
by
their
owner
one
winter
night
as
we
sat
together
by
the
fire
ventured
to
suggest
to
him
that
as
he
had
finished
pasting
extracts
into
his
common
place
book
he
might
employ
the
next
two
hours
in
making
our
room
little
more
habitable
he
could
not
deny
the
justice
of
my
request
so
with
rather
rueful
face
went
off
to
his
bedroom
from
which
he
returned
presently
pulling
large
tin
box
behind
him
this
he
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
squatting
down
upon
stool
in
front
of
it
he
threw
back
the
lid
could
see
that
it
was
already
third
full
of
bundles
of
paper
tied
up
with
red
tape
into
separate
packages
there
are
cases
enough
here
watson
said
he
looking
at
me
with
mischievous
eyes
think
that
if
you
knew
all
that
had
in
this
box
you
would
ask
me
to
pull
some
out
instead
of
putting
others
in
these
are
the
records
of
your
early
work
then
asked
have
often
wished
that
had
notes
of
those
cases
yes
my
boy
these
were
all
done
prematurely
before
my
biographer
had
come
to
glorify
me
he
lifted
bundle
after
bundle
in
tender
caressing
sort
of
way
they
are
not
all
successes
watson
said
he
but
there
are
some
pretty
little
problems
among
them
here
the
record
of
the
tarleton
murders
and
the
case
of
vamberry
the
wine
merchant
and
the
adventure
of
the
old
russian
woman
and
the
singular
affair
of
the
aluminium
crutch
as
well
as
full
account
of
ricoletti
of
the
club
foot
and
his
abominable
wife
and
here
ah
now
this
really
is
something
little
recherché
he
dived
his
arm
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
chest
and
brought
up
small
wooden
box
with
sliding
lid
such
as
children
toys
are
kept
in
from
within
he
produced
crumpled
piece
of
paper
and
old
fashioned
brass
key
peg
of
wood
with
ball
of
string
attached
to
it
and
three
rusty
old
disks
of
metal
well
my
boy
what
do
you
make
of
this
lot
he
asked
smiling
at
my
expression
it
is
curious
collection
very
curious
and
the
story
that
hangs
round
it
will
strike
you
as
being
more
curious
still
these
relics
have
history
then
so
much
so
that
they
are
history
what
do
you
mean
by
that
sherlock
holmes
picked
them
up
one
by
one
and
laid
them
along
the
edge
of
the
table
then
re
reseated
himself
in
his
chair
and
looked
them
over
with
gleam
of
satisfaction
in
his
eyes
these
said
he
are
all
that
have
left
to
remind
me
of
the
adventure
of
the
musgrave
ritual
had
heard
him
mention
the
case
more
than
once
though
had
never
been
able
to
gather
the
details
should
be
so
glad
said
if
you
would
give
me
an
account
of
it
and
leave
the
litter
as
it
is
he
cried
mischievously
your
tidiness
won
bear
much
strain
after
all
watson
but
should
be
glad
that
you
should
add
this
case
to
your
annals
for
there
are
points
in
it
which
make
it
quite
unique
in
the
criminal
records
of
this
or
believe
of
any
other
country
collection
of
my
trifling
achievements
would
certainly
be
incomplete
which
contained
no
account
of
this
very
singular
business
you
may
remember
how
the
affair
of
the
gloria
scott
and
my
conversation
with
the
unhappy
man
whose
fate
told
you
of
first
turned
my
attention
in
the
direction
of
the
profession
which
has
become
my
life
work
you
see
me
now
when
my
name
has
become
known
far
and
wide
and
when
am
generally
recognized
both
by
the
public
and
by
the
official
force
as
being
final
court
of
appeal
in
doubtful
cases
even
when
you
knew
me
first
at
the
time
of
the
affair
which
you
have
commemorated
in
study
in
scarlet
had
already
established
considerable
though
not
very
lucrative
connection
you
can
hardly
realize
then
how
difficult
found
it
at
first
and
how
long
had
to
wait
before
succeeded
in
making
any
headway
when
first
came
up
to
london
had
rooms
in
montague
street
just
round
the
corner
from
the
british
museum
and
there
waited
filling
in
my
too
abundant
leisure
time
by
studying
all
those
branches
of
science
which
might
make
me
more
efficient
now
and
again
cases
came
in
my
way
principally
through
the
introduction
of
old
fellow
students
for
during
my
last
years
at
the
university
there
was
good
deal
of
talk
there
about
myself
and
my
methods
the
third
of
these
cases
was
that
of
the
musgrave
ritual
and
it
is
to
the
interest
which
was
aroused
by
that
singular
chain
of
events
and
the
large
issues
which
proved
to
be
at
stake
that
trace
my
first
stride
towards
to
position
which

reginald
musgrave
had
been
in
the
same
college
as
myself
and
had
some
slight
acquaintance
with
him
he
was
not
generally
popular
among
the
undergraduates
though
it
always
seemed
to
me
that
what
was
set
down
as
pride
was
really
an
attempt
to
cover
extreme
natural
diffidence
in
appearance
he
was
man
of
exceedingly
aristocratic
type
thin
high
nosed
and
large
eyed
with
languid
and
yet
courtly
manners
he
was
indeed
scion
of
one
of
the
very
oldest
families
in
the
kingdom
though
his
branch
was
cadet
one
which
had
separated
from
the
northern
musgraves
some
time
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
had
established
itself
in
western
sussex
where
the
manor
house
of
hurlstone
is
perhaps
the
oldest
inhabited
building
in
the
county
something
of
his
birth
place
seemed
to
cling
to
the
man
and
never
looked
at
his
pale
keen
face
or
the
poise
of
his
head
without
associating
him
with
grey
archways
and
mullioned
windows
and
all
the
venerable
wreckage
of
feudal
keep
once
or
twice
we
drifted
into
talk
and
can
remember
that
more
than
once
he
expressed
keen
interest
in
my
methods
of
observation
and
inference
for
four
years
had
seen
nothing
of
him
until
one
morning
he
walked
into
my
room
in
montague
street
he
had
changed
little
was
dressed
like
young
man
of
fashion
he
was
always
bit
of
dandy
and
preserved
the
same
quiet
suave
manner
which
had
formerly
distinguished
him
how
has
all
gone
wit
you
musgrave
asked
after
we
had
cordially
shaken
hands
you
probably
heard
of
my
poor
father
death
said
he
was
carried
off
about
two
years
ago
since
then
have
of
course
had
the
hurlstone
estates
to
manage
and
as
am
member
for
my
district
as
well
my
life
has
been
busy
one
but
understand
holmes
that
you
are
turning
to
practical
ends
those
powers
with
which
you
used
to
amaze
us
yes
said
have
taken
to
living
by
my
wits
am
delighted
to
hear
it
for
your
advice
at
present
would
be
exceedingly
valuable
to
me
we
have
had
some
very
strange
doings
at
hurlstone
and
the
police
have
been
able
to
throw
no
light
upon
the
matter
it
is
really
the
most
extraordinary
and
inexplicable
business
you
can
imagine
with
what
eagerness
listened
to
him
watson
for
the
very
chance
for
which
had
been
panting
during
all
those
months
of
inaction
seemed
to
have
come
within
my
reach
in
my
inmost
heart
believed
that
could
succeed
where
others
failed
and
now
had
the
opportunity
to
test
myself
pray
let
me
have
the
details
cried
reginald
musgrave
sat
down
opposite
to
me
and
lit
the
cigarette
which
had
pushed
towards
him
you
must
know
said
he
that
though
am
bachelor
have
to
keep
up
considerable
staff
of
servants
at
hurlstone
for
it
is
rambling
old
place
and
takes
good
deal
of
looking
after
preserve
too
and
in
the
pheasant
months
usually
have
house
party
so
that
it
would
not
do
to
be
short
handed
altogether
there
are
eight
maids
the
cook
the
butler
two
footmen
and
boy
the
garden
and
the
stables
of
course
have
separate
staff
of
these
servants
the
one
who
had
been
longest
in
our
service
was
brunton
the
butler
he
was
young
school
master
out
of
place
when
he
was
first
taken
up
by
my
father
but
he
was
man
of
great
energy
and
character
and
he
soon
became
quite
invaluable
in
the
household
he
was
well
grown
handsome
man
with
splendid
forehead
and
though
he
has
been
with
us
for
twenty
years
he
cannot
be
more
than
forty
now
with
his
personal
advantages
and
his
extraordinary
gifts
for
he
can
speak
several
languages
and
play
nearly
every
musical
instrument
it
is
wonderful
that
he
should
have
been
satisfied
so
long
in
such
position
but
suppose
that
he
was
comfortable
and
lacked
energy
to
make
any
change
the
butler
of
hurlstone
is
always
thing
that
is
remembered
by
all
who
visit
us
but
this
paragon
has
one
fault
he
is
bit
of
don
juan
and
you
can
imagine
that
for
man
like
him
it
is
not
very
difficult
part
to
play
in
quiet
country
district
when
he
was
married
it
was
all
right
but
since
he
has
been
widower
we
have
had
no
end
of
trouble
with
him
few
months
ago
we
were
in
hopes
that
he
was
about
to
settle
down
again
for
he
became
engaged
to
rachel
howells
our
second
house
maid
but
he
has
thrown
her
over
since
then
and
taken
up
with
janet
tregellis
the
daughter
of
the
head
game
keeper
rachel
who
is
very
good
girl
but
of
an
excitable
welsh
temperament
had
sharp
touch
of
brain
fever
and
goes
about
the
house
now
or
did
until
yesterday
like
black
eyed
shadow
of
her
former
self
that
was
our
first
drama
at
hurlstone
but
second
one
came
to
drive
it
from
our
minds
and
it
was
prefaced
by
the
disgrace
and
dismissal
of
butler
brunton
this
was
how
it
came
about
have
said
that
the
man
was
intelligent
and
this
very
intelligence
has
caused
his
ruin
for
it
seems
to
have
led
to
an
insatiable
curiosity
about
things
which
did
not
in
the
least
concern
him
had
no
idea
of
the
lengths
to
which
this
would
carry
him
until
the
merest
accident
opened
my
eyes
to
it
have
said
that
the
house
is
rambling
one
day
last
week
on
thursday
night
to
be
more
exact
found
that
could
not
sleep
having
foolishly
taken
cup
of
strong
café
noir
after
my
dinner
after
struggling
against
it
until
two
in
the
morning
felt
that
it
was
quite
hopeless
so
rose
and
lit
the
candle
with
the
intention
of
continuing
novel
which
was
reading
the
book
however
had
been
left
in
the
billiard
room
so
pulled
on
my
dressing
gown
and
started
off
to
get
it
in
order
to
reach
the
billiard
room
had
to
descend
flight
of
stairs
and
then
to
cross
the
head
of
passage
which
led
to
the
library
and
the
gun
room
you
can
imagine
my
surprise
when
as
looked
down
this
corridor
saw
glimmer
of
light
coming
from
the
open
door
of
the
library
had
myself
extinguished
the
lamp
and
closed
the
door
before
coming
to
bed
naturally
my
first
thought
was
of
burglars
the
corridors
at
hurlstone
have
their
walls
largely
decorated
with
trophies
of
old
weapons
from
one
of
these
picked
battle
axe
and
then
leaving
my
candle
behind
me
crept
on
tiptoe
down
the
passage
and
peeped
in
at
the
open
door
brunton
the
butler
was
in
the
library
he
was
sitting
fully
dressed
in
an
easy
chair
with
slip
of
paper
which
looked
lake
map
upon
his
knee
and
his
forehead
sunk
forward
upon
his
hand
in
deep
thought
stood
dumb
with
astonishment
watching
him
from
the
darkness
small
taper
on
the
edge
of
the
table
shed
feeble
light
which
sufficed
to
show
me
that
he
was
fully
dressed
suddenly
as
looked
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
walking
over
to
bureau
at
the
side
he
unlocked
it
and
drew
out
one
of
the
drawers
from
this
he
took
paper
and
returning
to
his
seat
he
flattened
it
out
beside
the
taper
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
began
to
study
it
with
minute
attention
my
indignation
at
this
calm
examination
of
our
family
documents
overcame
me
so
far
that
took
step
forward
and
brunton
looking
up
saw
me
standing
in
the
doorway
he
sprang
to
his
feet
his
face
turned
livid
with
fear
and
he
thrust
into
his
breast
the
chart
like
paper
which
he
had
been
originally
studying
so
said
this
is
how
you
repay
the
trust
which
we
have
reposed
in
you
will
leave
my
service
to
morrow
he
bowed
with
the
look
of
man
who
is
utterly
crushed
and
slunk
past
me
without
word
the
taper
was
still
on
the
table
and
by
its
light
glanced
to
see
what
the
paper
was
which
brunton
had
taken
from
the
bureau
to
my
surprise
it
was
nothing
of
any
importance
at
all
but
simply
copy
of
the
questions
and
answers
in
the
singular
old
observance
called
the
musgrave
ritual
it
is
sort
of
ceremony
peculiar
to
our
family
which
each
musgrave
for
centuries
past
has
gone
through
on
his
coming
of
age
thing
of
private
interest
and
perhaps
of
some
little
importance
to
the
archaeologist
like
our
own
blazonings
and
charges
but
of
no
practical
use
whatever
we
had
better
come
back
to
the
paper
afterwards
said
if
you
think
it
really
necessary
he
answered
with
some
hesitation
to
continue
my
statement
however
relocked
the
bureau
using
the
key
which
brunton
had
left
and
had
turned
to
go
when
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
butler
had
returned
and
was
standing
before
me
mr
musgrave
sir
he
cried
in
voice
which
was
hoarse
with
emotion
can
bear
disgrace
sir
ve
always
been
proud
above
my
station
in
life
and
disgrace
would
kill
me
my
blood
will
be
on
your
head
sir
it
will
indeed
if
you
drive
me
to
despair
if
you
cannot
keep
me
after
what
has
passed
then
for
god
sake
let
me
give
you
notice
and
leave
in
month
as
if
of
my
own
free
will
could
stand
that
mr
musgrave
but
not
to
be
cast
out
before
all
the
folk
that
know
so
well
you
don
deserve
much
consideration
brunton
answered
your
conduct
has
been
most
infamous
however
as
you
have
been
long
time
in
the
family
have
no
wish
to
bring
public
disgrace
upon
you
month
however
is
too
long
take
yourself
away
in
week
and
give
what
reason
you
like
for
going

only
week
sir
he
cried
in
despairing
voice
fortnight
say
at
least
fortnight
week
repeated
and
you
may
consider
yourself
to
have
been
very
leniently
dealt
with
he
crept
away
his
face
sunk
upon
his
breast
like
broken
man
while
put
out
the
light
and
returned
to
my
room
for
two
days
after
this
brunton
was
most
assiduous
in
his
attention
to
his
duties
made
no
allusion
to
what
had
passed
and
waited
with
some
curiosity
to
see
how
he
would
cover
his
disgrace
on
the
third
morning
however
he
did
not
appear
as
was
his
custom
after
breakfast
to
receive
my
instructions
for
the
day
as
left
the
dining
room
happened
to
meet
rachel
howells
the
maid
have
told
you
that
she
had
only
recently
recovered
from
an
illness
and
was
looking
so
wretchedly
pale
and
wan
that
remonstrated
with
her
for
being
at
work
you
should
be
in
bed
said
come
back
to
your
duties
when
you
are
stronger
she
looked
at
me
with
so
strange
an
expression
that
began
to
suspect
that
her
brain
was
affected
am
strong
enough
mr
musgrave
said
she
we
will
see
what
the
doctor
says
answered
you
must
stop
work
now
and
when
you
go
downstairs
just
say
that
wish
to
see
brunton
the
butler
is
gone
said
she
gone
where
he
is
gone
no
one
has
seen
him
he
is
not
in
his
room
oh
yes
he
is
gone
he
is
gone
she
fell
back
against
the
wall
with
shriek
after
shriek
of
laughter
while
horrified
at
this
sudden
hysterical
attack
rushed
to
the
bell
to
summon
help
the
girl
was
taken
to
her
room
still
screaming
and
sobbing
while
made
inquiries
about
brunton
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
that
he
had
disappeared
his
bed
had
not
been
slept
in
he
had
been
seen
by
no
one
since
he
had
retired
to
his
room
the
night
before
and
yet
it
was
difficult
to
see
how
he
could
have
left
the
house
as
both
windows
and
doors
were
found
to
be
fastened
in
the
morning
his
clothes
his
watch
and
even
his
money
were
in
his
room
but
the
black
suit
which
he
usually
wore
was
missing
his
slippers
too
were
gone
but
his
boots
were
left
behind
where
then
could
butler
brunton
have
gone
in
the
night
and
what
could
have
become
of
him
now
of
course
we
searched
the
house
from
cellar
to
garret
but
there
was
no
trace
of
him
it
is
as
have
said
labyrinth
of
an
old
house
especially
the
original
wing
which
is
now
practically
uninhabited
but
we
ransacked
every
room
and
cellar
without
discovering
the
least
sign
of
the
missing
man
it
was
incredible
to
me
that
he
could
have
gone
away
leaving
all
his
property
behind
him
and
yet
where
could
he
be
called
in
the
local
police
but
without
success
rain
had
fallen
on
the
night
before
and
we
examined
the
lawn
and
the
paths
all
round
the
house
but
in
vain
matters
were
in
this
state
when
new
development
quite
drew
our
attention
away
from
the
original
mystery
for
two
days
rachel
howells
had
been
so
ill
sometimes
delirious
sometimes
hysterical
that
nurse
had
been
employed
to
sit
up
with
her
at
night
on
the
third
night
after
brunton
disappearance
the
nurse
finding
her
patient
sleeping
nicely
had
dropped
into
nap
in
the
arm
chair
when
shoe
woke
in
the
early
morning
to
find
the
bed
empty
the
window
open
and
no
signs
of
the
invalid
was
instantly
aroused
and
with
the
two
footmen
started
off
at
once
in
search
of
the
missing
girl
it
was
not
difficult
to
tell
the
direction
which
she
had
taken
for
starting
from
under
her
window
we
could
follow
her
footmarks
easily
across
the
lawn
to
the
edge
of
the
mere
where
they
vanished
close
to
the
gravel
path
which
leads
out
of
the
grounds
the
lake
there
is
eight
feet
deep
and
you
can
imagine
our
feelings
when
we
saw
that
the
trail
of
the
poor
demented
girl
came
to
an
end
at
the
edge
of
it
of
course
we
had
the
drags
at
once
and
set
to
work
to
recover
the
remains
but
no
trace
of
the
body
could
we
find
on
the
other
hand
we
brought
to
the
surface
an
object
of
most
unexpected
kind
it
was
linen
bag
which
contained
within
it
mass
of
old
rusted
and
discoloured
metal
and
several
dull
coloured
pieces
of
pebble
or
glass
this
strange
find
was
all
that
we
could
get
from
the
mere
and
although
we
made
every
possible
search
and
inquiry
yesterday
we
know
nothing
of
the
fate
either
of
rachel
howells
or
of
richard
brunton
the
county
police
are
at
their
wits
end
and
have
come
up
to
you
as
last
resource
you
can
imagine
watson
with
what
eagerness
listened
to
this
extraordinary
sequence
of
events
and
endeavored
to
piece
them
together
and
to
devise
some
common
thread
upon
which
they
might
all
hang
the
butler
was
gone
the
maid
was
gone
the
maid
had
loved
the
butler
but
had
afterwards
had
cause
to
hate
him
she
was
of
welsh
blood
fiery
and
passionate
she
had
been
terribly
excited
immediately
after
his
disappearance
she
had
flung
into
the
lake
bag
containing
some
curious
contents
these
were
all
factors
which
had
to
be
taken
into
consideration
and
yet
none
of
them
got
quite
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
what
was
the
starting
point
of
this
chain
of
events
there
lay
the
end
of
this
tangled
line
must
see
that
paper
musgrave
said
which
this
butler
of
your
thought
it
worth
his
while
to
consult
even
at
the
risk
of
the
loss
of
his
place
it
is
rather
an
absurd
business
this
ritual
of
ours
he
answered
but
it
has
at
least
the
saving
grace
of
antiquity
to
excuse
it
have
copy
of
the
questions
and
answers
here
if
you
care
to
run
your
eye
over
them
he
handed
me
the
very
paper
which
have
here
watson
and
this
is
the
strange
catechism
to
which
each
musgrave
had
to
submit
when
he
came
to
man
estate
will
read
you
the
questions
and
answers
as
they
stand
whose
was
it
his
who
is
gone
who
shall
have
it
he
who
will
come
where
was
the
sun
over
the
oak
where
was
the
shadow
under
the
elm
how
was
it
stepped
north
by
ten
and
by
ten
east
by
five
and
by
five
south
by
two
and
by
two
west
by
one
and
by
one
and
so
under
what
shall
we
give
for
it
all
that
is
ours
why
should
we
give
it
for
the
sake
of
the
trust
the
original
has
no
date
but
is
in
the
spelling
of
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
remarked
musgrave
am
afraid
however
that
it
can
be
of
little
help
to
you
in
solving
this
mystery
at
least
said
it
gives
us
another
mystery
and
one
which
is
even
more
interesting
than
the
first
it
may
be
that
the
solution
of
the
one
may
prove
to
be
the
solution
of
the
other
you
will
excuse
me
musgrave
if
say
that
your
butler
appears
to
me
to
have
been
very
clever
man
and
to
have
had
clearer
insight
that
ten
generations
of
his
masters
hardly
follow
you
said
musgrave
the
paper
seems
to
me
to
be
of
no
practical
importance
but
to
me
it
seems
immensely
practical
and
fancy
that
brunton
took
the
same
view
he
had
probably
seen
it
before
that
night
on
which
you
caught
him
it
is
very
possible
we
took
no
pains
to
hide
it
he
simply
wished
should
imagine
to
refresh
his
memory
upon
that
last
occasion
he
had
as
understand
some
sort
of
map
or
chart
which
he
was
comparing
with
the
manuscript
and
which
he
thrust
into
his
pocket
when
you
appeared
that
is
true
but
what
could
he
have
to
do
with
this
old
family
custom
of
ours
and
what
does
this
rigmarole
mean
don
think
that
we
should
have
much
difficulty
in
determining
that
said
with
your
permission
we
will
take
the
first
train
down
to
sussex
and
go
little
more
deeply
into
the
matter
upon
the
spot
the
same
afternoon
saw
us
both
at
hurlstone
possibly
you
have
seen
pictures
and
read
descriptions
of
the
famous
old
building
so
will
confine
my
account
of
it
to
saying
that
it
is
built
in
the
shape
of
an
the
long
arm
being
the
more
modern
portion
and
the
shorter
the
ancient
nucleus
from
which
the
other
had
developed
over
the
low
heavily
lintelled
door
in
the
centre
of
this
old
part
is
chiseled
the
date
1607
but
experts
are
agreed
that
the
beams
and
stone
work
are
really
much
older
than
this
the
enormously
thick
walls
and
tiny
windows
of
this
part
had
in
the
last
century
driven
the
family
into
building
the
new
wing
and
the
old
one
was
used
now
as
store
house
and
cellar
when
it
was
used
at
all
splendid
park
with
fine
old
timber
surrounds
the
house
and
the
lake
to
which
my
client
had
referred
lay
close
to
the
avenue
about
tow
hundred
yards
from
the
building
was
already
firmly
convinced
watson
that
there
were
not
three
separate
mysteries
here
but
one
only
and
that
if
could
read
the
musgrave
ritual
aright
should
hold
in
my
hand
the
clue
which
would
lead
me
to
the
truth
concerning
both
the
butler
brunton
and
the
maid
howells
to
that
then
turned
all
my
energies
why
should
this
servant
be
so
anxious
to
master
this
old
formula
evidently
because
he
saw
something
in
it
which
had
escaped
all
those
generations
of
country
squires
and
from
which
he
expected
some
personal
advantage
what
was
it
then
and
how
had
it
affected
his
fate

it
was
perfectly
obvious
to
me
on
reading
the
ritual
that
the
measurements
must
refer
to
some
spot
to
which
the
rest
of
the
document
alluded
and
that
if
we
could
find
that
spot
we
should
be
in
fair
way
towards
finding
what
the
secret
was
which
the
old
musgraves
had
thought
it
necessary
to
embalm
in
so
curious
fashion
there
were
two
guides
given
us
to
start
with
an
oak
and
an
elm
as
to
the
oak
there
could
be
no
question
at
all
right
in
front
of
the
house
upon
the
left
hand
side
of
the
drive
there
stood
patriarch
among
oaks
one
of
the
most
magnificent
trees
that
have
ever
seen
that
was
there
when
you
ritual
was
drawn
up
said
as
we
drove
past
it
was
there
at
the
norman
conquest
in
all
probability
he
answered
it
has
girth
of
twenty
three
feet
have
you
any
old
elms
asked
there
used
to
be
very
old
one
over
yonder
but
it
was
struck
by
lightning
ten
years
ago
and
we
cut
down
the
stump
you
can
see
where
it
used
to
be
oh
yes
there
are
no
other
elms
no
old
ones
but
plenty
of
beeches
should
like
to
see
where
it
grew
we
had
driven
up
in
dogcart
and
my
client
led
me
away
at
once
without
our
entering
the
house
to
the
scar
on
the
lawn
where
the
elm
had
stood
it
was
nearly
midway
between
the
oak
and
the
house
my
investigation
seemed
to
be
progressing
suppose
it
is
impossible
to
find
out
how
high
the
elm
was
asked
can
give
you
it
at
once
it
was
sixty
four
feet
how
do
you
come
to
know
it
asked
in
surprise
when
my
old
tutor
used
to
give
me
an
exercise
in
trigonometry
it
always
took
the
shape
of
measuring
heights
when
was
lad
worked
out
every
tree
and
building
in
the
estate
this
was
an
unexpected
piece
of
luck
my
data
were
coming
more
quickly
than
could
have
reasonably
hoped
tell
me
asked
did
your
butler
ever
ask
you
such
question
reginald
musgrave
looked
at
me
in
astonishment
now
that
you
call
it
to
my
mind
he
answered
brunton
did
ask
me
about
the
height
of
the
tree
some
months
ago
in
connection
with
some
little
argument
with
the
groom
this
was
excellent
news
watson
for
it
showed
me
that
was
on
the
right
road
looked
up
at
the
sun
it
was
low
in
the
heavens
and
calculated
that
in
less
than
an
hour
it
would
lie
just
above
the
topmost
branches
of
the
old
oak
one
condition
mentioned
in
the
ritual
would
then
be
fulfilled
and
the
shadow
of
the
elm
must
mean
the
farther
end
of
the
shadow
otherwise
the
trunk
would
have
been
chosen
as
the
guide
had
then
to
find
where
the
far
end
of
the
shadow
would
fall
when
the
sun
was
just
clear
of
the
oak
that
must
have
been
difficult
holmes
when
the
elm
was
no
longer
there
well
at
least
knew
that
if
brunton
could
do
it
could
also
besides
there
was
no
real
difficulty
went
with
musgrave
to
his
study
and
whittled
myself
this
peg
to
which
tied
this
long
string
with
knot
at
each
yard
then
took
two
lengths
of
fishing
rod
which
came
to
just
six
feet
and
went
back
with
my
client
to
where
the
elm
had
been
the
sun
was
just
grazing
the
top
of
the
oak
fastened
the
rod
on
end
marked
out
the
direction
of
the
shadow
and
measured
it
was
nine
feet
in
length
of
course
the
calculation
now
was
simple
one
if
rod
of
six
feet
threw
shadow
of
nine
tree
of
sixty
four
feet
would
throw
one
of
ninety
six
and
the
line
of
the
one
would
of
course
the
line
of
the
other
measured
out
the
distance
which
brought
me
almost
to
the
wall
of
the
house
and
thrust
peg
into
the
spot
you
can
imagine
my
exultation
watson
when
within
two
inches
of
my
peg
saw
conical
depression
in
the
ground
knew
that
it
was
the
mark
made
by
brunton
in
his
measurements
and
that
was
still
upon
his
trail
from
this
starting
point
proceeded
to
step
having
first
taken
the
cardinal
points
by
my
pocket
compass
ten
steps
with
each
foot
took
me
along
parallel
with
the
wall
of
the
house
and
again
marked
my
spot
with
peg
then
carefully
paced
off
five
to
the
east
and
two
to
the
south
it
brought
me
to
the
very
threshold
of
the
old
door
two
steps
to
the
west
meant
now
that
was
to
go
two
paces
down
the
stone
flagged
passage
and
this
was
the
place
indicated
by
the
ritual
never
have
felt
such
cold
chill
of
disappointment
watson
for
moment
is
seemed
to
me
that
there
must
be
some
radical
mistake
in
my
calculations
the
setting
sun
shone
full
upon
the
passage
floor
and
could
see
that
the
old
foot
worn
grey
stones
with
which
it
was
paved
were
firmly
cemented
together
and
had
certainly
not
been
moved
for
many
long
year
brunton
had
not
been
at
work
here
tapped
upon
the
floor
but
it
sounded
the
same
all
over
and
there
was
no
sign
of
any
crack
or
crevice
but
fortunately
musgrave
who
had
begun
to
appreciate
the
meaning
of
my
proceedings
and
who
was
now
as
excited
as
myself
took
out
his
manuscript
to
check
my
calculation
and
under
he
cried
you
have
omitted
the
and
under
had
thought
that
it
meant
that
we
were
to
dig
but
now
of
course
saw
at
once
that
was
wrong
there
is
cellar
under
this
then
cried
yes
and
as
old
as
the
house
down
here
through
this
door
we
went
down
winding
stone
stair
and
my
companion
striking
match
lit
large
lantern
which
stood
on
barrel
in
the
corner
in
an
instant
it
was
obvious
that
we
had
at
last
come
upon
the
true
place
and
that
we
had
not
been
the
only
people
to
visit
the
spot
recently
it
had
been
used
for
the
storage
of
wood
but
the
billets
which
had
evidently
been
littered
over
the
floor
were
now
piled
at
the
sides
so
as
to
leave
clear
space
in
the
middle
in
this
space
lay
large
and
heavy
flagstone
with
rusted
iron
ring
in
the
centre
to
which
thick
shepherd
check
muffler
was
attached
by
jove
cried
my
client
that
brunton
muffler
have
seen
it
on
him
and
could
swear
to
it
what
has
the
villain
been
doing
here
at
my
suggestion
couple
of
the
county
police
were
summoned
to
be
present
and
then
endeavored
to
raise
the
stone
by
pulling
on
the
cravat
could
only
move
it
slightly
and
it
was
with
the
aid
of
one
of
the
constables
that
succeeded
at
last
in
carrying
it
to
one
side
black
hole
yawned
beneath
into
which
we
all
peered
while
musgrave
kneeling
at
the
side
pushed
down
the
lantern
small
chamber
about
seven
feet
deep
and
four
feet
square
lay
open
to
us
at
one
side
of
this
was
squat
brass
bound
wooden
box
the
lid
of
which
was
hinged
upwards
with
this
curious
old
fashioned
key
projecting
from
the
lock
it
was
furred
outside
by
thick
layer
of
dust
and
damp
and
worms
had
eaten
through
the
wood
so
that
crop
of
livid
fungi
was
growing
on
the
inside
of
it
several
discs
of
metal
old
coins
apparently
such
as
hold
here
were
scattered
over
the
bottom
of
the
box
but
it
contained
nothing
else
at
the
moment
however
we
had
no
thought
for
the
old
chest
for
our
eyes
were
riveted
upon
that
which
crouched
beside
it
was
the
figure
of
man
clad
in
suit
of
black
who
squatted
down
upon
him
hams
with
his
forehead
sunk
upon
the
edge
of
the
box
and
his
two
arms
thrown
out
on
each
side
of
it
the
attitude
had
drawn
all
the
stagnant
blood
to
the
face
and
no
man
could
have
recognized
that
distorted
liver
coloured
countenance
but
his
height
his
dress
and
his
hair
were
all
sufficient
to
show
my
client
when
we
had
drawn
the
body
up
that
it
was
indeed
his
missing
butler
he
had
been
dead
some
days
but
there
was
no
wound
or
bruise
upon
his
person
to
show
how
he
had
met
his
dreadful
end
when
his
body
had
been
carried
from
the
cellar
we
found
ourselves
still
confronted
with
problem
which
was
almost
as
formidable
as
that
with
which
we
had
started
confess
that
so
far
watson
had
been
disappointed
in
my
investigation
had
reckoned
upon
solving
the
matter
when
once
had
found
the
place
referred
to
in
the
ritual
but
now
was
there
and
was
apparently
as
far
as
ever
from
knowing
what
it
was
which
the
family
had
concealed
with
such
elaborate
precautions
it
is
true
that
had
thrown
light
upon
the
fate
of
brunton
but
now
had
to
ascertain
how
that
fate
had
come
upon
him
and
what
part
had
been
played
in
the
matter
by
the
woman
who
had
disappeared
sat
down
upon
keg
in
the
corner
and
thought
the
whole
matter
carefully
over
you
know
my
methods
in
such
cases
watson
put
myself
in
the
man
place
and
having
first
gauged
his
intelligence
try
to
imagine
how
should
myself
have
proceeded
under
the
same
circumstances
in
this
case
the
matter
was
simplified
by
brunton
intelligence
being
quite
first
rate
so
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
make
any
allowance
for
the
personal
equation
as
the
astronomers
have
dubbed
it
he
know
that
something
valuable
was
concealed
he
had
spotted
the
place
he
found
that
the
stone
which
covered
it
was
just
too
heavy
for
man
to
move
unaided
what
would
he
do
next
he
could
not
get
help
from
outside
even
if
he
had
some
one
whom
he
could
trust
without
the
unbarring
of
doors
and
considerable
risk
of
detection
it
was
better
if
he
could
to
have
his
helpmate
inside
the
house
but
whom
could
he
ask
this
girl
had
been
devoted
to
him
man
always
finds
it
hard
to
realize
that
he
may
have
finally
lost
woman
love
however
badly
he
may
have
treated
her
he
would
try
by
few
attentions
to
make
his
peace
with
the
girl
howells
and
then
would
engage
her
as
his
accomplice
together
they
would
come
at
night
to
the
cellar
and
their
united
force
would
suffice
to
raise
the
stone
so
far
could
follow
their
actions
as
if
had
actually
seen
them

but
for
two
of
them
and
one
woman
it
must
have
been
heavy
work
the
raising
of
that
stone
burly
sussex
policeman
and
had
found
it
no
light
job
what
would
they
do
to
assist
them
probably
what
should
have
done
myself
rose
and
examined
carefully
the
different
billets
of
wood
which
were
scattered
round
the
floor
almost
at
once
came
upon
what
expected
one
piece
about
three
feet
in
length
had
very
marked
indentation
at
one
end
while
several
were
flattened
at
the
sides
as
if
they
had
been
compressed
by
some
considerable
weight
evidently
as
they
had
dragged
the
stone
up
they
had
thrust
the
chunks
of
wood
into
the
chink
until
at
last
when
the
opening
was
large
enough
to
crawl
through
they
would
hold
it
open
by
billet
placed
lengthwise
which
might
very
well
become
indented
at
the
lower
end
since
the
whole
weight
of
the
stone
would
press
it
down
on
to
the
edge
of
this
other
slab
so
far
was
still
on
safe
ground
and
now
how
was
to
proceed
to
reconstruct
this
midnight
drama
clearly
only
one
could
fit
into
the
hole
and
that
one
was
brunton
the
girl
must
have
waited
above
brunton
then
unlocked
the
box
handed
up
the
contents
presumably
since
they
were
not
to
be
found
and
then
and
then
what
happened
what
smouldering
fire
of
vengeance
had
suddenly
sprung
into
flame
in
this
passionate
celtic
woman
soul
when
she
saw
the
man
who
had
wronged
her
wronged
her
perhaps
far
more
than
we
suspected
in
her
power
was
it
chance
that
the
wood
had
slipped
and
that
the
stone
had
shut
brunton
into
what
had
become
his
sepulchre
had
she
only
been
guilty
of
silence
as
to
his
fate
or
had
some
sudden
blow
from
her
hand
dashed
the
support
away
and
sent
the
slab
crashing
down
into
its
place
be
that
as
it
might
seemed
to
see
that
woman
figure
still
clutching
at
her
treasure
trove
and
flying
wildly
up
the
winding
stair
with
her
ears
ringing
perhaps
with
the
muffled
screams
from
behind
her
and
with
the
drumming
of
frenzied
hands
against
the
slab
of
stone
which
was
choking
her
faithless
lover
life
out
here
was
the
secret
of
her
blanched
face
her
shaken
nerves
her
peals
of
hysterical
laughter
on
the
next
morning
but
what
had
been
in
the
box
what
had
she
done
with
that
of
course
it
must
have
been
the
old
metal
and
pebbles
which
my
client
had
dragged
from
the
mere
she
had
thrown
them
in
there
at
the
first
opportunity
to
remove
the
last
trace
of
her
crime
for
twenty
minutes
had
sat
motionless
thinking
the
matter
out
musgrave
still
stood
with
very
pale
face
swinging
his
lantern
and
peering
down
into
the
hole
these
are
coins
of
charles
the
first
said
he
holding
out
the
few
which
had
been
in
the
box
you
see
we
were
right
in
fixing
our
date
for
the
ritual
we
may
find
something
else
of
charles
the
first
cried
as
the
probable
meaning
of
the
first
two
question
of
the
ritual
broke
suddenly
upon
me
let
me
see
the
contents
of
the
bag
which
you
fished
from
the
mere
we
ascended
to
his
study
and
he
laid
the
debris
before
me
could
understand
his
regarding
it
as
of
small
importance
when
looked
at
it
for
the
metal
was
almost
black
and
the
stones
lustreless
and
dull
rubbed
one
of
them
on
my
sleeve
however
and
it
glowed
afterwards
like
spark
in
the
dark
hollow
of
my
hand
the
metal
work
was
in
the
form
of
double
ring
but
it
had
been
bent
and
twisted
out
of
its
original
shape
you
must
bear
in
mind
said
that
the
royal
party
made
head
in
england
even
after
the
death
of
the
king
and
that
when
they
at
last
fled
they
probably
left
many
of
their
most
precious
possession
buried
behind
them
with
the
intention
of
returning
for
them
in
more
peaceful
times
my
ancestor
sir
ralph
musgrave
as
prominent
cavalier
and
the
right
hand
man
of
charles
the
second
in
his
wanderings
said
my
friend
ah
indeed
answered
well
now
think
that
really
should
give
us
the
last
link
that
we
wanted
must
congratulate
you
on
coming
into
the
possession
though
in
rather
tragic
manner
of
relic
which
is
of
great
intrinsic
value
but
of
even
greater
importance
as
an
historical
curiosity
what
is
it
then
he
gasped
in
astonishment
it
is
nothing
less
than
the
ancient
crown
of
the
kings
of
england
the
crown
precisely
consider
what
the
ritual
says
how
does
it
run
whose
was
it
his
who
is
gone
that
was
after
the
execution
of
charles
then
who
shall
have
it
he
who
will
come
that
was
charles
the
second
whose
advent
was
already
foreseen
there
can
think
be
no
doubt
that
this
battered
and
shapeless
diadem
once
encircled
the
brows
of
the
royal
stuarts
and
how
came
it
in
the
pond
ah
that
is
question
that
will
take
some
time
to
answer
and
with
that
sketched
out
to
him
the
whole
long
chain
of
surmise
and
of
proof
which
had
constructed
the
twilight
had
closed
in
and
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
in
the
sky
before
my
narrative
was
finished
and
how
was
it
then
that
charles
did
not
get
his
crown
when
he
returned
asked
musgrave
pushing
back
the
relic
into
its
linen
bag
ah
there
you
lay
your
finger
upon
the
one
point
which
we
shall
probably
never
be
able
to
clear
up
it
is
likely
that
the
musgrave
who
held
the
secret
died
in
the
interval
and
by
some
oversight
left
this
guide
to
his
descendant
without
explaining
the
meaning
of
it
from
that
day
to
this
it
has
been
handed
down
from
father
to
son
until
at
last
it
came
within
reach
of
man
who
tore
its
secret
out
of
it
and
lost
his
life
in
the
venture
and
that
the
story
of
the
musgrave
ritual
watson
they
have
the
crown
down
at
hurlstone
though
they
had
some
legal
bother
and
considerable
sum
to
pay
before
they
were
allowed
to
retain
it
am
sure
that
if
you
mentioned
my
name
they
would
be
happy
to
show
it
to
you
of
the
woman
nothing
was
ever
heard
and
the
probability
is
that
she
got
away
out
of
england
and
carried
herself
and
the
memory
of
her
crime
to
some
land
beyond
the
seas
vi
the
reigate
puzzle
it
was
some
time
before
the
health
of
my
friend
mr
sherlock
holmes
recovered
from
the
strain
caused
by
his
immense
exertions
in
the
spring
of
87
the
whole
question
of
the
netherland
sumatra
company
and
of
the
colossal
schemes
of
baron
maupertuis
are
too
recent
in
the
minds
of
the
public
and
are
too
intimately
concerned
with
politics
and
finance
to
be
fitting
subjects
for
this
series
of
sketches
they
led
however
in
an
indirect
fashion
to
singular
and
complex
problem
which
gave
my
friend
an
opportunity
of
demonstrating
the
value
of
fresh
weapon
among
the
many
with
which
he
waged
his
life
long
battle
against
crime
on
referring
to
my
notes
see
that
it
was
upon
the
14th
of
april
that
received
telegram
from
lyons
which
informed
me
that
holmes
was
lying
ill
in
the
hotel
dulong
within
twenty
four
hours
was
in
his
sick
room
and
was
relieved
to
find
that
there
was
nothing
formidable
in
his
symptoms
even
his
iron
constitution
however
had
broken
down
under
the
strain
of
an
investigation
which
had
extended
over
two
months
during
which
period
he
had
never
worked
less
than
fifteen
hours
day
and
had
more
than
once
as
he
assured
me
kept
to
his
task
for
five
days
at
stretch
even
the
triumphant
issue
of
his
labors
could
not
save
him
from
reaction
after
so
terrible
an
exertion
and
at
time
when
europe
was
ringing
with
his
name
and
when
his
room
was
literally
ankle
deep
with
congratulatory
telegrams
found
him
prey
to
the
blackest
depression
even
the
knowledge
that
he
had
succeeded
where
the
police
of
three
countries
had
failed
and
that
he
had
outmanoeuvred
at
every
point
the
most
accomplished
swindler
in
europe
was
insufficient
to
rouse
him
from
his
nervous
prostration
three
days
later
we
were
back
in
baker
street
together
but
it
was
evident
that
my
friend
would
be
much
the
better
for
change
and
the
thought
of
week
of
spring
time
in
the
country
was
full
of
attractions
to
me
also
my
old
friend
colonel
hayter
who
had
come
under
my
professional
care
in
afghanistan
had
now
taken
house
near
reigate
in
surrey
and
had
frequently
asked
me
to
come
down
to
him
upon
visit
on
the
last
occasion
he
had
remarked
that
if
my
friend
would
only
come
with
me
he
would
be
glad
to
extend
his
hospitality
to
him
also
little
diplomacy
was
needed
but
when
holmes
understood
that
the
establishment
was
bachelor
one
and
that
he
would
be
allowed
the
fullest
freedom
he
fell
in
with
my
plans
and
week
after
our
return
from
lyons
we
were
under
the
colonel
roof
hayter
was
fine
old
soldier
who
had
seen
much
of
the
world
and
he
soon
found
as
had
expected
that
holmes
and
he
had
much
in
common
on
the
evening
of
our
arrival
we
were
sitting
in
the
colonel
gun
room
after
dinner
holmes
stretched
upon
the
sofa
while
hayter
and
looked
over
his
little
armoury
of
eastern
weapons
by
the
way
said
he
suddenly
think
ll
take
one
of
these
pistols
upstairs
with
me
in
case
we
have
an
alarm

an
alarm
said
yes
we
ve
had
scare
in
this
part
lately
old
acton
who
is
one
of
our
county
magnates
had
his
house
broken
into
last
monday
no
great
damage
done
but
the
fellows
are
still
at
large
no
clue
asked
holmes
cocking
his
eye
at
the
colonel
none
as
yet
but
the
affair
is
pretty
one
of
our
little
country
crimes
which
must
seem
too
small
for
your
attention
mr
holmes
after
this
great
international
affair
holmes
waved
away
the
compliment
though
his
smile
showed
that
it
had
pleased
him
was
there
any
feature
of
interest
fancy
not
the
thieves
ransacked
the
library
and
got
very
little
for
their
pains
the
whole
place
was
turned
upside
down
drawers
burst
open
and
presses
ransacked
with
the
result
that
an
odd
volume
of
pope
homer
two
plated
candlesticks
an
ivory
letter
weight
small
oak
barometer
and
ball
of
twine
are
all
that
have
vanished
what
an
extraordinary
assortment
exclaimed
oh
the
fellows
evidently
grabbed
hold
of
everything
they
could
get
holmes
grunted
from
the
sofa
the
county
police
ought
to
make
something
of
that
said
he
why
it
is
surely
obvious
that—
but
held
up
warning
finger
you
are
here
for
rest
my
dear
fellow
for
heaven
sake
don
get
started
on
new
problem
when
your
nerves
are
all
in
shreds
holmes
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
glance
of
comic
resignation
towards
the
colonel
and
the
talk
drifted
away
into
less
dangerous
channels
it
was
destined
however
that
all
my
professional
caution
should
be
wasted
for
next
morning
the
problem
obtruded
itself
upon
us
in
such
way
that
it
was
impossible
to
ignore
it
and
our
country
visit
took
turn
which
neither
of
us
could
have
anticipated
we
were
at
breakfast
when
the
colonel
butler
rushed
in
with
all
his
propriety
shaken
out
of
him
have
you
heard
the
news
sir
he
gasped
at
the
cunningham
sir
burglary
cried
the
colonel
with
his
coffee
cup
in
mid
air
murder
the
colonel
whistled
by
jove
said
he
who
killed
then
the
or
his
son
neither
sir
it
was
william
the
coachman
shot
through
the
heart
sir
and
never
spoke
again
who
shot
him
then
the
burglar
sir
he
was
off
like
shot
and
got
clean
away
he
just
broke
in
at
the
pantry
window
when
william
came
on
him
and
met
his
end
in
saving
his
master
property
what
time
it
was
last
night
sir
somewhere
about
twelve
ah
then
we
ll
step
over
afterwards
said
the
colonel
coolly
settling
down
to
his
breakfast
again
it
baddish
business
he
added
when
the
butler
had
gone
he
our
leading
man
about
here
is
old
cunningham
and
very
decent
fellow
too
he
ll
be
cut
up
over
this
for
the
man
has
been
in
his
service
for
years
and
was
good
servant
it
evidently
the
same
villains
who
broke
into
acton
and
stole
that
very
singular
collection
said
holmes
thoughtfully
precisely
hum
it
may
prove
the
simplest
matter
in
the
world
but
all
the
same
at
first
glance
this
is
just
little
curious
is
it
not
gang
of
burglars
acting
in
the
country
might
be
expected
to
vary
the
scene
of
their
operations
and
not
to
crack
two
cribs
in
the
same
district
within
few
days
when
you
spoke
last
night
of
taking
precautions
remember
that
it
passed
through
my
mind
that
this
was
probably
the
last
parish
in
england
to
which
the
thief
or
thieves
would
be
likely
to
turn
their
attention
which
shows
that
have
still
much
to
learn
fancy
it
some
local
practitioner
said
the
colonel
in
that
case
of
course
acton
and
cunningham
are
just
the
places
he
would
go
for
since
they
are
far
the
largest
about
here
and
richest
well
they
ought
to
be
but
they
ve
had
lawsuit
for
some
years
which
has
sucked
the
blood
out
of
both
of
them
fancy
old
acton
has
some
claim
on
half
cunningham
estate
and
the
lawyers
have
been
at
it
with
both
hands
if
it
local
villain
there
should
not
be
much
difficulty
in
running
him
down
said
holmes
with
yawn
all
right
watson
don
intend
to
meddle
inspector
forrester
sir
said
the
butler
throwing
open
the
door
the
official
smart
keen
faced
young
fellow
stepped
into
the
room
good
morning
colonel
said
he
hope
don
intrude
but
we
hear
that
mr
holmes
of
baker
street
is
here
the
colonel
waved
his
hand
towards
my
friend
and
the
inspector
bowed
we
thought
that
perhaps
you
would
care
to
step
across
mr
holmes
the
fates
are
against
you
watson
said
he
laughing
we
were
chatting
about
the
matter
when
you
came
in
inspector
perhaps
you
can
let
us
have
few
details
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
in
the
familiar
attitude
knew
that
the
case
was
hopeless
we
had
no
clue
in
the
acton
affair
but
here
we
have
plenty
to
go
on
and
there
no
doubt
it
is
the
same
party
in
each
case
the
man
was
seen
ah
yes
sir
but
he
was
off
like
deer
after
the
shot
that
killed
poor
william
kirwan
was
fired
mr
cunningham
saw
him
from
the
bedroom
window
and
mr
alec
cunningham
saw
him
from
the
back
passage
it
was
quarter
to
twelve
when
the
alarm
broke
out
mr
cunningham
had
just
got
into
bed
and
mr
alec
was
smoking
pipe
in
his
dressing
gown
they
both
heard
william
the
coachman
calling
for
help
and
mr
alec
ran
down
to
see
what
was
the
matter
the
back
door
was
open
and
as
he
came
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
saw
two
men
wrestling
together
outside
one
of
them
fired
shot
the
other
dropped
and
the
murderer
rushed
across
the
garden
and
over
the
hedge
mr
cunningham
looking
out
of
his
bedroom
saw
the
fellow
as
he
gained
the
road
but
lost
sight
of
him
at
once
mr
alec
stopped
to
see
if
he
could
help
the
dying
man
and
so
the
villain
got
clean
away
beyond
the
fact
that
he
was
middle
sized
man
and
dressed
in
some
dark
stuff
we
have
no
personal
clue
but
we
are
making
energetic
inquiries
and
if
he
is
stranger
we
shall
soon
find
him
out
what
was
this
william
doing
there
did
he
say
anything
before
he
died
not
word
he
lives
at
the
lodge
with
his
mother
and
as
he
was
very
faithful
fellow
we
imagine
that
he
walked
up
to
the
house
with
the
intention
of
seeing
that
all
was
right
there
of
course
this
acton
business
has
put
every
one
on
their
guard
the
robber
must
have
just
burst
open
the
door
the
lock
has
been
forced
when
william
came
upon
him
did
william
say
anything
to
his
mother
before
going
out
she
is
very
old
and
deaf
and
we
can
get
no
information
from
her
the
shock
has
made
her
half
witted
but
understand
that
she
was
never
very
bright
there
is
one
very
important
circumstance
however
look
at
this
he
took
small
piece
of
torn
paper
from
note
book
and
spread
it
out
upon
his
knee
this
was
found
between
the
finger
and
thumb
of
the
dead
man
it
appears
to
be
fragment
torn
from
larger
sheet
you
will
observe
that
the
hour
mentioned
upon
it
is
the
very
time
at
which
the
poor
fellow
met
his
fate
you
see
that
his
murderer
might
have
torn
the
rest
of
the
sheet
from
him
or
he
might
have
taken
this
fragment
from
the
murderer
it
reads
almost
as
though
it
were
an
appointment
holmes
took
up
the
scrap
of
paper
fac
simile
of
which
is
here
reproduced
at
quarter
to
twelve
learn
what
maybe
presuming
that
it
is
an
appointment
continued
the
inspector
it
is
of
course
conceivable
theory
that
this
william
kirwan
though
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
an
honest
man
may
have
been
in
league
with
the
thief
he
may
have
met
him
there
may
even
have
helped
him
to
break
in
the
door
and
then
they
may
have
fallen
out
between
themselves
this
writing
is
of
extraordinary
interest
said
holmes
who
had
been
examining
it
with
intense
concentration
these
are
much
deeper
waters
than
had
though
he
sank
his
head
upon
his
hands
while
the
inspector
smiled
at
the
effect
which
his
case
had
upon
the
famous
london
specialist
your
last
remark
said
holmes
presently
as
to
the
possibility
of
there
being
an
understanding
between
the
burglar
and
the
servant
and
this
being
note
of
appointment
from
one
to
the
other
is
an
ingenious
and
not
entirely
impossible
supposition
but
this
writing
opens
up—
he
sank
his
head
into
his
hands
again
and
remained
for
some
minutes
in
the
deepest
thought
when
he
raised
his
face
again
was
surprised
to
see
that
his
cheek
was
tinged
with
colour
and
his
eyes
as
bright
as
before
his
illness
he
sprang
to
his
feet
with
all
his
old
energy
ll
tell
you
what
said
he
should
like
to
have
quiet
little
glance
into
the
details
of
this
case
there
is
something
in
it
which
fascinates
me
extremely
if
you
will
permit
me
colonel
will
leave
my
friend
watson
and
you
and
will
step
round
with
the
inspector
to
test
the
truth
of
one
or
two
little
fancies
of
mine
will
be
with
you
again
in
half
an
hour

an
hour
and
half
had
elapsed
before
the
inspector
returned
alone
mr
holmes
is
walking
up
and
down
in
the
field
outside
said
he
wants
us
all
four
to
go
up
to
the
house
together
to
mr
cunningham
yes
sir
what
for
the
inspector
shrugged
his
shoulders
don
quite
know
sir
between
ourselves
think
mr
holmes
had
not
quite
got
over
his
illness
yet
he
been
behaving
very
queerly
and
he
is
very
much
excited
don
think
you
need
alarm
yourself
said
have
usually
found
that
there
was
method
in
his
madness
some
folks
might
say
there
was
madness
in
his
method
muttered
the
inspector
but
he
all
on
fire
to
start
colonel
so
we
had
best
go
out
if
you
are
ready
we
found
holmes
pacing
up
and
down
in
the
field
his
chin
sunk
upon
his
breast
and
his
hands
thrust
into
his
trousers
pockets
the
matter
grows
in
interest
said
he
watson
your
country
trip
has
been
distinct
success
have
had
charming
morning
you
have
been
up
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
understand
said
the
colonel
yes
the
inspector
and
have
made
quite
little
reconnaissance
together
any
success
well
we
have
seen
some
very
interesting
things
ll
tell
you
what
we
did
as
we
walk
first
of
all
we
saw
the
body
of
this
unfortunate
man
he
certainly
died
from
revolved
wound
as
reported
had
you
doubted
it
then
oh
it
is
as
well
to
test
everything
our
inspection
was
not
wasted
we
then
had
an
interview
with
mr
cunningham
and
his
son
who
were
able
to
point
out
the
exact
spot
where
the
murderer
had
broken
through
the
garden
hedge
in
his
flight
that
was
of
great
interest
naturally
then
we
had
look
at
this
poor
fellow
mother
we
could
get
no
information
from
her
however
as
she
is
very
old
and
feeble
and
what
is
the
result
of
your
investigations
the
conviction
that
the
crime
is
very
peculiar
one
perhaps
our
visit
now
may
do
something
to
make
it
less
obscure
think
that
we
are
both
agreed
inspector
that
the
fragment
of
paper
in
the
dead
man
hand
bearing
as
it
does
the
very
hour
of
his
death
written
upon
it
is
of
extreme
importance
it
should
give
clue
mr
holmes
it
does
give
clue
whoever
wrote
that
note
was
the
man
who
brought
william
kirwan
out
of
his
bed
at
that
hour
but
where
is
the
rest
of
that
sheet
of
paper
examined
the
ground
carefully
in
the
hope
of
finding
it
said
the
inspector
it
was
torn
out
of
the
dead
man
hand
why
was
some
one
so
anxious
to
get
possession
of
it
because
it
incriminated
him
and
what
would
he
do
with
it
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
most
likely
never
noticing
that
corner
of
it
had
been
left
in
the
grip
of
the
corpse
if
we
could
get
the
rest
of
that
sheet
it
is
obvious
that
we
should
have
gone
long
way
towards
solving
the
mystery
yes
but
how
can
we
get
at
the
criminal
pocket
before
we
catch
the
criminal
well
it
was
worth
thinking
over
then
there
is
another
obvious
point
the
note
was
sent
to
william
the
man
who
wrote
it
could
not
have
taken
it
otherwise
of
course
he
might
have
delivered
his
own
message
by
word
of
mouth
who
brought
the
note
then
or
did
it
come
through
the
post
have
made
inquiries
said
the
inspector
william
received
letter
by
the
afternoon
post
yesterday
the
envelope
was
destroyed
by
him
excellent
cried
holmes
clapping
the
inspector
on
the
back
you
ve
seen
the
postman
it
is
pleasure
to
work
with
you
well
here
is
the
lodge
and
if
you
will
come
up
colonel
will
show
you
the
scene
of
the
crime
we
passed
the
pretty
cottage
where
the
murdered
man
had
lived
and
walked
up
an
oak
lined
avenue
to
the
fine
old
queen
anne
house
which
bears
the
date
of
malplaquet
upon
the
lintel
of
the
door
holmes
and
the
inspector
led
us
round
it
until
we
came
to
the
side
gate
which
is
separated
by
stretch
of
garden
from
the
hedge
which
lines
the
road
constable
was
standing
at
the
kitchen
door
throw
the
door
open
officer
said
holmes
now
it
was
on
those
stairs
that
young
mr
cunningham
stood
and
saw
the
two
men
struggling
just
where
we
are
old
mr
cunningham
was
at
that
window
the
second
on
the
left
and
he
saw
the
fellow
get
away
just
to
the
left
of
that
bush
then
mr
alec
ran
out
and
knelt
beside
the
wounded
man
the
ground
is
very
hard
you
see
and
there
are
no
marks
to
guide
us
as
he
spoke
two
men
came
down
the
garden
path
from
round
the
angle
of
the
house
the
one
was
an
elderly
man
with
strong
deep
lined
heavy
eyed
face
the
other
dashing
young
fellow
whose
bright
smiling
expression
and
showy
dress
were
in
strange
contract
with
the
business
which
had
brought
us
there
still
at
it
then
said
he
to
holmes
thought
you
londoners
were
never
at
fault
you
don
seem
to
be
so
very
quick
after
all
ah
you
must
give
us
little
time
said
holmes
good
humoredly
you
ll
want
it
said
young
alec
cunningham
why
don
see
that
we
have
any
clue
at
all
there
only
one
answered
the
inspector
we
thought
that
if
we
could
only
find
good
heavens
mr
holmes
what
is
the
matter
my
poor
friend
face
had
suddenly
assumed
the
most
dreadful
expression
his
eyes
rolled
upwards
his
features
writhed
in
agony
and
with
suppressed
groan
he
dropped
on
his
face
upon
the
ground
horrified
at
the
suddenness
and
severity
of
the
attack
we
carried
him
into
the
kitchen
where
he
lay
back
in
large
chair
and
breathed
heavily
for
some
minutes
finally
with
shamefaced
apology
for
his
weakness
he
rose
once
more
watson
would
tell
you
that
have
only
just
recovered
from
severe
illness
he
explained
am
liable
to
these
sudden
nervous
attacks
shall
send
you
home
in
my
trap
asked
old
cunningham
well
since
am
here
there
is
one
point
on
which
should
like
to
feel
sure
we
can
very
easily
verify
it
what
was
it
well
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
just
possible
that
the
arrival
of
this
poor
fellow
william
was
not
before
but
after
the
entrance
of
the
burglary
into
the
house
you
appear
to
take
it
for
granted
that
although
the
door
was
forced
the
robber
never
got
in
fancy
that
is
quite
obvious
said
mr
cunningham
gravely
why
my
son
alec
had
not
yet
gone
to
bed
and
he
would
certainly
have
heard
any
one
moving
about
where
was
he
sitting
was
smoking
in
my
dressing
room
which
window
is
that
the
last
on
the
left
next
my
father
both
of
your
lamps
were
lit
of
course
undoubtedly
there
are
some
very
singular
points
here
said
holmes
smiling
is
it
not
extraordinary
that
burglary
and
burglar
who
had
some
previous
experience
should
deliberately
break
into
house
at
time
when
he
could
see
from
the
lights
that
two
of
the
family
were
still
afoot
he
must
have
been
cool
hand
well
of
course
if
the
case
were
not
an
odd
one
we
should
not
have
been
driven
to
ask
you
for
an
explanation
said
young
mr
alec
but
as
to
your
ideas
that
the
man
had
robbed
the
house
before
william
tackled
him
think
it
most
absurd
notion
wouldn
we
have
found
the
place
disarranged
and
missed
the
things
which
he
had
taken
it
depends
on
what
the
things
were
said
holmes
you
must
remember
that
we
are
dealing
with
burglar
who
is
very
peculiar
fellow
and
who
appears
to
work
on
lines
of
his
own
look
for
example
at
the
queer
lot
of
things
which
he
took
from
acton
what
was
it
ball
of
string
letter
weight
and
don
know
what
other
odds
and
ends
well
we
are
quite
in
your
hands
mr
holmes
said
old
cunningham
anything
which
you
or
the
inspector
may
suggest
will
most
certainly
be
done
in
the
first
place
said
holmes
should
like
you
to
offer
reward
coming
from
yourself
for
the
officials
may
take
little
time
before
they
would
agree
upon
the
sum
and
these
things
cannot
be
done
too
promptly
have
jotted
down
the
form
here
if
you
would
not
mind
signing
it
fifty
pound
was
quite
enough
thought
would
willingly
give
five
hundred
said
the
taking
the
slip
of
paper
and
the
pencil
which
holmes
handed
to
him
this
is
not
quite
correct
however
he
added
glancing
over
the
document
wrote
it
rather
hurriedly
you
see
you
begin
whereas
at
about
quarter
to
one
on
tuesday
morning
an
attempt
was
made
and
so
on
it
was
at
quarter
to
twelve
as
matter
of
fact
was
pained
at
the
mistake
for
knew
how
keenly
holmes
would
feel
any
slip
of
the
kind
it
was
his
specialty
to
be
accurate
as
to
fact
but
his
recent
illness
had
shaken
him
and
this
one
little
incident
was
enough
to
show
me
that
he
was
still
far
from
being
himself
he
was
obviously
embarrassed
for
an
instant
while
the
inspector
raised
his
eyebrows
and
alec
cunningham
burst
into
laugh
the
old
gentleman
corrected
the
mistake
however
and
handed
the
paper
back
to
holmes

get
it
printed
as
soon
as
possible
he
said
think
your
idea
is
an
excellent
one
holmes
put
the
slip
of
paper
carefully
away
into
his
pocket
book
and
now
said
he
it
really
would
be
good
thing
that
we
should
all
go
over
the
house
together
and
make
certain
that
this
rather
erratic
burglar
did
not
after
all
carry
anything
away
with
him
before
entering
holmes
made
an
examination
of
the
door
which
had
been
forced
it
was
evident
that
chisel
or
strong
knife
had
been
thrust
in
and
the
lock
forced
back
with
it
we
could
see
the
marks
in
the
wood
where
it
had
been
pushed
in
you
don
use
bars
then
he
asked
we
have
never
found
it
necessary
you
don
keep
dog
yes
but
he
is
chained
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
when
do
the
servants
go
to
bed
about
ten
understand
that
william
was
usually
in
bed
also
at
that
hour
yes
it
is
singular
that
on
this
particular
night
he
should
have
been
up
now
should
be
very
glad
if
you
would
have
the
kindness
to
show
us
over
the
house
mr
cunningham
stone
flagged
passage
with
the
kitchens
branching
away
from
it
led
by
wooden
staircase
directly
to
the
first
floor
of
the
house
it
came
out
upon
the
landing
opposite
to
second
more
ornamental
stair
which
came
up
from
the
front
hall
out
of
this
landing
opened
the
drawing
room
and
several
bedrooms
including
those
of
mr
cunningham
and
his
son
holmes
walked
slowly
taking
keen
note
of
the
architecture
of
the
house
could
tell
from
his
expression
that
he
was
on
hot
scent
and
yet
could
not
in
the
least
imagine
in
what
direction
his
inferences
were
leading
him
my
good
sir
said
mr
cunningham
with
some
impatience
this
is
surely
very
unnecessary
that
is
my
room
at
the
end
of
the
stairs
and
my
son
is
the
one
beyond
it
leave
it
to
your
judgment
whether
it
was
possible
for
the
thief
to
have
come
up
here
without
disturbing
us
you
must
try
round
and
get
on
fresh
scent
fancy
said
the
son
with
rather
malicious
smile
still
must
ask
you
to
humor
me
little
further
should
like
for
example
to
see
how
far
the
windows
of
the
bedrooms
command
the
front
this
understand
is
your
son
room
he
pushed
open
the
door—
and
that
presume
is
the
dressing
room
in
which
he
sat
smoking
when
the
alarm
was
given
where
does
the
window
of
that
look
out
to
he
stepped
across
the
bedroom
pushed
open
the
door
and
glanced
round
the
other
chamber
hope
that
you
are
satisfied
now
said
mr
cunningham
tartly
thank
you
think
have
seen
all
that
wished
then
if
it
is
really
necessary
we
can
go
into
my
room
if
it
is
not
too
much
trouble
the
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
led
the
way
into
his
own
chamber
which
was
plainly
furnished
and
commonplace
room
as
we
moved
across
it
in
the
direction
of
the
window
holmes
fell
back
until
he
and
were
the
last
of
the
group
near
the
foot
of
the
bed
stood
dish
of
oranges
and
carafe
of
water
as
we
passed
it
holmes
to
my
unutterable
astonishment
leaned
over
in
front
of
me
and
deliberately
knocked
the
whole
thing
over
the
glass
smashed
into
thousand
pieces
and
the
fruit
rolled
about
into
every
corner
of
the
room
you
ve
done
it
now
watson
said
he
coolly
pretty
mess
you
ve
made
of
the
carpet
stooped
in
some
confusion
and
began
to
pick
up
the
fruit
understanding
for
some
reason
my
companion
desired
me
to
take
the
blame
upon
myself
the
others
did
the
same
and
set
the
table
on
its
legs
again
hullo
cried
the
inspector
where
he
got
to
holmes
had
disappeared
wait
here
an
instant
said
young
alec
cunningham
the
fellow
is
off
his
head
in
my
opinion
come
with
me
father
and
see
where
he
has
got
to
they
rushed
out
of
the
room
leaving
the
inspector
the
colonel
and
me
staring
at
each
other
pon
my
word
am
inclined
to
agree
with
master
alec
said
the
official
it
may
be
the
effect
of
this
illness
but
it
seems
to
me
that—
his
words
were
cut
short
by
sudden
scream
of
help
murder
with
thrill
recognized
the
voice
of
that
of
my
friend
rushed
madly
from
the
room
on
to
the
landing
the
cries
which
had
sunk
down
into
hoarse
inarticulate
shouting
came
from
the
room
which
we
had
first
visited
dashed
in
and
on
into
the
dressing
room
beyond
the
two
cunninghams
were
bending
over
the
prostrate
figure
of
sherlock
holmes
the
younger
clutching
his
throat
with
both
hands
while
the
elder
seemed
to
be
twisting
one
of
his
wrists
in
an
instant
the
three
of
us
had
torn
them
away
from
him
and
holmes
staggered
to
his
feet
very
pale
and
evidently
greatly
exhausted
arrest
these
men
inspector
he
gasped
on
what
charge
that
of
murdering
their
coachman
william
kirwan
the
inspector
stared
about
him
in
bewilderment
oh
come
now
mr
holmes
said
he
at
last
sure
you
don
really
mean
to—
tut
man
look
at
their
faces
cried
holmes
curtly
never
certainly
have
seen
plainer
confession
of
guilt
upon
human
countenances
the
older
man
seemed
numbed
and
dazed
with
heavy
sullen
expression
upon
his
strongly
marked
face
the
son
on
the
other
hand
had
dropped
all
that
jaunty
dashing
style
which
had
characterized
him
and
the
ferocity
of
dangerous
wild
beast
gleamed
in
his
dark
eyes
and
distorted
his
handsome
features
the
inspector
said
nothing
but
stepping
to
the
door
he
blew
his
whistle
two
of
his
constables
came
at
the
call
have
no
alternative
mr
cunningham
said
he
trust
that
this
may
all
prove
to
be
an
absurd
mistake
but
you
can
see
that
ah
would
you
drop
it
he
struck
out
with
his
hand
and
revolver
which
the
younger
man
was
in
the
act
of
cocking
clattered
down
upon
the
floor
keep
that
said
holmes
quietly
putting
his
foot
upon
it
you
will
find
it
useful
at
the
trial
but
this
is
what
we
really
wanted
he
held
up
little
crumpled
piece
of
paper
the
remainder
of
the
sheet
cried
the
inspector
precisely
and
where
was
it
where
was
sure
it
must
be
ll
make
the
whole
matter
clear
to
you
presently
think
colonel
that
you
and
watson
might
return
now
and
will
be
with
you
again
in
an
hour
at
the
furthest
the
inspector
and
must
have
word
with
the
prisoners
but
you
will
certainly
see
me
back
at
luncheon
time
sherlock
holmes
was
as
good
as
his
word
for
about
one
clock
he
rejoined
us
in
the
colonel
smoking
room
he
was
accompanied
by
little
elderly
gentleman
who
was
introduced
to
me
as
the
mr
acton
whose
house
had
been
the
scene
of
the
original
burglary
wished
mr
acton
to
be
present
while
demonstrated
this
small
matter
to
you
said
holmes
for
it
is
natural
that
he
should
take
keen
interest
in
the
details
am
afraid
my
dear
colonel
that
you
must
regret
the
hour
that
you
took
in
such
stormy
petrel
as
am
on
the
contrary
answered
the
colonel
warmly
consider
it
the
greatest
privilege
to
have
been
permitted
to
study
your
methods
of
working
confess
that
they
quite
surpass
my
expectations
and
that
am
utterly
unable
to
account
for
you
result
have
not
yet
seen
the
vestige
of
clue
am
afraid
that
my
explanation
may
disillusion
you
but
it
has
always
been
my
habit
to
hide
none
of
my
methods
either
from
my
friend
watson
or
from
any
one
who
might
take
an
intelligent
interest
in
them
but
first
as
am
rather
shaken
by
the
knocking
about
which
had
in
the
dressing
room
think
that
shall
help
myself
to
dash
of
your
brandy
colonel
my
strength
had
been
rather
tried
of
late
trust
that
you
had
no
more
of
those
nervous
attacks
sherlock
holmes
laughed
heartily
we
will
come
to
that
in
its
turn
said
he
will
lay
an
account
of
the
case
before
you
in
its
due
order
showing
you
the
various
points
which
guided
me
in
my
decision
pray
interrupt
me
if
there
is
any
inference
which
is
not
perfectly
clear
to
you
it
is
of
the
highest
importance
in
the
art
of
detection
to
be
able
to
recognize
out
of
number
of
facts
which
are
incidental
and
which
vital
otherwise
your
energy
and
attention
must
be
dissipated
instead
of
being
concentrated
now
in
this
case
there
was
not
the
slightest
doubt
in
my
mind
from
the
first
that
the
key
of
the
whole
matter
must
be
looked
for
in
the
scrap
of
paper
in
the
dead
man
hand
before
going
into
this
would
draw
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
if
alec
cunningham
narrative
was
correct
and
if
the
assailant
after
shooting
william
kirwan
had
instantly
fled
then
it
obviously
could
not
be
he
who
tore
the
paper
from
the
dead
man
hand
but
if
it
was
not
he
it
must
have
been
alec
cunningham
himself
for
by
the
time
that
the
old
man
had
descended
several
servants
were
upon
the
scene
the
point
is
simple
one
but
the
inspector
had
overlooked
it
because
he
had
started
with
the
supposition
that
these
county
magnates
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
now
make
pint
of
never
having
any
prejudices
and
of
following
docilely
wherever
fact
may
lead
me
and
so
in
the
very
first
stage
of
the
investigation
found
myself
looking
little
askance
at
the
part
which
had
been
played
by
mr
alec
cunningham

and
now
made
very
careful
examination
of
the
corner
of
paper
which
the
inspector
had
submitted
to
us
it
was
at
once
clear
to
me
that
it
formed
part
of
very
remarkable
document
here
it
is
do
you
not
now
observed
something
very
suggestive
about
it
has
very
irregular
look
said
the
colonel
my
dear
sir
cried
holmes
there
cannot
be
the
least
doubt
in
the
world
that
it
has
been
written
by
two
persons
doing
alternate
words
when
draw
your
attention
to
the
strong
of
at
and
to
and
ask
you
to
compare
them
with
the
weak
ones
of
quarter
and
twelve
you
will
instantly
recognize
the
fact
very
brief
analysis
of
these
four
words
would
enable
you
to
say
with
the
utmost
confidence
that
the
learn
and
the
maybe
are
written
in
the
stronger
hand
and
the
what
in
the
weaker
by
jove
it
as
clear
as
day
cried
the
colonel
why
on
earth
should
two
men
write
letter
in
such
fashion
obviously
the
business
was
bad
one
and
one
of
the
men
who
distrusted
the
other
was
determined
that
whatever
was
done
each
should
have
an
equal
hand
in
it
now
of
the
two
men
it
is
clear
that
the
one
who
wrote
the
at
and
to
was
the
ringleader
how
do
you
get
at
that
we
might
deduce
it
from
the
mere
character
of
the
one
hand
as
compared
with
the
other
but
we
have
more
assured
reasons
than
that
for
supposing
it
if
you
examine
this
scrap
with
attention
you
will
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
man
with
the
stronger
hand
wrote
all
his
words
first
leaving
blanks
for
the
other
to
fill
up
these
blanks
were
not
always
sufficient
and
you
can
see
that
the
second
man
had
squeeze
to
fit
his
quarter
in
between
the
at
and
the
to
showing
that
the
latter
were
already
written
the
man
who
wrote
all
his
words
first
in
undoubtedly
the
man
who
planned
the
affair
excellent
cried
mr
acton
but
very
superficial
said
holmes
we
come
now
however
to
point
which
is
of
importance
you
may
not
be
aware
that
the
deduction
of
man
age
from
his
writing
is
one
which
has
brought
to
considerable
accuracy
by
experts
in
normal
cases
one
can
place
man
in
his
true
decade
with
tolerable
confidence
say
normal
cases
because
ill
health
and
physical
weakness
reproduce
the
signs
of
old
age
even
when
the
invalid
is
youth
in
this
case
looking
at
the
bold
strong
hand
of
the
one
and
the
rather
broken
backed
appearance
of
the
other
which
still
retains
its
legibility
although
the
have
begun
to
lose
their
crossing
we
can
say
that
the
one
was
young
man
and
the
other
was
advanced
in
years
without
being
positively
decrepit
excellent
cried
mr
acton
again
there
is
further
point
however
which
is
subtler
and
of
greater
interest
there
is
something
in
common
between
these
hands
they
belong
to
men
who
are
blood
relatives
it
may
be
most
obvious
to
you
in
the
greek
but
to
me
there
are
many
small
points
which
indicate
the
same
thing
have
no
doubt
at
all
that
family
mannerism
can
be
traced
in
these
two
specimens
of
writing
am
only
of
course
giving
you
the
leading
results
now
of
my
examination
of
the
paper
there
were
twenty
three
other
deductions
which
would
be
of
more
interest
to
experts
than
to
you
they
all
tend
to
deepen
the
impression
upon
my
mind
that
the
cunninghams
father
and
son
had
written
this
letter
having
got
so
far
my
next
step
was
of
course
to
examine
into
the
details
of
the
crime
and
to
see
how
far
they
would
help
us
went
up
to
the
house
with
the
inspector
and
saw
all
that
was
to
be
seen
the
wound
upon
the
dead
man
was
as
was
able
to
determine
with
absolute
confidence
fired
from
revolver
at
the
distance
of
something
over
four
yards
there
was
no
powder
blackening
on
the
clothes
evidently
therefore
alec
cunningham
had
lied
when
he
said
that
the
two
men
were
struggling
when
the
shot
was
fired
again
both
father
and
son
agreed
as
to
the
place
where
the
man
escaped
into
the
road
at
that
point
however
as
it
happens
there
is
broadish
ditch
moist
at
the
bottom
as
there
were
no
indications
of
bootmarks
about
this
ditch
was
absolutely
sure
not
only
that
the
cunninghams
had
again
lied
but
that
there
had
never
been
any
unknown
man
upon
the
scene
at
all
and
now
have
to
consider
the
motive
of
this
singular
crime
to
get
at
this
endeavored
first
of
all
to
solve
the
reason
of
the
original
burglary
at
mr
acton
understood
from
something
which
the
colonel
told
us
that
lawsuit
had
been
going
on
between
you
mr
acton
and
the
cunninghams
of
course
it
instantly
occurred
to
me
that
they
had
broken
into
your
library
with
the
intention
of
getting
at
some
document
which
might
be
of
importance
in
the
case
precisely
so
said
mr
acton
there
can
be
no
possible
doubt
as
to
their
intentions
have
the
clearest
claim
upon
half
of
their
present
estate
and
if
they
could
have
found
single
paper
which
fortunately
was
in
the
strong
box
of
my
solicitors
they
would
undoubtedly
have
crippled
our
case
there
you
are
said
holmes
smiling
it
was
dangerous
reckless
attempt
in
which
seem
to
trace
the
influence
of
young
alec
having
found
nothing
they
tried
to
divert
suspicion
by
making
it
appear
to
be
an
ordinary
burglary
to
which
end
they
carried
off
whatever
they
could
lay
their
hands
upon
that
is
all
clear
enough
but
there
was
much
that
was
still
obscure
what
wanted
above
all
was
to
get
the
missing
part
of
that
note
was
certain
that
alec
had
torn
it
out
of
the
dead
man
hand
and
almost
certain
that
he
must
have
thrust
it
into
the
pocket
of
his
dressing
gown
where
else
could
he
have
put
it
the
only
question
was
whether
it
was
still
there
it
was
worth
an
effort
to
find
out
and
for
that
object
we
all
went
up
to
the
house
the
cunninghams
joined
us
as
you
doubtless
remember
outside
the
kitchen
door
it
was
of
course
of
the
very
first
importance
that
they
should
not
be
reminded
of
the
existence
of
this
paper
otherwise
they
would
naturally
destroy
it
without
delay
the
inspector
was
about
to
tell
them
the
importance
which
we
attached
to
it
when
by
the
luckiest
chance
in
the
world
tumbled
down
in
sort
of
fit
and
so
changed
the
conversation
good
heavens
cried
the
colonel
laughing
do
you
mean
to
say
all
our
sympathy
was
wasted
and
your
fit
an
imposture
speaking
professionally
it
was
admirably
done
cried
looking
in
amazement
at
this
man
who
was
forever
confounding
me
with
some
new
phase
of
his
astuteness
it
is
an
art
which
is
often
useful
said
he
when
recovered
managed
by
device
which
had
perhaps
some
little
merit
of
ingenuity
to
get
old
cunningham
to
write
the
word
twelve
so
that
might
compare
it
with
the
twelve
upon
the
paper
oh
what
an
ass
have
been
exclaimed
could
see
that
you
were
commiserating
me
over
my
weakness
said
holmes
laughing
was
sorry
to
cause
you
the
sympathetic
pain
which
know
that
you
felt
we
then
went
upstairs
together
and
having
entered
the
room
and
seen
the
dressing
gown
hanging
up
behind
the
door
contrived
by
upsetting
table
to
engage
their
attention
for
the
moment
and
slipped
back
to
examine
the
pockets
had
hardly
got
the
paper
however
which
was
as
had
expected
in
one
of
them
when
the
two
cunninghams
were
on
me
and
would
verily
believe
have
murdered
me
then
and
there
but
for
your
prompt
and
friendly
aid
as
it
is
feel
that
young
man
grip
on
my
throat
now
and
the
father
has
twisted
my
wrist
round
in
the
effort
to
get
the
paper
out
of
my
hand
they
saw
that
must
know
all
about
it
you
see
and
the
sudden
change
from
absolute
security
to
complete
despair
made
them
perfectly
desperate
had
little
talk
with
old
cunningham
afterwards
as
to
the
motive
of
the
crime
he
was
tractable
enough
though
his
son
was
perfect
demon
ready
to
blow
out
his
own
or
anybody
else
brains
if
he
could
have
got
to
his
revolver
when
cunningham
saw
that
the
case
against
him
was
so
strong
he
lost
all
heart
and
made
clean
breast
of
everything
it
seems
that
william
had
secretly
followed
his
two
masters
on
the
night
when
they
made
their
raid
upon
mr
acton
and
having
thus
got
them
into
his
power
proceeded
under
threats
of
exposure
to
levy
black
mail
upon
them
mr
alec
however
was
dangerous
man
to
play
games
of
that
sort
with
it
was
stroke
of
positive
genius
on
his
part
to
see
in
the
burglary
scare
which
was
convulsing
the
country
side
an
opportunity
of
plausibly
getting
rid
of
the
man
whom
he
feared
william
was
decoyed
up
and
shot
and
had
they
only
got
the
whole
of
the
note
and
paid
little
more
attention
to
detail
in
the
accessories
it
is
very
possible
that
suspicion
might
never
have
been
aroused
and
the
note
asked
sherlock
holmes
placed
the
subjoined
paper
before
us
if
you
will
only
come
around
to
the
east
gate
you
will
very
much
surprise
you
and
be
of
the
greatest
service
to
you

also
to

anyone
upon
the
matter
it
is
very
much
the
sort
of
thing
that
expected
said
he
of
course
we
do
not
yet
know
what
the
relations
may
have
been
between
alec
cunningham
william
kirwan
and
annie
morrison
the
results
shows
that
the
trap
was
skillfully
baited
am
sure
that
you
cannot
fail
to
be
delighted
with
the
traces
of
heredity
shown
in
the
and
in
the
tails
of
the
absence
of
the
dots

also
most
characteristic
watson

the
crooked
man
one
summer
night
few
months
after
my
marriage
was
seated
by
my
own
hearth
smoking
last
pipe
and
nodding
over
novel
for
my
day
work
had
been
an
exhausting
one
my
wife
had
already
gone
upstairs
and
the
sound
of
the
locking
of
the
hall
door
some
time
before
told
me
that
the
servants
had
also
retired
had
risen
from
my
seat
and
was
knocking
out
the
ashes
of
my
pipe
when
suddenly
heard
the
clang
of
the
bell
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
quarter
to
twelve
this
could
not
be
visitor
at
so
late
an
hour
patient
evidently
and
possibly
an
all
night
sitting
with
wry
face
went
out
into
the
hall
and
opened
the
door
to
my
astonishment
it
was
sherlock
holmes
who
stood
upon
my
step
ah
watson
said
he
hoped
that
might
not
be
too
late
to
catch
you
my
dear
fellow
pray
come
in
you
look
surprised
and
no
wonder
relieved
too
fancy
hum
you
still
smoke
the
arcadia
mixture
of
your
bachelor
days
then
there
no
mistaking
that
fluffy
ash
upon
your
coat
it
easy
to
tell
that
you
have
been
accustomed
to
wear
uniform
watson
you
ll
never
pass
as
pure
bred
civilian
as
long
as
you
keep
that
habit
of
carrying
your
handkerchief
in
your
sleeve
could
you
put
me
up
tonight
with
pleasure
you
told
me
that
you
had
bachelor
quarters
for
one
and
see
that
you
have
no
gentleman
visitor
at
present
your
hat
stand
proclaims
as
much
shall
be
delighted
if
you
will
stay
thank
you
ll
fill
the
vacant
peg
then
sorry
to
see
that
you
ve
had
the
british
workman
in
the
house
he
token
of
evil
not
the
drains
hope
no
the
gas
ah
he
has
left
two
nail
marks
from
his
boot
upon
your
linoleum
just
where
the
light
strikes
it
no
thank
you
had
some
supper
at
waterloo
but
ll
smoke
pipe
with
you
with
pleasure
handed
him
my
pouch
and
he
seated
himself
opposite
to
me
and
smoked
for
some
time
in
silence
was
well
aware
that
nothing
but
business
of
importance
would
have
brought
him
to
me
at
such
an
hour
so
waited
patiently
until
he
should
come
round
to
it
see
that
you
are
professionally
rather
busy
just
now
said
he
glancing
very
keenly
across
at
me
yes
ve
had
busy
day
answered
it
may
seem
very
foolish
in
your
eyes
added
but
really
don
know
how
you
deduced
it
holmes
chuckled
to
himself
have
the
advantage
of
knowing
your
habits
my
dear
watson
said
he
when
your
round
is
short
one
you
walk
and
when
it
is
long
one
you
use
hansom
as
perceive
that
your
boots
although
used
are
by
no
means
dirty
cannot
doubt
that
you
are
at
present
busy
enough
to
justify
the
hansom
excellent
cried
elementary
said
he
it
is
one
of
those
instances
where
the
reasoner
can
produce
an
effect
which
seems
remarkable
to
his
neighbor
because
the
latter
has
missed
the
one
little
point
which
is
the
basis
of
the
deduction
the
same
may
be
said
my
dear
fellow
for
the
effect
of
some
of
these
little
sketches
of
your
which
is
entirely
meretricious
depending
as
it
does
upon
your
retaining
in
your
own
hands
some
factors
in
the
problem
which
are
never
imparted
to
the
reader
now
at
present
am
in
the
position
of
these
same
readers
for
hold
in
this
hand
several
threads
of
one
of
the
strangest
cases
which
ever
perplexed
man
brain
and
yet
lack
the
one
or
two
which
are
needful
to
complete
my
theory
but
ll
have
them
watson
ll
have
them
his
eyes
kindled
and
slight
flush
sprang
into
his
thin
cheeks
for
an
instant
only
when
glanced
again
his
face
had
resumed
that
red
indian
composure
which
had
made
so
many
regard
him
as
machine
rather
than
man
the
problem
presents
features
of
interest
said
he
may
even
say
exceptional
features
of
interest
have
already
looked
into
the
matter
and
have
come
as
think
within
sight
of
my
solution
if
you
could
accompany
me
in
that
last
step
you
might
be
of
considerable
service
to
me
should
be
delighted
could
you
go
as
far
as
aldershot
to
morrow
have
no
doubt
jackson
would
take
my
practice
very
good
want
to
start
by
the
11
10
from
waterloo
that
would
give
me
time
then
if
you
are
not
too
sleepy
will
give
you
sketch
of
what
has
happened
and
of
what
remains
to
be
done
was
sleepy
before
you
came
am
quite
wakeful
now
will
compress
the
story
as
far
as
may
be
done
without
omitting
anything
vital
to
the
case
it
is
conceivable
that
you
may
even
have
read
some
account
of
the
matter
it
is
the
supposed
murder
of
colonel
barclay
of
the
royal
munsters
at
aldershot
which
am
investigating
have
heard
nothing
of
it
has
not
excited
much
attention
yet
except
locally
the
facts
are
only
two
days
old
briefly
they
are
these
the
royal
munsters
is
as
you
know
one
of
the
most
famous
irish
regiments
in
the
british
army
it
did
wonders
both
in
the
crimea
and
the
mutiny
and
has
since
that
time
distinguished
itself
upon
every
possible
occasion
it
was
commanded
up
to
monday
night
by
james
barclay
gallant
veteran
who
started
as
full
private
was
raised
to
commissioned
rank
for
his
bravery
at
the
time
of
the
mutiny
and
so
lived
to
command
the
regiment
in
which
he
had
once
carried
musket
colonel
barclay
had
married
at
the
time
when
he
was
sergeant
and
his
wife
whose
maiden
name
was
miss
nancy
devoy
was
the
daughter
of
former
colour
sergeant
in
the
same
corps
there
was
therefore
as
can
be
imagined
some
little
social
friction
when
the
young
couple
for
they
were
still
young
found
themselves
in
their
new
surroundings
they
appear
however
to
have
quickly
adapted
themselves
and
mrs
barclay
has
always
understand
been
as
popular
with
the
ladies
of
the
regiment
as
her
husband
was
with
his
brother
officers
may
add
that
she
was
woman
of
great
beauty
and
that
even
now
when
she
has
been
married
for
upwards
of
thirty
years
she
is
still
of
striking
and
queenly
appearance
colonel
barclay
family
life
appears
to
have
been
uniformly
happy
one
major
murphy
to
whom
owe
most
of
my
facts
assures
me
that
he
has
never
heard
of
any
misunderstanding
between
the
pair
on
the
whole
he
thinks
that
barclay
devotion
to
his
wife
was
greater
than
his
wife
to
barclay
he
was
acutely
uneasy
if
he
were
absent
from
her
for
day
she
on
the
other
hand
though
devoted
and
faithful
was
less
obtrusively
affectionate
but
they
were
regarded
in
the
regiment
as
the
very
model
of
middle
aged
couple
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
their
mutual
relations
to
prepare
people
for
the
tragedy
which
was
to
follow
colonel
barclay
himself
seems
to
have
had
some
singular
traits
in
his
character
he
was
dashing
jovial
old
solder
in
his
usual
mood
but
there
were
occasions
on
which
he
seemed
to
show
himself
capable
of
considerable
violence
and
vindictiveness
this
side
of
his
nature
however
appears
never
to
have
been
turned
towards
his
wife
another
fact
which
had
struck
major
murphy
and
three
out
of
five
of
the
other
officers
with
whom
conversed
was
the
singular
sort
of
depression
which
came
upon
him
at
times
as
the
major
expressed
it
the
smile
had
often
been
struck
from
his
mouth
as
if
by
some
invisible
hand
when
he
has
been
joining
the
gayeties
and
chaff
of
the
mess
table
for
days
on
end
when
the
mood
was
on
him
he
has
been
sunk
in
the
deepest
gloom
this
and
certain
tinge
of
superstition
were
the
only
unusual
traits
in
his
character
which
his
brother
officers
had
observed
the
latter
peculiarity
took
the
form
of
dislike
to
being
left
alone
especially
after
dark
this
puerile
feature
in
nature
which
was
conspicuously
manly
had
often
given
rise
to
comment
and
conjecture
the
first
battalion
of
the
royal
munsters
which
is
the
old
117th
has
been
stationed
at
aldershot
for
some
years
the
married
officers
live
out
of
barracks
and
the
colonel
has
during
all
this
time
occupied
villa
called
lachine
about
half
mile
from
the
north
camp
the
house
stands
in
its
own
grounds
but
the
west
side
of
it
is
not
more
than
thirty
yards
from
the
high
road
coachman
and
two
maids
form
the
staff
of
servants
these
with
their
master
and
mistress
were
the
sole
occupants
of
lachine
for
the
barclays
had
no
children
nor
was
it
usual
for
them
to
have
resident
visitors

the
events
at
lachine
between
nine
and
ten
on
the
evening
of
last
monday
mrs
barclay
was
it
appears
member
of
the
roman
catholic
church
and
had
interested
herself
very
much
in
the
establishment
of
the
guild
of
st
george
which
was
formed
in
connection
with
the
watt
street
chapel
for
the
purpose
of
supplying
the
poor
with
cast
off
clothing
meeting
of
the
guild
had
been
held
that
evening
at
eight
and
mrs
barclay
had
hurried
over
her
dinner
in
order
to
be
present
at
it
when
leaving
the
house
she
was
heard
by
the
coachman
to
make
some
commonplace
remark
to
her
husband
and
to
assure
him
that
she
would
be
back
before
very
long
she
then
called
for
miss
morrison
young
lady
who
lives
in
the
next
villa
and
the
two
went
off
together
to
their
meeting
it
lasted
forty
minutes
and
at
quarter
past
nine
mrs
barclay
returned
home
having
left
miss
morrison
at
her
door
as
she
passed
there
is
room
which
is
used
as
morning
room
at
lachine
this
faces
the
road
and
opens
by
large
glass
folding
door
on
to
the
lawn
the
lawn
is
thirty
yards
across
and
is
only
divided
from
the
highway
by
low
wall
with
an
iron
rail
above
it
was
into
this
room
that
mrs
barclay
went
upon
her
return
the
blinds
were
not
down
for
the
room
was
seldom
used
in
the
evening
but
mrs
barclay
herself
lit
the
lamp
and
then
rang
the
bell
asking
jane
stewart
the
house
maid
to
bring
her
cup
of
tea
which
was
quite
contrary
to
her
usual
habits
the
colonel
had
been
sitting
in
the
dining
room
but
hearing
that
his
wife
had
returned
he
joined
her
in
the
morning
room
the
coachman
saw
him
cross
the
hall
and
enter
it
he
was
never
seen
again
alive
the
tea
which
had
been
ordered
was
brought
up
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
but
the
maid
as
she
approached
the
door
was
surprised
to
hear
the
voices
of
her
master
and
mistress
in
furious
altercation
she
knocked
without
receiving
any
answer
and
even
turned
the
handle
but
only
to
find
that
the
door
was
locked
upon
the
inside
naturally
enough
she
ran
down
to
tell
the
cook
and
the
two
women
with
the
coachman
came
up
into
the
hall
and
listened
to
the
dispute
which
was
still
raging
they
all
agreed
that
only
two
voices
were
to
be
heard
those
of
barclay
and
of
his
wife
barclay
remarks
were
subdued
and
abrupt
so
that
none
of
them
were
audible
to
the
listeners
the
lady
on
the
other
hand
were
most
bitter
and
when
she
raised
her
voice
could
be
plainly
heard
you
coward
she
repeated
over
and
over
again
what
can
be
done
now
what
can
be
done
now
give
me
back
my
life
will
never
so
much
as
breathe
the
same
air
with
you
again
you
coward
you
coward
those
were
scraps
of
her
conversation
ending
in
sudden
dreadful
cry
in
the
man
voice
with
crash
and
piercing
scream
from
the
woman
convinced
that
some
tragedy
had
occurred
the
coachman
rushed
to
the
door
and
strove
to
force
it
while
scream
after
scream
issued
from
within
he
was
unable
however
to
make
his
way
in
and
the
maids
were
too
distracted
with
fear
to
be
of
any
assistance
to
him
sudden
thought
struck
him
however
and
he
ran
through
the
hall
door
and
round
to
the
lawn
upon
which
the
long
french
windows
open
one
side
of
the
window
was
open
which
understand
was
quite
usual
in
the
summer
time
and
he
passed
without
difficulty
into
the
room
his
mistress
had
ceased
to
scream
and
was
stretched
insensible
upon
couch
while
with
his
feet
tilted
over
the
side
of
an
arm
chair
and
his
head
upon
the
ground
near
the
corner
of
the
fender
was
lying
the
unfortunate
soldier
stone
dead
in
pool
of
his
own
blood
naturally
the
coachman
first
thought
on
finding
that
he
could
do
nothing
for
his
master
was
to
open
the
door
but
here
an
unexpected
and
singular
difficulty
presented
itself
the
key
was
not
in
the
inner
side
of
the
door
nor
could
he
find
it
anywhere
in
the
room
he
went
out
again
therefore
through
the
window
and
having
obtained
the
help
of
policeman
and
of
medical
man
he
returned
the
lady
against
whom
naturally
the
strongest
suspicion
rested
was
removed
to
her
room
still
in
state
of
insensibility
the
colonel
body
was
then
placed
upon
the
sofa
and
careful
examination
made
of
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
the
injury
from
which
the
unfortunate
veteran
was
suffering
was
found
to
be
jagged
cut
some
two
inches
long
at
the
back
part
of
his
head
which
had
evidently
been
caused
by
violent
blow
from
blunt
weapon
nor
was
it
difficult
to
guess
what
that
weapon
may
have
been
upon
the
floor
close
to
the
body
was
lying
singular
club
of
hard
carved
wood
with
bone
handle
the
colonel
possessed
varied
collection
of
weapons
brought
from
the
different
countries
in
which
he
had
fought
and
it
is
conjectured
by
the
police
that
his
club
was
among
his
trophies
the
servants
deny
having
seen
it
before
but
among
the
numerous
curiosities
in
the
house
it
is
possible
that
it
may
have
been
overlooked
nothing
else
of
importance
was
discovered
in
the
room
by
the
police
save
the
inexplicable
fact
that
neither
upon
mrs
barclay
person
nor
upon
that
of
the
victim
nor
in
any
part
of
the
room
was
the
missing
key
to
be
found
the
door
had
eventually
to
be
opened
by
locksmith
from
aldershot
that
was
the
state
of
things
watson
when
upon
the
tuesday
morning
at
the
request
of
major
murphy
went
down
to
aldershot
to
supplement
the
efforts
of
the
police
think
that
you
will
acknowledge
that
the
problem
was
already
one
of
interest
but
my
observations
soon
made
me
realize
that
it
was
in
truth
much
more
extraordinary
than
would
at
first
sight
appear
before
examining
the
room
cross
questioned
the
servants
but
only
succeeded
in
eliciting
the
facts
which
have
already
stated
one
other
detail
of
interest
was
remembered
by
jane
stewart
the
housemaid
you
will
remember
that
on
hearing
the
sound
of
the
quarrel
she
descended
and
returned
with
the
other
servants
on
that
first
occasion
when
she
was
alone
she
says
that
the
voices
of
her
master
and
mistress
were
sunk
so
low
that
she
could
hear
hardly
anything
and
judged
by
their
tones
rather
tan
their
words
that
they
had
fallen
out
on
my
pressing
her
however
she
remembered
that
she
heard
the
word
david
uttered
twice
by
the
lady
the
point
is
of
the
utmost
importance
as
guiding
us
towards
the
reason
of
the
sudden
quarrel
the
colonel
name
you
remember
was
james
there
was
one
thing
in
the
case
which
had
made
the
deepest
impression
both
upon
the
servants
and
the
police
this
was
the
contortion
of
the
colonel
face
it
had
set
according
to
their
account
into
the
most
dreadful
expression
of
fear
and
horror
which
human
countenance
is
capable
of
assuming
more
than
one
person
fainted
at
the
mere
sight
of
him
so
terrible
was
the
effect
it
was
quite
certain
that
he
had
foreseen
his
fate
and
that
it
had
caused
him
the
utmost
horror
this
of
course
fitted
in
well
enough
with
the
police
theory
if
the
colonel
could
have
seen
his
wife
making
murderous
attack
upon
him
nor
was
the
fact
of
the
wound
being
on
the
back
of
his
head
fatal
objection
to
this
as
he
might
have
turned
to
avoid
the
blow
no
information
could
be
got
from
the
lady
herself
who
was
temporarily
insane
from
an
acute
attack
of
brain
fever
from
the
police
learned
that
miss
morrison
who
you
remember
went
out
that
evening
with
mrs
barclay
denied
having
any
knowledge
of
what
it
was
which
had
caused
the
ill
humor
in
which
her
companion
had
returned
having
gathered
these
facts
watson
smoke
several
pipes
over
them
trying
to
separate
those
which
were
crucial
from
others
which
were
merely
incidental
there
could
be
no
question
that
the
most
distinctive
and
suggestive
point
in
the
case
was
the
singular
disappearance
of
the
door
key
most
careful
search
had
failed
to
discover
it
in
the
room
therefore
it
must
have
been
taken
from
it
but
neither
the
colonel
nor
the
colonel
wife
could
have
taken
it
that
was
perfectly
clear
therefore
third
person
must
have
entered
the
room
and
that
third
person
could
only
have
come
in
through
the
window
it
seemed
to
me
that
careful
examination
of
the
room
and
the
lawn
might
possibly
reveal
some
traces
of
this
mysterious
individual
you
know
my
methods
watson
there
was
not
one
of
them
which
did
not
apply
to
the
inquiry
and
ones
from
those
which
had
expected
there
had
been
man
in
the
room
and
he
had
crossed
the
lawn
coming
from
the
road
was
able
to
obtain
five
very
clear
impressions
of
his
foot
marks
one
in
the
roadway
itself
at
the
point
where
he
had
climbed
the
low
wall
two
on
the
lawn
and
two
very
faint
ones
upon
the
stained
boards
near
the
window
where
he
had
entered
he
had
apparently
rushed
across
the
lawn
for
his
toe
marks
were
much
deeper
than
his
heels
but
it
was
not
the
man
who
surprised
me
it
was
his
companion
his
companion
holmes
pulled
large
sheet
of
tissue
paper
out
of
his
pocket
and
carefully
unfolded
it
upon
his
knee
what
do
you
make
of
that
he
asked
the
paper
was
covered
with
he
tracings
of
the
foot
marks
of
some
small
animal
it
had
five
well
marked
foot
pads
an
indication
of
long
nails
and
the
whole
print
might
be
nearly
as
large
as
dessert

it
dog
said
did
you
ever
hear
of
dog
running
up
curtain
found
distinct
traces
that
this
creature
had
done
so
monkey
then
but
it
is
not
the
print
of
monkey
what
can
it
be
then
neither
dog
nor
cat
nor
monkey
nor
any
creature
that
we
are
familiar
with
have
tried
to
reconstruct
it
from
the
measurements
here
are
four
prints
where
the
beast
has
been
standing
motionless
you
see
that
it
is
no
less
than
fifteen
inches
from
fore
foot
to
hind
add
to
that
the
length
of
neck
and
head
and
you
get
creature
not
much
less
than
two
feet
long
probably
more
if
there
is
any
tail
but
now
observe
this
other
measurement
the
animal
has
been
moving
and
we
have
the
length
of
its
stride
in
each
case
it
is
only
about
three
inches
you
have
an
indication
you
see
of
long
body
with
very
short
legs
attached
to
it
has
not
been
considerate
enough
to
leave
any
of
its
hair
behind
it
but
its
general
shape
must
be
what
have
indicated
and
it
can
run
up
curtain
and
it
is
carnivorous
how
do
you
deduce
that
because
it
ran
up
the
curtain
canary
cage
was
hanging
in
the
window
and
its
aim
seems
to
have
been
to
get
at
the
bird
then
what
was
the
beast
ah
if
could
give
it
name
it
might
go
long
way
towards
solving
the
case
on
the
whole
it
was
probably
some
creature
of
the
weasel
and
stoat
tribe
and
yet
it
is
larger
than
any
of
these
that
have
seen
but
what
had
it
to
do
with
the
crime
that
also
is
still
obscure
but
we
have
learned
good
deal
you
perceive
we
know
that
man
stood
in
the
road
looking
at
the
quarrel
between
the
barclays
the
blinds
were
up
and
the
room
lighted
we
know
also
that
he
ran
across
the
lawn
entered
the
room
accompanied
by
strange
animal
and
that
he
either
struck
the
colonel
or
as
is
equally
possible
that
the
colonel
fell
down
from
sheer
fright
at
the
sight
of
him
and
cut
his
head
on
the
corner
of
the
fender
finally
we
have
the
curious
fact
that
the
intruder
carried
away
the
key
with
him
when
he
left
you
discoveries
seem
to
have
left
the
business
more
obscure
that
it
was
before
said
quite
so
they
undoubtedly
showed
that
the
affair
was
much
deeper
than
was
at
first
conjectured
thought
the
matter
over
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
must
approach
the
case
from
another
aspect
but
really
watson
am
keeping
you
up
and
might
just
as
well
tell
you
all
this
on
our
way
to
aldershot
to
morrow
thank
you
have
gone
rather
too
far
to
stop
it
is
quite
certain
that
when
mrs
barclay
left
the
house
at
half
past
seven
she
was
on
good
terms
with
her
husband
she
was
never
as
think
have
said
ostentatiously
affectionate
but
she
was
heard
by
the
coachman
chatting
with
the
colonel
in
friendly
fashion
now
it
was
equally
certain
that
immediately
on
her
return
she
had
gone
to
the
room
in
which
she
was
least
likely
to
see
her
husband
had
flown
to
tea
as
an
agitated
woman
will
and
finally
on
his
coming
in
to
her
had
broken
into
violent
recriminations
therefore
something
had
occurred
between
seven
thirty
and
nine
clock
which
had
completely
altered
her
feelings
towards
him
but
miss
morrison
had
been
with
her
during
the
whole
of
that
hour
and
half
it
was
absolutely
certain
therefore
in
spite
of
her
denial
that
she
must
know
something
of
the
matter
my
first
conjecture
was
that
possibly
there
had
been
some
passages
between
this
young
lady
and
the
old
soldier
which
the
former
had
now
confessed
to
the
wife
that
would
account
for
the
angry
return
and
also
for
the
girl
denial
that
anything
had
occurred
nor
would
it
be
entirely
incompatible
with
most
of
the
words
overhead
but
there
was
the
reference
to
david
and
there
was
the
known
affection
of
the
colonel
for
his
wife
to
weigh
against
it
to
say
nothing
of
the
tragic
intrusion
of
this
other
man
which
might
of
course
be
entirely
disconnected
with
what
had
gone
before
it
was
not
easy
to
pick
one
steps
but
on
the
whole
was
inclined
to
dismiss
the
idea
that
there
had
been
anything
between
the
colonel
and
miss
morrison
but
more
than
ever
convinced
that
the
young
lady
held
the
clue
as
to
what
it
was
which
had
turned
mrs
barclay
to
hatred
of
her
husband
took
the
obvious
course
therefore
of
calling
upon
miss
of
explaining
to
her
that
was
perfectly
certain
that
she
held
the
facts
in
her
possession
and
of
assuring
her
that
her
friend
mrs
barclay
might
find
herself
in
the
dock
upon
capital
charge
unless
the
matter
were
cleared
up
miss
morrison
is
little
ethereal
slip
of
girl
with
timid
eyes
and
blond
hair
but
found
her
by
no
means
wanting
in
shrewdness
and
common
sense
she
sat
thinking
for
some
time
after
had
spoken
and
then
turning
to
me
with
brisk
air
of
resolution
she
broke
into
remarkable
statement
which
will
condense
for
your
benefit
promised
my
friend
that
would
say
nothing
of
the
matter
and
promise
is
promise
said
she
but
if
can
really
help
her
when
so
serious
charge
is
laid
against
her
and
when
her
own
mouth
poor
darling
is
closed
by
illness
then
think
am
absolved
from
my
promise
will
tell
you
exactly
what
happened
upon
monday
evening
we
were
returning
from
the
watt
street
mission
about
quarter
to
nine
clock
on
our
way
we
had
to
pass
through
hudson
street
which
is
very
quiet
thoroughfare
there
is
only
one
lamp
in
it
upon
the
left
hand
side
and
as
we
approached
this
lamp
saw
man
coming
towards
us
with
is
back
very
bent
and
something
like
box
slung
over
one
of
his
shoulders
he
appeared
to
be
deformed
for
he
carried
his
head
low
and
walked
with
his
knees
bent
we
were
passing
him
when
he
raised
his
face
to
look
at
us
in
the
circle
of
light
thrown
by
the
lamp
and
as
he
did
so
he
stopped
and
screamed
out
in
dreadful
voice
my
god
it
nancy
mrs
barclay
turned
as
white
as
death
and
would
have
fallen
down
had
the
dreadful
looking
creature
not
caught
hold
of
her
was
going
to
call
for
the
police
but
she
to
my
surprise
spoke
quite
civilly
to
the
fellow
thought
you
had
been
dead
this
thirty
years
henry
said
she
in
shaking
voice
so
have
said
he
and
it
was
awful
to
hear
the
tones
that
he
said
it
in
he
had
very
dark
fearsome
face
and
gleam
in
his
eyes
that
comes
back
to
me
in
my
dreams
his
hair
and
whiskers
were
shot
with
grey
and
his
face
was
all
crinkled
and
puckered
like
withered
apple
just
walk
on
little
way
dear
said
mrs
barclay
want
to
have
word
with
this
man
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
she
tried
to
speak
boldly
but
she
was
still
deadly
pale
and
could
hardly
get
her
words
out
for
the
trembling
of
her
lips
did
as
she
asked
me
and
they
talked
together
for
few
minutes
then
she
came
down
the
street
with
her
eyes
blazing
and
saw
the
crippled
wretch
standing
by
the
lamp
post
and
shaking
his
clenched
fists
in
the
air
as
if
he
were
made
with
rage
she
never
said
word
until
we
were
at
the
door
here
when
she
took
me
by
the
hand
and
begged
me
to
tell
no
one
what
had
happened
it
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
who
has
come
down
in
the
world
said
she
when
promised
her
would
say
nothing
she
kissed
me
and
have
never
seen
her
since
have
told
you
now
the
whole
truth
and
if
withheld
it
from
the
police
it
is
because
did
not
realize
then
the
danger
in
which
my
dear
friend
stood
know
that
it
can
only
be
to
her
advantage
that
everything
should
be
known
there
was
her
statement
watson
and
to
me
as
you
can
imagine
it
was
like
light
on
dark
night
everything
which
had
been
disconnected
before
began
at
once
to
assume
its
true
place
and
had
shadowy
presentiment
of
the
whole
sequence
of
events
my
next
step
obviously
was
to
find
the
man
who
had
produced
such
remarkable
impression
upon
mrs
barclay
if
he
were
still
in
aldershot
it
should
not
be
very
difficult
matter
there
are
not
such
very
great
number
of
civilians
and
deformed
man
was
sure
to
have
attracted
attention
spent
day
in
the
search
and
by
evening
this
very
evening
watson
had
run
him
down
the
man
name
is
henry
wood
and
he
lives
in
lodgings
in
this
same
street
in
which
the
ladies
met
him
he
has
only
been
five
days
in
the
place
in
the
character
of
registration
agent
had
most
interesting
gossip
with
his
landlady
the
man
is
by
trade
conjurer
and
performer
going
round
the
canteens
after
nightfall
and
giving
little
entertainment
at
each
he
carries
some
creature
about
with
him
in
that
box
about
which
the
landlady
seemed
to
be
in
considerable
trepidation
for
she
had
never
seen
an
animal
like
it
he
uses
it
in
some
of
his
tricks
according
to
her
account
so
much
the
woman
was
able
to
tell
me
and
also
that
it
was
wonder
the
man
lived
seeing
how
twisted
he
was
and
that
he
spoke
in
strange
tongue
sometimes
and
that
for
the
last
two
nights
she
had
heard
him
groaning
and
weeping
in
his
bedroom
he
was
all
right
as
far
as
money
went
but
in
his
deposit
he
had
given
her
what
looked
like
bad
florin
she
showed
it
to
me
watson
and
it
was
an
indian
rupee

so
now
my
dear
fellow
you
see
exactly
how
we
stand
and
why
it
is
want
you
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
after
the
ladies
parted
from
this
man
he
followed
them
at
distance
that
he
saw
the
quarrel
between
husband
and
wife
through
the
window
that
he
rushed
in
and
that
the
creature
which
he
carried
in
his
box
got
loose
that
is
all
very
certain
but
he
is
the
only
person
in
this
world
who
can
tell
us
exactly
what
happened
in
that
room
and
you
intend
to
ask
him
most
certainly
but
in
the
presence
of
witness
and
am
the
witness
if
you
will
be
so
good
if
he
can
clear
the
matter
up
well
and
good
if
he
refuses
we
have
no
alternative
but
to
apply
for
warrant
but
how
do
you
know
he
ll
be
there
when
we
return
you
may
be
sure
that
took
some
precautions
have
one
of
my
baker
street
boys
mounting
guard
over
him
who
would
stick
to
him
like
burr
go
where
he
might
we
shall
find
him
in
hudson
street
to
morrow
watson
and
meanwhile
should
be
the
criminal
myself
if
kept
you
out
of
bed
any
longer
it
was
midday
when
we
found
ourselves
at
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
and
under
my
companion
guidance
we
made
our
way
at
once
to
hudson
street
in
spite
of
his
capacity
for
concealing
his
emotions
could
easily
see
that
holmes
was
in
state
of
suppressed
excitement
while
was
myself
tingling
with
that
half
sporting
half
intellectual
pleasure
which
invariably
experienced
when
associated
myself
with
him
in
his
investigations
this
is
the
street
said
he
as
we
turned
into
short
thoroughfare
lined
with
plain
tow
storied
brick
houses
ah
here
is
simpson
to
report
he
in
all
right
mr
holmes
cried
small
street
arab
running
up
to
us
good
simpson
said
holmes
patting
him
on
the
head
come
along
watson
this
is
the
house
he
sent
in
his
card
with
message
that
he
had
come
on
important
business
and
moment
later
we
were
face
to
face
with
the
man
whom
we
had
come
to
see
in
spite
of
the
warm
weather
he
was
crouching
over
fire
and
the
little
room
was
like
an
oven
the
man
sat
all
twisted
and
huddled
in
his
chair
in
way
which
gave
an
indescribably
impression
of
deformity
but
the
face
which
he
turned
towards
us
though
worn
and
swarthy
must
at
some
time
have
been
remarkable
for
its
beauty
he
looked
suspiciously
at
us
now
out
of
yellow
shot
bilious
eyes
and
without
speaking
or
rising
he
waved
towards
two
chairs
mr
henry
wood
late
of
india
believe
said
holmes
affably
ve
come
over
this
little
matter
of
colonel
barclay
death
what
should
know
about
that
what
want
to
ascertain
you
know
suppose
that
unless
the
matter
is
cleared
up
mrs
barclay
who
is
an
old
friend
of
yours
will
in
all
probability
be
tried
for
murder
the
man
gave
violent
start
don
know
who
you
are
he
cried
nor
how
you
come
to
know
what
you
do
know
but
will
you
swear
that
this
is
true
that
you
tell
me
why
they
are
only
waiting
for
her
to
come
to
her
senses
to
arrest
her
my
god
are
you
in
the
police
yourself
no
what
business
is
it
of
yours
then
it
every
man
business
to
see
justice
done
you
can
take
my
word
that
she
is
innocent
then
you
are
guilty
no
am
not
who
killed
colonel
james
barclay
then
it
was
just
providence
that
killed
him
but
mind
you
this
that
if
had
knocked
his
brains
out
as
it
was
in
my
heart
to
do
he
would
have
had
no
more
than
his
due
from
my
hands
if
his
own
guilty
conscience
had
not
struck
him
down
it
is
likely
enough
that
might
have
had
his
blood
upon
my
soul
you
want
me
to
tell
the
story
well
don
know
why
shouldn
for
there
no
cause
for
me
to
be
ashamed
of
it
was
in
this
way
sir
you
see
me
now
with
my
back
like
camel
and
by
ribs
all
awry
but
there
was
time
when
corporal
henry
wood
was
the
smartest
man
in
the
117th
foot
we
were
in
india
then
in
cantonments
at
place
we
ll
call
bhurtee
barclay
who
died
the
other
day
was
sergeant
in
the
same
company
as
myself
and
the
belle
of
the
regiment
ay
and
the
finest
girl
that
ever
had
the
breath
of
life
between
her
lips
was
nancy
devoy
the
daughter
of
the
colour
sergeant
there
were
two
men
that
loved
her
and
one
that
she
loved
and
you
ll
smile
when
you
look
at
this
poor
thing
huddled
before
the
fire
and
hear
me
say
that
it
was
for
my
good
looks
that
she
loved
me
well
though
had
her
heart
her
father
was
set
upon
her
marrying
barclay
was
harum
scarum
reckless
lad
and
he
had
an
education
and
was
already
marked
for
the
sword
belt
but
the
girl
held
true
to
me
and
it
seemed
that
would
have
had
her
when
the
mutiny
broke
out
and
all
hell
was
loose
in
the
country
we
were
shut
up
in
bhurtee
the
regiment
of
us
with
half
battery
of
artillery
company
of
sikhs
and
lot
of
civilians
and
women
folk
there
were
ten
thousand
rebels
round
us
and
they
were
as
keen
as
set
of
terriers
round
rat
cage
about
the
second
week
of
it
our
water
gave
out
and
it
was
question
whether
we
could
communicate
with
general
neill
column
which
was
moving
up
country
it
was
our
only
chance
for
we
could
not
hope
to
fight
our
way
out
with
all
the
women
and
children
so
volunteered
to
go
out
and
to
warn
general
neill
of
our
danger
my
offer
was
accepted
and
talked
it
over
with
sergeant
barclay
who
was
supposed
to
know
the
ground
better
than
any
other
man
and
who
drew
up
route
by
which
might
get
through
the
rebel
lines
at
ten
clock
the
same
night
started
off
upon
my
journey
there
were
thousand
lives
to
save
but
it
was
of
only
one
that
was
thinking
when
dropped
over
the
wall
that
night
my
way
ran
down
dried
up
watercourse
which
we
hoped
would
screen
me
from
the
enemy
sentries
but
as
crept
round
the
corner
of
it
walked
right
into
six
of
them
who
were
crouching
down
in
the
dark
waiting
for
me
in
an
instant
was
stunned
with
blow
and
bound
hand
and
foot
but
the
real
blow
was
to
my
heart
and
not
to
my
head
for
as
came
to
and
listened
to
as
much
as
could
understand
of
their
talk
heard
enough
to
tell
me
that
my
comrade
the
very
man
who
had
arranged
the
way
that
was
to
take
had
betrayed
me
by
means
of
native
servant
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
well
there
no
need
for
me
to
dwell
on
that
part
of
it
you
know
now
what
james
barclay
was
capable
of
bhurtee
was
relieved
by
neill
next
day
but
the
rebels
took
me
away
with
them
in
their
retreat
and
it
was
many
long
year
before
ever
saw
white
face
again
was
tortured
and
tried
to
get
away
and
was
captured
and
tortured
again
you
can
see
for
yourselves
the
state
in
which
was
left
some
of
them
that
fled
into
nepaul
took
me
with
them
and
then
afterwards
was
up
past
darjeeling
the
hill
folk
up
there
murdered
the
rebels
who
had
me
and
became
their
slave
for
time
until
escaped
but
instead
of
going
south
had
to
go
north
until
found
myself
among
the
afghans
there
wandered
about
for
many
ayear
and
at
last
came
back
to
the
punjaub
where
lived
mostly
among
the
natives
and
picked
up
living
by
the
conjuring
tricks
that
had
learned
what
use
was
it
for
me
wretched
cripple
to
go
back
to
england
or
to
make
myself
known
to
my
old
comrades
even
my
wish
for
revenge
would
not
make
me
do
that
had
rather
that
nancy
and
my
old
pals
should
think
of
harry
wood
as
having
died
with
straight
back
than
see
him
living
and
crawling
with
stick
like
chimpanzee
they
never
doubted
that
was
dead
and
meant
that
they
never
should
heard
that
barclay
had
married
nancy
and
that
he
was
rising
rapidly
in
the
regiment
but
even
that
did
not
make
me
speak
but
when
one
gets
old
one
has
longing
for
home
for
years
ve
been
dreaming
of
the
bright
green
fields
and
the
hedges
of
england
at
last
determined
to
see
them
before
died
saved
enough
to
bring
me
across
and
then
came
here
where
the
soldiers
are
for
know
their
ways
and
how
to
amuse
them
and
so
earn
enough
to
keep
me
your
narrative
is
most
interesting
said
sherlock
holmes
have
already
heard
of
your
meeting
with
mrs
barclay
and
your
mutual
recognition
you
then
as
understand
followed
her
home
and
saw
through
the
window
an
altercation
between
her
husband
and
her
in
which
she
doubtless
cast
his
conduct
to
you
in
his
teeth
your
own
feelings
overcame
you
and
you
ran
across
the
lawn
and
broke
in
upon
them
did
sir
and
at
the
sight
of
me
he
looked
as
have
never
seen
man
look
before
and
over
he
went
with
his
head
on
the
fender
but
he
was
dead
before
he
fell
read
death
on
his
face
as
plain
as
can
read
that
text
over
the
fire
the
bare
sight
of
me
was
like
bullet
through
his
guilty
heart
and
then
nancy
fainted
and
caught
up
the
key
of
the
door
from
her
hand
intending
to
unlock
it
and
get
help
but
as
was
doing
it
seemed
to
me
better
to
leave
it
alone
and
get
away
for
the
thing
might
look
black
against
me
and
any
way
my
secret
would
be
out
if
were
taken
in
my
haste
thrust
the
key
into
my
pocket
and
dropped
my
stick
while
was
chasing
teddy
who
had
run
up
the
curtain
when
got
him
into
his
box
from
which
he
had
slipped
was
off
as
fast
as
could
run

who
teddy
asked
holmes
the
man
leaned
over
and
pulled
up
the
front
of
kind
of
hutch
in
the
corner
in
an
instant
out
there
slipped
beautiful
reddish
brown
creature
thin
and
lithe
with
the
legs
of
stoat
long
thin
nose
and
pair
of
the
finest
red
eyes
that
ever
saw
in
an
animal
head
it
mongoose
cried
well
some
call
them
that
and
some
call
them
ichneumon
said
the
man
snake
catcher
is
what
call
them
and
teddy
is
amazing
quick
on
cobras
have
one
here
without
the
fangs
and
teddy
catches
it
every
night
to
please
the
folk
in
the
canteen
any
other
point
sir
well
we
may
have
to
apply
to
you
again
if
mrs
barclay
should
prove
to
be
in
serious
trouble
in
that
case
of
course
come
forward
but
if
not
there
is
no
object
in
raking
up
this
scandal
against
dead
man
foully
as
he
has
acted
you
have
at
least
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
for
thirty
years
of
his
life
his
conscience
bitterly
reproached
him
for
this
wicked
deed
ah
there
goes
major
murphy
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
good
by
wood
want
to
learn
if
anything
has
happened
since
yesterday
we
were
in
time
to
overtake
the
major
before
he
reached
the
corner
ah
holmes
he
said
suppose
you
have
heard
that
all
this
fuss
has
come
to
nothing
what
then
the
inquest
is
just
over
the
medical
evidence
showed
conclusively
that
death
was
due
to
apoplexy
you
see
it
was
quite
simple
case
after
all
oh
remarkably
superficial
said
holmes
smiling
come
watson
don
think
we
shall
be
wanted
in
aldershot
any
more
there
one
thing
said
as
we
walked
down
to
the
station
if
the
husband
name
was
james
and
the
other
was
henry
what
was
this
talk
about
david
that
one
word
my
dear
watson
should
have
told
me
the
whole
story
had
been
the
ideal
reasoner
which
you
are
so
fond
of
depicting
it
was
evidently
term
of
reproach
of
reproach
yes
david
strayed
little
occasionally
you
know
and
on
one
occasion
in
the
same
direction
as
sergeant
james
barclay
you
remember
the
small
affair
of
uriah
and
bathsheba
my
biblical
knowledge
is
trifle
rusty
fear
but
you
will
find
the
story
in
the
first
or
second
of
samuel
viii
the
resident
patient
glancing
over
the
somewhat
incoherent
series
of
memoirs
with
which
have
endeavored
to
illustrate
few
of
the
mental
peculiarities
of
my
friend
mr
sherlock
holmes
have
been
struck
by
the
difficulty
which
have
experienced
in
picking
out
examples
which
shall
in
every
way
answer
my
purpose
for
in
those
cases
in
which
holmes
has
performed
some
tour
de
force
of
analytical
reasoning
and
has
demonstrated
the
value
of
his
peculiar
methods
of
investigation
the
facts
themselves
have
often
been
so
slight
or
so
commonplace
that
could
not
feel
justified
in
laying
them
before
the
public
on
the
other
hand
it
has
frequently
happened
that
he
has
been
concerned
in
some
research
where
the
facts
have
been
of
the
most
remarkable
and
dramatic
character
but
where
the
share
which
he
has
himself
taken
in
determining
their
causes
has
been
less
pronounced
than
as
his
biographer
could
wish
the
small
matter
which
have
chronicled
under
the
heading
of
study
in
scarlet
and
that
other
later
one
connected
with
the
loss
of
the
gloria
scott
may
serve
as
examples
of
this
scylla
and
charybdis
which
are
forever
threatening
the
historian
it
may
be
that
in
the
business
of
which
am
now
about
to
write
the
part
which
my
friend
played
is
not
sufficiently
accentuated
and
yet
the
whole
train
of
circumstances
is
so
remarkable
that
cannot
bring
myself
to
omit
it
entirely
from
this
series
it
had
been
close
rainy
day
in
october
our
blinds
were
half
drawn
and
holmes
lay
curled
upon
the
sofa
reading
and
re
reading
letter
which
he
had
received
by
the
morning
post
for
myself
my
tern
of
service
in
india
had
trained
me
to
stand
heat
better
than
cold
and
thermometer
of
90
was
no
hardship
but
the
paper
was
uninteresting
parliament
had
risen
everybody
was
out
of
town
and
yearned
for
the
glades
of
the
new
forest
or
the
shingle
of
southsea
depleted
bank
account
had
caused
me
to
postpone
my
holiday
and
as
to
my
companion
neither
the
country
nor
the
sea
presented
the
slightest
attraction
to
him
he
loved
to
lie
in
the
very
centre
of
five
millions
of
people
with
his
filaments
stretching
out
and
running
through
them
responsive
to
every
little
rumor
or
suspicion
of
unsolved
crime
appreciation
of
nature
found
no
place
among
his
many
gifts
and
his
only
change
was
when
he
turned
his
mind
from
the
evil
doer
of
the
town
to
track
down
his
brother
of
the
country
finding
that
holmes
was
too
absorbed
for
conversation
had
tossed
aside
the
barren
paper
and
leaning
back
in
my
chair
fell
into
brown
study
suddenly
my
companion
voice
broke
in
upon
my
thoughts
you
are
right
watson
said
he
it
does
seem
very
preposterous
way
of
settling
dispute
most
preposterous
exclaimed
and
then
suddenly
realizing
how
he
had
echoed
the
inmost
thought
of
my
soul
sat
up
in
my
chair
and
stared
at
him
in
blank
amazement
what
is
this
holmes
cried
this
is
beyond
anything
which
could
have
imagined
he
laughed
heartily
at
my
perplexity
you
remember
said
he
that
some
little
time
ago
when
read
you
the
passage
in
one
of
poe
sketches
in
which
close
reasoner
follows
the
unspoken
thought
of
his
companion
you
were
inclined
to
treat
the
matter
as
mere
tour
de
force
of
the
author
on
my
remarking
that
was
constantly
in
the
habit
of
doing
the
same
thing
you
expressed
incredulity
oh
no
perhaps
not
with
your
tongue
my
dear
watson
but
certainly
with
your
eyebrows
so
when
saw
you
throw
down
your
paper
and
enter
upon
train
of
thought
was
very
happy
to
have
the
opportunity
of
reading
it
off
and
eventually
of
breaking
into
it
as
proof
that
had
been
in
rapport
with
you
but
was
still
far
from
satisfied
in
the
example
which
you
read
to
me
said
the
reasoner
drew
his
conclusions
from
the
actions
of
the
man
whom
he
observed
if
remember
right
he
stumbled
over
heap
of
stones
looked
up
at
the
stars
and
so
on
but
have
been
seated
quietly
in
my
chair
and
what
clews
can
have
given
you
do
yourself
an
injustice
the
features
are
given
to
man
as
the
means
by
which
he
shall
express
his
emotions
and
yours
are
faithful
servants
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
read
my
train
of
thoughts
from
my
features
your
features
and
especially
your
eyes
perhaps
you
cannot
yourself
recall
how
your
reverie
commenced
no
cannot
then
will
tell
you
after
throwing
down
your
paper
which
was
the
action
which
drew
my
attention
to
you
sat
for
half
minute
with
vacant
expression
then
your
eyes
fixed
themselves
upon
your
newly
framed
picture
of
general
gordon
and
saw
by
the
alteration
in
your
face
that
train
of
thought
had
been
started
but
it
did
not
lead
very
far
your
eyes
turned
across
to
the
unframed
portrait
of
henry
ward
beecher
which
stands
upon
the
top
of
your
books
you
then
glanced
up
at
the
wall
and
of
course
your
meaning
was
obvious
you
were
thinking
that
if
the
portrait
were
framed
it
would
just
cover
that
bare
space
and
correspond
with
gordon
picture
over
there
you
have
followed
me
wonderfully
exclaimed
so
far
could
hardly
have
gone
astray
but
now
your
thoughts
went
back
to
beecher
and
you
looked
hard
across
as
if
you
were
studying
the
character
in
his
features
then
your
eyes
ceased
to
pucker
but
you
continued
to
look
across
and
your
face
was
thoughtful
you
were
recalling
the
incidents
of
beecher
career
was
well
aware
that
you
could
not
do
this
without
thinking
of
the
mission
which
he
undertook
on
behalf
of
the
north
at
the
time
of
the
civil
war
for
remember
you
expressing
your
passionate
indignation
at
the
way
in
which
he
was
received
by
the
more
turbulent
of
our
people
you
felt
so
strongly
about
it
that
knew
you
could
not
think
of
beecher
without
thinking
of
that
also
when
moment
later
saw
your
eyes
wander
away
from
the
picture
suspected
that
your
mind
had
now
turned
to
the
civil
war
and
when
observed
that
your
lips
set
your
eyes
sparkled
and
your
hands
clinched
was
positive
that
you
were
indeed
thinking
of
the
gallantry
which
was
shown
by
both
sides
in
that
desperate
struggle
but
then
again
your
face
grew
sadder
you
shook
your
head
you
were
dwelling
upon
the
sadness
and
horror
and
useless
waste
of
life
your
hand
stole
towards
your
own
old
wound
and
smile
quivered
on
your
lips
which
showed
me
that
the
ridiculous
side
of
this
method
of
settling
international
questions
had
forced
itself
upon
your
mind
at
this
point
agreed
with
you
that
it
was
preposterous
and
was
glad
to
find
that
all
my
deductions
had
been
correct
absolutely
said
and
now
that
you
have
explained
it
confess
that
am
as
amazed
as
before

it
was
very
superficial
my
dear
watson
assure
you
should
not
have
intruded
it
upon
your
attention
had
you
not
shown
some
incredulity
the
other
day
but
the
evening
has
brought
breeze
with
it
what
do
you
say
to
ramble
through
london
was
weary
of
our
little
sitting
room
and
gladly
acquiesced
for
three
hours
we
strolled
about
together
watching
the
ever
changing
kaleidoscope
of
life
as
it
ebbs
and
flows
through
fleet
street
and
the
strand
his
characteristic
talk
with
its
keen
observance
of
detail
and
subtle
power
of
inference
held
me
amused
and
enthralled
it
was
ten
clock
before
we
reached
baker
street
again
brougham
was
waiting
at
our
door
hum
doctor
general
practitioner
perceive
said
holmes
not
been
long
in
practice
but
has
had
good
deal
to
do
come
to
consult
us
fancy
lucky
we
came
back
was
sufficiently
conversant
with
holmes
methods
to
be
able
to
follow
his
reasoning
and
to
see
that
the
nature
and
state
of
the
various
medical
instruments
in
the
wicker
basket
which
hung
in
the
lamplight
inside
the
brougham
had
given
him
the
data
for
his
swift
deduction
the
light
in
our
window
above
showed
that
this
late
visit
was
indeed
intended
for
us
with
some
curiosity
as
to
what
could
have
sent
brother
medico
to
us
at
such
an
hour
followed
holmes
into
our
sanctum
pale
taper
faced
man
with
sandy
whiskers
rose
up
from
chair
by
the
fire
as
we
entered
his
age
may
not
have
been
more
than
three
or
four
and
thirty
but
his
haggard
expression
and
unhealthy
hue
told
of
life
which
has
sapped
his
strength
and
robbed
him
of
his
youth
his
manner
was
nervous
and
shy
like
that
of
sensitive
gentleman
and
the
thin
white
hand
which
he
laid
on
the
mantelpiece
as
he
rose
was
that
of
an
artist
rather
than
of
surgeon
his
dress
was
quiet
and
sombre
black
frock
coat
dark
trousers
and
touch
of
colour
about
his
necktie
good
evening
doctor
said
holmes
cheerily
am
glad
to
see
that
you
have
only
been
waiting
very
few
minutes
you
spoke
to
my
coachman
then
no
it
was
the
candle
on
the
side
table
that
told
me
pray
resume
your
seat
and
let
me
know
how
can
serve
you
my
name
is
doctor
percy
trevelyan
said
our
visitor
and
live
at
403
brook
street
are
you
not
the
author
of
monograph
upon
obscure
nervous
lesions
asked
his
pale
cheeks
flushed
with
pleasure
at
hearing
that
his
work
was
known
to
me
so
seldom
hear
of
the
work
that
thought
it
was
quite
dead
said
he
my
publishers
gave
me
most
discouraging
account
of
its
sale
you
are
yourself
presume
medical
man
retired
army
surgeon
my
own
hobby
has
always
been
nervous
disease
should
wish
to
make
it
an
absolute
specialty
but
of
course
man
must
take
what
he
can
get
at
first
this
however
is
beside
the
question
mr
sherlock
holmes
and
quite
appreciate
how
valuable
your
time
is
the
fact
is
that
very
singular
train
of
events
has
occurred
recently
at
my
house
in
brook
street
and
to
night
they
came
to
such
head
that
felt
it
was
quite
impossible
for
me
to
wait
another
hour
before
asking
for
your
advice
and
assistance
sherlock
holmes
sat
down
and
lit
his
pipe
you
are
very
welcome
to
both
said
he
pray
let
me
have
detailed
account
of
what
the
circumstances
are
which
have
disturbed
you
one
or
two
of
them
are
so
trivial
said
dr
trevelyan
that
really
am
almost
ashamed
to
mention
them
but
the
matter
is
so
inexplicable
and
the
recent
turn
which
it
has
taken
is
so
elaborate
that
shall
lay
it
all
before
you
and
you
shall
judge
what
is
essential
and
what
is
not
am
compelled
to
begin
with
to
say
something
of
my
own
college
career
am
london
university
man
you
know
and
am
sure
that
you
will
not
think
that
am
unduly
singing
my
own
praises
if
say
that
my
student
career
was
considered
by
my
professors
to
be
very
promising
one
after
had
graduated
continued
to
devote
myself
to
research
occupying
minor
position
in
king
college
hospital
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
excite
considerable
interest
by
my
research
into
the
pathology
of
catalepsy
and
finally
to
win
the
bruce
pinkerton
prize
and
medal
by
the
monograph
on
nervous
lesions
to
which
your
friend
has
just
alluded
should
not
go
too
far
if
were
to
say
that
there
was
general
impression
at
that
time
that
distinguished
career
lay
before
me
but
the
one
great
stumbling
block
lay
in
my
want
of
capital
as
you
will
readily
understand
specialist
who
aims
high
is
compelled
to
start
in
one
of
dozen
streets
in
the
cavendish
square
quarter
all
of
which
entail
enormous
rents
and
furnishing
expenses
besides
this
preliminary
outlay
he
must
be
prepared
to
keep
himself
for
some
years
and
to
hire
presentable
carriage
and
horse
to
do
this
was
quite
beyond
my
power
and
could
only
hope
that
by
economy
might
in
ten
years
time
save
enough
to
enable
me
to
put
up
my
plate
suddenly
however
an
unexpected
incident
opened
up
quite
new
prospect
to
me
this
was
visit
from
gentleman
of
the
name
of
blessington
who
was
complete
stranger
to
me
he
came
up
to
my
room
one
morning
and
plunged
into
business
in
an
instant
you
are
the
same
percy
trevelyan
who
has
had
so
distinguished
career
and
won
great
prize
lately
said
he
bowed
answer
me
frankly
he
continued
for
you
will
find
it
to
your
interest
to
do
so
you
have
all
the
cleverness
which
makes
successful
man
have
you
the
tact
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
abruptness
of
the
question
trust
that
have
my
share
said
any
bad
habits
not
drawn
towards
drink
eh
really
sir
cried
quite
right
that
all
right
but
was
bound
to
ask
with
all
these
qualities
why
are
you
not
in
practice
shrugged
my
shoulders
come
said
he
in
his
bustling
way
it
the
old
story
more
in
your
brains
than
in
your
pocket
eh
what
would
you
say
if
were
to
start
you
in
brook
street
stared
at
him
in
astonishment
oh
it
for
my
sake
not
for
yours
he
cried
ll
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
and
if
it
suits
you
it
will
suit
me
very
well
have
few
thousands
to
invest
ye
see
and
think
ll
sink
them
in
you
but
why
gasped
well
it
just
like
any
other
speculation
and
safer
than
most
what
am
to
do
then
ll
tell
you
ll
take
the
house
furnish
it
pay
the
maids
and
run
the
whole
place
all
you
have
to
do
is
just
to
wear
out
your
chair
in
the
consulting
room
ll
let
you
have
pocket
money
and
everything
then
you
hand
over
to
me
three
quarters
of
what
you
earn
and
you
keep
the
other
quarter
for
yourself
this
was
the
strange
proposal
mr
holmes
with
which
the
man
blessington
approached
me
won
weary
you
with
the
account
of
how
we
bargained
and
negotiated
it
ended
in
my
moving
into
the
house
next
lady
day
and
starting
in
practice
on
very
much
the
same
conditions
as
he
had
suggested
he
came
himself
to
live
with
me
in
the
character
of
resident
patient
his
heart
was
weak
it
appears
and
he
needed
constant
medical
supervision
he
turned
the
two
best
rooms
of
the
first
floor
into
sitting
room
and
bedroom
for
himself
he
was
man
of
singular
habits
shunning
company
and
very
seldom
going
out
his
life
was
irregular
but
in
one
respect
he
was
regularity
itself
every
evening
at
the
same
hour
he
walked
into
the
consulting
room
examined
the
books
put
down
five
and
three
pence
for
every
guinea
that
had
earned
and
carried
the
rest
off
to
the
strong
box
in
his
own
room
may
say
with
confidence
that
he
never
had
occasion
to
regret
his
speculation
from
the
first
it
was
success
few
good
cases
and
the
reputation
which
had
won
in
the
hospital
brought
me
rapidly
to
the
front
and
during
the
last
few
years
have
made
him
rich
man
so
much
mr
holmes
for
my
past
history
and
my
relations
with
mr
blessington
it
only
remains
for
me
now
to
tell
you
what
has
occurred
to
bring
me
here
to
night
some
weeks
ago
mr
blessington
came
down
to
me
in
as
it
seemed
to
me
state
of
considerable
agitation
he
spoke
of
some
burglary
which
he
said
had
been
committed
in
the
west
end
and
he
appeared
remember
to
be
quite
unnecessarily
excited
about
it
declaring
that
day
should
not
pass
before
we
should
add
stronger
bolts
to
our
windows
and
doors
for
week
he
continued
to
be
in
peculiar
state
of
restlessness
peering
continually
out
of
the
windows
and
ceasing
to
take
the
short
walk
which
had
usually
been
the
prelude
to
his
dinner
from
his
manner
it
struck
me
that
he
was
in
mortal
dread
of
something
or
somebody
but
when
questioned
him
upon
the
point
he
became
so
offensive
that
was
compelled
to
drop
the
subject
gradually
as
time
passed
his
fears
appeared
to
die
away
and
he
had
renewed
his
former
habits
when
fresh
event
reduced
him
to
the
pitiable
state
of
prostration
in
which
he
now
lies

this
two
days
ago
received
the
letter
which
now
read
to
you
neither
address
nor
date
is
attached
to
it
russian
nobleman
who
is
now
resident
in
england
it
runs
would
be
glad
to
avail
himself
of
the
professional
assistance
of
dr
percy
trevelyan
he
has
been
for
some
years
victim
to
cataleptic
attacks
on
which
as
is
well
known
dr
trevelyan
is
an
authority
he
proposes
to
call
at
about
quarter
past
six
to
morrow
evening
if
dr
trevelyan
will
make
it
convenient
to
be
at
home
during
my
long
and
intimate
acquaintance
with
mr
sherlock
holmes
had
never
heard
him
refer
to
his
relations
and
hardly
ever
to
his
own
early
life
this
reticence
upon
his
part
had
increased
the
somewhat
inhuman
effect
which
he
produced
upon
me
until
sometimes
found
myself
regarding
him
as
an
isolated
phenomenon
brain
without
heart
as
deficient
in
human
sympathy
as
he
was
pre
eminent
in
intelligence
his
aversion
to
women
and
his
disinclination
to
form
new
friendships
were
both
typical
of
his
unemotional
character
but
not
more
so
than
his
complete
suppression
of
every
reference
to
his
own
people
had
come
to
believe
that
he
was
an
orphan
with
no
relatives
living
but
one
day
to
my
very
great
surprise
he
began
to
talk
to
me
about
his
brother
it
was
after
tea
on
summer
evening
and
the
conversation
which
had
roamed
in
desultory
spasmodic
fashion
from
golf
clubs
to
the
causes
of
the
change
in
the
obliquity
of
the
ecliptic
came
round
at
last
to
the
question
of
atavism
and
hereditary
aptitudes
the
point
under
discussion
was
how
far
any
singular
gift
in
an
individual
was
due
to
his
ancestry
and
how
far
to
his
own
early
training
in
your
own
case
said
from
all
that
you
have
told
me
it
seems
obvious
that
your
faculty
of
observation
and
your
peculiar
facility
for
deduction
are
due
to
your
own
systematic
training
to
some
extent
he
answered
thoughtfully
my
ancestors
were
country
squires
who
appear
to
have
led
much
the
same
life
as
is
natural
to
their
class
but
none
the
less
my
turn
that
way
is
in
my
veins
and
may
have
come
with
my
grandmother
who
was
the
sister
of
vernet
the
french
artist
art
in
the
blood
is
liable
to
take
the
strangest
forms
but
how
do
you
know
that
it
is
hereditary
because
my
brother
mycroft
possesses
it
in
larger
degree
than
do
this
was
news
to
me
indeed
if
there
were
another
man
with
such
singular
powers
in
england
how
was
it
that
neither
police
nor
public
had
heard
of
him
put
the
question
with
hint
that
it
was
my
companion
modesty
which
made
him
acknowledge
his
brother
as
his
superior
holmes
laughed
at
my
suggestion

my
dear
watson
said
he
cannot
agree
with
those
who
rank
modesty
among
the
virtues
to
the
logician
all
things
should
be
seen
exactly
as
they
are
and
to
underestimate
one
self
is
as
much
departure
from
truth
as
to
exaggerate
one
own
powers
when
say
therefore
that
mycroft
has
better
powers
of
observation
than
you
may
take
it
that
am
speaking
the
exact
and
literal
truth
is
he
your
junior
seven
years
my
senior
how
comes
it
that
he
is
unknown
oh
he
is
very
well
known
in
his
own
circle
where
then
well
in
the
diogenes
club
for
example
had
never
heard
of
the
institution
and
my
face
must
have
proclaimed
as
much
for
sherlock
holmes
pulled
out
his
watch
the
diogenes
club
is
the
queerest
club
in
london
and
mycroft
one
of
the
queerest
men
he
always
there
from
quarter
to
five
to
twenty
to
eight
it
six
now
so
if
you
care
for
stroll
this
beautiful
evening
shall
be
very
happy
to
introduce
you
to
two
curiosities
five
minutes
later
we
were
in
the
street
walking
towards
regent
circus
you
wonder
said
my
companion
why
it
is
that
mycroft
does
not
use
his
powers
for
detective
work
he
is
incapable
of
it
but
thought
you
said—
said
that
he
was
my
superior
in
observation
and
deduction
if
the
art
of
the
detective
began
and
ended
in
reasoning
from
an
arm
chair
my
brother
would
be
the
greatest
criminal
agent
that
ever
lived
but
he
has
no
ambition
and
no
energy
he
will
not
even
go
out
of
his
way
to
verify
his
own
solution
and
would
rather
be
considered
wrong
than
take
the
trouble
to
prove
himself
right
again
and
again
have
taken
problem
to
him
and
have
received
an
explanation
which
has
afterwards
proved
to
be
the
correct
one
and
yet
he
was
absolutely
incapable
of
working
out
the
practical
points
which
must
be
gone
into
before
case
could
be
laid
before
judge
or
jury
it
is
not
his
profession
then
by
no
means
what
is
to
me
means
of
livelihood
is
to
him
the
merest
hobby
of
dilettante
he
has
an
extraordinary
faculty
for
figures
and
audits
the
books
in
some
of
the
government
departments
mycroft
lodges
in
pall
mall
and
he
walks
round
the
corner
into
whitehall
every
morning
and
back
every
evening
from
year
end
to
year
end
he
takes
no
other
exercise
and
is
seen
nowhere
else
except
only
in
the
diogenes
club
which
is
just
opposite
his
rooms
cannot
recall
the
name
very
likely
not
there
are
many
men
in
london
you
know
who
some
from
shyness
some
from
misanthropy
have
no
wish
for
the
company
of
their
fellows
yet
they
are
not
averse
to
comfortable
chairs
and
the
latest
periodicals
it
is
for
the
convenience
of
these
that
the
diogenes
club
was
started
and
it
now
contains
the
most
unsociable
and
unclubable
men
in
town
no
member
is
permitted
to
take
the
least
notice
of
any
other
one
save
in
the
stranger
room
no
talking
is
under
any
circumstances
allowed
and
three
offences
if
brought
to
the
notice
of
the
committee
render
the
talker
liable
to
expulsion
my
brother
was
one
of
the
founders
and
have
myself
found
it
very
soothing
atmosphere
we
had
reached
pall
mall
as
we
talked
and
were
walking
down
it
from
the
st
james
end
sherlock
holmes
stopped
at
door
some
little
distance
from
the
carlton
and
cautioning
me
not
to
speak
he
led
the
way
into
the
hall
through
the
glass
paneling
caught
glimpse
of
large
and
luxurious
room
in
which
considerable
number
of
men
were
sitting
about
and
reading
papers
each
in
his
own
little
nook
holmes
showed
me
into
small
chamber
which
looked
out
into
pall
mall
and
then
leaving
me
for
minute
he
came
back
with
companion
whom
knew
could
only
be
his
brother
mycroft
holmes
was
much
larger
and
stouter
man
than
sherlock
his
body
was
absolutely
corpulent
but
is
face
though
massive
had
preserved
something
of
the
sharpness
of
expression
which
was
so
remarkable
in
that
of
his
brother
his
eyes
which
were
of
peculiarly
light
watery
grey
seemed
to
always
retain
that
far
away
introspective
look
which
had
only
observed
in
sherlock
when
he
was
exerting
his
full
powers
am
glad
to
meet
you
sir
said
he
putting
out
broad
fat
hand
like
the
flipper
of
seal
hear
of
sherlock
everywhere
since
you
became
his
chronicler
by
the
way
sherlock
expected
to
see
you
round
last
week
to
consult
me
over
that
manor
house
case
thought
you
might
be
little
out
of
your
depth
no
solved
it
said
my
friend
smiling
it
was
adams
of
course
yes
it
was
adams
was
sure
of
it
from
the
first
the
two
sat
down
together
in
the
bow
window
of
the
club
to
any
one
who
wishes
to
study
mankind
this
is
the
spot
said
mycroft
look
at
the
magnificent
types
look
at
these
two
men
who
are
coming
towards
us
for
example
the
billiard
marker
and
the
other
precisely
what
do
you
make
of
the
other
the
two
men
had
stopped
opposite
the
window
some
chalk
marks
over
the
waistcoat
pocket
were
the
only
signs
of
billiards
which
could
see
in
one
of
them
the
other
was
very
small
dark
fellow
with
his
hat
pushed
back
and
several
packages
under
his
arm
an
old
soldier
perceive
said
sherlock
and
very
recently
discharged
remarked
the
brother
served
in
india
see
and
non
commissioned
officer
royal
artillery
fancy
said
sherlock
and
widower
but
with
child
children
my
dear
boy
children
come
said
laughing
this
is
little
too
much
surely
answered
holmes
it
is
not
hard
to
say
that
man
with
that
bearing
expression
of
authority
and
sunbaked
skin
is
soldier
is
more
than
private
and
is
not
long
from
india
that
he
has
not
left
the
service
long
is
shown
by
his
still
wearing
is
ammunition
boots
as
they
are
called
observed
mycroft
he
had
not
the
cavalry
stride
yet
he
wore
his
hat
on
one
side
as
is
shown
by
the
lighter
skin
of
that
side
of
his
brow
his
weight
is
against
his
being
sapper
he
is
in
the
artillery
then
of
course
his
complete
mourning
shows
that
he
has
lost
some
one
very
dear
the
fact
that
he
is
doing
his
own
shopping
looks
as
though
it
were
his
wife
he
has
been
buying
things
for
children
you
perceive
there
is
rattle
which
shows
that
one
of
them
is
very
young
the
wife
probably
died
in
childbed
the
fact
that
he
has
picture
book
under
his
arm
shows
that
there
is
another
child
to
be
thought
of
began
to
understand
what
my
friend
meant
when
he
said
that
his
brother
possessed
even
keener
faculties
that
he
did
himself
he
glanced
across
at
me
and
smiled
mycroft
took
snuff
from
tortoise
shell
box
and
brushed
away
the
wandering
grains
from
his
coat
front
with
large
red
silk
handkerchief
by
the
way
sherlock
said
he
have
had
something
quite
after
your
own
heart
most
singular
problem
submitted
to
my
judgment
really
had
not
the
energy
to
follow
it
up
save
in
very
incomplete
fashion
but
it
gave
me
basis
for
some
pleasing
speculation
if
you
would
care
to
hear
the
facts—
my
dear
mycroft
should
be
delighted
the
brother
scribbled
note
upon
leaf
of
his
pocket
book
and
ringing
the
bell
he
handed
it
to
the
waiter
have
asked
mr
melas
to
step
across
said
he
lodges
on
the
floor
above
me
and
have
some
slight
acquaintance
with
him
which
led
him
to
come
to
me
in
his
perplexity
mr
melas
is
greek
by
extraction
as
understand
and
he
is
remarkable
linguist
he
earns
his
living
partly
as
interpreter
in
the
law
courts
and
partly
by
acting
as
guide
to
any
wealthy
orientals
who
may
visit
the
northumberland
avenue
hotels
think
will
leave
him
to
tell
his
very
remarkable
experience
in
his
own
fashion
few
minutes
later
we
were
joined
by
short
stout
man
whose
olive
face
and
coal
black
hair
proclaimed
his
southern
origin
though
his
speech
was
that
of
an
educated
englishman
he
shook
hands
eagerly
with
sherlock
holmes
and
his
dark
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure
when
he
understood
that
the
specialist
was
anxious
to
hear
his
story
do
not
believe
that
the
police
credit
me
on
my
word
do
not
said
he
in
wailing
voice
just
because
they
have
never
heard
of
it
before
they
think
that
such
thing
cannot
be
but
know
that
shall
never
be
easy
in
my
mind
until
know
what
has
become
of
my
poor
man
with
the
sticking
plaster
upon
his
face
am
all
attention
said
sherlock
holmes
this
is
wednesday
evening
said
mr
melas
well
then
it
was
monday
night
only
two
days
ago
you
understand
that
all
this
happened
am
an
interpreter
as
perhaps
my
neighbor
there
has
told
you
interpret
all
languages
or
nearly
all
but
as
am
greek
by
birth
and
with
grecian
name
it
is
with
that
particular
tongue
that
am
principally
associated
for
many
years
have
been
the
chief
greek
interpreter
in
london
and
my
name
is
very
well
known
in
the
hotels

it
happens
not
unfrequently
that
am
sent
for
at
strange
hours
by
foreigners
who
get
into
difficulties
or
by
traveler
who
arrive
late
and
wish
my
services
was
not
surprised
therefore
on
monday
night
when
mr
latimer
very
fashionably
dressed
young
man
came
up
to
my
rooms
and
asked
me
to
accompany
him
in
cab
which
was
waiting
at
the
door
greek
friend
had
come
to
see
him
upon
business
he
said
and
as
he
could
speak
nothing
but
his
own
tongue
the
services
of
an
interpreter
were
indispensable
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
his
house
was
some
little
distance
off
in
kensington
and
he
seemed
to
be
in
great
hurry
bustling
me
rapidly
into
the
cab
when
we
had
descended
to
the
street
say
into
the
cab
but
soon
became
doubtful
as
to
whether
it
was
not
carriage
in
which
found
myself
it
was
certainly
more
roomy
than
the
ordinary
four
wheeled
disgrace
to
london
and
the
fittings
though
frayed
were
of
rich
quality
mr
latimer
seated
himself
opposite
to
me
and
we
started
off
through
charing
cross
and
up
the
shaftesbury
avenue
we
had
come
out
upon
oxford
street
and
had
ventured
some
remark
as
to
this
being
roundabout
way
to
kensington
when
my
words
were
arrested
by
the
extraordinary
conduct
of
my
companion
he
began
by
drawing
most
formidable
looking
bludgeon
loaded
with
lead
from
his
pocket
and
switching
it
backward
and
forward
several
times
as
if
to
test
its
weight
and
strength
then
he
placed
it
without
word
upon
the
seat
beside
him
having
done
this
he
drew
up
the
windows
on
each
side
and
found
to
my
astonishment
that
they
were
covered
with
paper
so
as
to
prevent
my
seeing
through
them
am
sorry
to
cut
off
your
view
mr
melas
said
he
the
fact
is
that
have
no
intention
that
you
should
see
what
the
place
is
to
which
we
are
driving
it
might
possibly
be
inconvenient
to
me
if
you
could
find
your
way
there
again
as
you
can
imagine
was
utterly
taken
aback
by
such
an
address
my
companion
was
powerful
broad
shouldered
young
fellow
and
apart
from
the
weapon
should
not
have
had
the
slightest
chance
in
struggle
with
him
this
is
very
extraordinary
conduct
mr
latimer
stammered
you
must
be
aware
that
what
you
are
doing
is
quite
illegal
it
is
somewhat
of
liberty
no
doubt
said
he
but
we
ll
make
it
up
to
you
must
warn
you
however
mr
melas
that
if
at
any
time
to
night
you
attempt
to
raise
an
alarm
or
do
anything
which
is
against
my
interests
you
will
find
it
very
serious
thing
beg
you
to
remember
that
no
one
knows
where
you
are
and
that
whether
you
are
in
this
carriage
or
in
my
house
you
are
equally
in
my
power
his
words
were
quiet
but
he
had
rasping
way
of
saying
them
which
was
very
menacing
sat
in
silence
wondering
what
on
earth
could
be
his
reason
for
kidnapping
me
in
this
extraordinary
fashion
whatever
it
might
be
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
there
was
no
possible
use
in
my
resisting
and
that
could
only
wait
to
see
what
might
befall
for
nearly
two
hours
we
drove
without
my
having
the
least
clue
as
to
where
we
were
going
sometimes
the
rattle
of
the
stones
told
of
paved
causeway
and
at
others
our
smooth
silent
course
suggested
asphalt
but
save
by
this
variation
in
sound
there
was
nothing
at
all
which
could
in
the
remotest
way
help
me
to
form
guess
as
to
where
we
were
the
paper
over
each
window
was
impenetrable
to
light
and
blue
curtain
was
drawn
across
the
glass
work
in
front
it
was
quarter
past
seven
when
we
left
pall
mall
and
my
watch
showed
me
that
it
was
ten
minutes
to
nine
when
we
at
last
came
to
standstill
my
companion
let
down
the
window
and
caught
glimpse
of
low
arched
doorway
with
lamp
burning
above
it
as
was
hurried
from
the
carriage
it
swung
open
and
found
myself
inside
the
house
with
vague
impression
of
lawn
and
trees
on
each
side
of
me
as
entered
whether
these
were
private
grounds
however
or
bona
fide
country
was
more
than
could
possibly
venture
to
say
there
was
coloured
gas
lamp
inside
which
was
turned
so
low
that
could
see
little
save
that
the
hall
was
of
some
size
and
hung
with
pictures
in
the
dim
light
could
make
out
that
the
person
who
had
opened
the
door
was
small
mean
looking
middle
aged
man
with
rounded
shoulders
as
he
turned
towards
us
the
glint
of
the
light
showed
me
that
he
was
wearing
glasses
is
this
mr
melas
harold
said
he
yes
well
done
well
done
no
ill
will
mr
melas
hope
but
we
could
not
get
on
without
you
if
you
deal
fair
with
us
you
ll
not
regret
it
but
if
you
try
any
tricks
god
help
you
he
spoke
in
nervous
jerky
fashion
and
with
little
giggling
laughs
in
between
but
somehow
he
impressed
me
with
fear
more
than
the
other
what
do
you
want
with
me
asked
only
to
ask
few
questions
of
greek
gentleman
who
is
visiting
us
and
to
let
us
have
the
answers
but
say
no
more
than
you
are
told
to
say
or—
here
came
the
nervous
giggle
again—
you
had
better
never
have
been
born
as
he
spoke
he
opened
door
and
showed
the
way
into
room
which
appeared
to
be
very
richly
furnished
but
again
the
only
light
was
afforded
by
single
lamp
half
turned
down
the
chamber
was
certainly
large
and
the
way
in
which
my
feet
sank
into
the
carpet
as
stepped
across
it
told
me
of
its
richness
caught
glimpses
of
velvet
chairs
high
white
marble
mantel
piece
and
what
seemed
to
be
suit
of
japanese
armour
at
one
side
of
it
there
was
chair
just
under
the
lamp
and
the
elderly
man
motioned
that
should
sit
in
it
the
younger
had
left
us
but
he
suddenly
returned
through
another
door
leading
with
him
gentleman
clad
in
some
sort
of
loose
dressing
gown
who
moved
slowly
towards
us
as
he
came
into
the
circle
of
dim
light
which
enables
me
to
see
him
more
clearly
was
thrilled
with
horror
at
his
appearance
he
was
deadly
pale
and
terribly
emaciated
with
the
protruding
brilliant
eyes
of
man
whose
spirit
was
greater
than
his
strength
but
what
shocked
me
more
than
any
signs
of
physical
weakness
was
that
his
face
was
grotesquely
criss
crossed
with
sticking
plaster
and
that
one
large
pad
of
it
was
fastened
over
his
mouth
have
you
the
slate
harold
cried
the
older
man
as
this
strange
being
fell
rather
than
sat
down
into
chair
are
his
hands
loose
now
then
give
him
the
pencil
you
are
to
ask
the
questions
mr
melas
and
he
will
write
the
answers
ask
him
first
of
all
whether
he
is
prepared
to
sign
the
papers
the
man
eyes
flashed
fire
never
he
wrote
in
greek
upon
the
slate
on
no
condition
asked
at
the
bidding
of
our
tyrant
only
if
see
her
married
in
my
presence
by
greek
priest
whom
know
the
man
giggled
in
his
venomous
way
you
know
what
awaits
you
then
care
nothing
for
myself
these
are
samples
of
the
questions
and
answers
which
made
up
our
strange
half
spoken
half
written
conversation
again
and
again
had
to
ask
him
whether
he
would
give
in
and
sign
the
documents
again
and
again
had
the
same
indignant
reply
but
soon
happy
thought
came
to
me
took
to
adding
on
little
sentences
of
my
own
to
each
question
innocent
ones
at
first
to
test
whether
either
of
our
companions
knew
anything
of
the
matter
and
then
as
found
that
they
showed
no
signs
played
more
dangerous
game
our
conversation
ran
something
like
this
you
can
do
no
good
by
this
obstinacy
who
are
you
care
not
am
stranger
in
london
your
fate
will
be
upon
your
own
head
how
long
have
you
been
here
let
it
be
so
three
weeks
the
property
can
never
be
yours
what
ails
you
it
shall
not
go
to
villains
they
are
starving
me
you
shall
go
free
if
you
sign
what
house
is
this
will
never
sign
do
not
know
you
are
not
doing
her
any
service
what
is
your
name
let
me
hear
her
say
so
kratides
you
shall
see
her
if
you
sign
where
are
you
from
then
shall
never
see
her
athens
another
five
minutes
mr
holmes
and
should
have
wormed
out
the
whole
story
under
their
very
noses
my
very
next
question
might
have
cleared
the
matter
up
but
at
that
instant
the
door
opened
and
woman
stepped
into
the
room
could
not
see
her
clearly
enough
to
know
more
than
that
she
was
tall
and
graceful
with
black
hair
and
clad
in
some
sort
of
loose
white
gown
harold
said
she
speaking
english
with
broken
accent
could
not
stay
away
longer
it
is
so
lonely
up
there
with
only
oh
my
god
it
is
paul
these
last
words
were
in
greek
and
at
the
same
instant
the
man
with
convulsive
effort
tore
the
plaster
from
his
lips
and
screaming
out
sophy
rushed
into
the
woman
arms
their
embrace
was
but
for
an
instant
however
for
the
younger
man
seized
the
woman
and
pushed
her
out
of
the
room
while
the
elder
easily
overpowered
his
emaciated
victim
and
dragged
him
away
through
the
other
door
for
moment
was
left
alone
in
the
room
and
sprang
to
my
feet
with
some
vague
idea
that
might
in
some
way
get
clue
to
what
this
house
was
in
which
found
myself
fortunately
however
took
no
steps
for
looking
up
saw
that
the
older
man
was
standing
in
the
door
way
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
me

that
will
do
mr
melas
said
he
you
perceive
that
we
have
taken
you
into
our
confidence
over
some
very
private
business
we
should
not
have
troubled
you
only
that
our
friend
who
speaks
greek
and
who
began
these
negotiations
has
been
forced
to
return
to
the
east
it
was
quite
necessary
for
us
to
find
some
one
to
take
his
place
and
we
were
fortunate
in
hearing
of
your
powers
bowed
there
are
five
sovereigns
here
said
he
walking
up
to
me
which
will
hope
be
sufficient
fee
but
remember
he
added
tapping
me
lightly
on
the
chest
and
giggling
if
you
speak
to
human
soul
about
this
one
human
soul
mind
well
may
god
have
mercy
upon
your
soul
cannot
tell
you
the
loathing
and
horror
with
which
this
insignificant
looking
man
inspired
me
could
see
him
better
now
as
the
lamp
light
shone
upon
him
his
features
were
peaky
and
sallow
and
his
little
pointed
beard
was
thready
and
ill
nourished
he
pushed
his
face
forward
as
he
spoke
and
his
lips
and
eyelids
were
continually
twitching
like
man
with
st
vitus
dance
could
not
help
thinking
that
his
strange
catchy
little
laugh
was
also
symptom
of
some
nervous
malady
the
terror
of
his
face
lay
in
his
eyes
however
steel
grey
and
glistening
coldly
with
malignant
inexorable
cruelty
in
their
depths
we
shall
know
if
you
speak
of
this
said
he
we
have
our
own
means
of
information
now
you
will
find
the
carriage
waiting
and
my
friend
will
see
you
on
your
way
was
hurried
through
the
hall
and
into
the
vehicle
again
obtaining
that
momentary
glimpse
of
trees
and
garden
mr
latimer
followed
closely
at
my
heels
and
took
his
place
opposite
to
me
without
word
in
silence
we
again
drove
for
an
interminable
distance
with
the
windows
raised
until
at
last
just
after
midnight
the
carriage
pulled
up
you
will
get
down
here
mr
melas
said
my
companion
am
sorry
to
leave
you
so
far
from
your
house
but
there
is
no
alternative
any
attempt
upon
your
part
to
follow
the
carriage
can
only
end
in
injury
to
yourself
he
opened
the
door
as
he
spoke
and
had
hardly
time
to
spring
out
when
the
coachman
lashed
the
horse
and
the
carriage
rattled
away
looked
around
me
in
astonishment
was
on
some
sort
of
heathy
common
mottled
over
with
dark
clumps
of
furze
bushes
far
away
stretched
line
of
houses
with
light
here
and
there
in
the
upper
windows
on
the
other
side
saw
the
red
signal
lamps
of
railway
the
carriage
which
had
brought
me
was
already
out
of
sight
stood
gazing
round
and
wondering
where
on
earth
might
be
when
saw
some
one
coming
towards
me
in
the
darkness
as
he
came
up
to
me
made
out
that
he
was
railway
porter
can
you
tell
me
what
place
this
is
asked
wandsworth
common
said
he
can
get
train
into
town
if
you
walk
on
mile
or
so
to
clapham
junction
said
he
you
ll
just
be
in
time
for
the
last
to
victoria
so
that
was
the
end
of
my
adventure
mr
holmes
do
not
know
where
was
nor
whom
spoke
with
nor
anything
save
what
have
told
you
but
know
that
there
is
foul
play
going
on
and
want
to
help
that
unhappy
man
if
can
told
the
whole
story
to
mr
mycroft
holmes
next
morning
and
subsequently
to
the
police
we
all
sat
in
silence
for
some
little
time
after
listening
to
this
extraordinary
narrative
then
sherlock
looked
across
at
his
brother
any
steps
he
asked
mycroft
picked
up
the
daily
news
which
was
lying
on
the
side
table
anybody
supplying
any
information
to
the
whereabouts
of
greek
gentleman
named
paul
kratides
from
athens
who
is
unable
to
speak
english
will
be
rewarded
similar
reward
paid
to
any
one
giving
information
about
greek
lady
whose
first
name
is
sophy
2473
that
was
in
all
the
dailies
no
answer
how
about
the
greek
legation
have
inquired
they
know
nothing
wire
to
the
head
of
the
athens
police
then
sherlock
has
all
the
energy
of
the
family
said
mycroft
turning
to
me
well
you
take
the
case
up
by
all
means
and
let
me
know
if
you
do
any
good
certainly
answered
my
friend
rising
from
his
chair
ll
let
you
know
and
mr
melas
also
in
the
meantime
mr
melas
should
certainly
be
on
my
guard
if
were
you
for
of
course
they
must
know
through
these
advertisements
that
you
have
betrayed
them
as
we
walked
home
together
holmes
stopped
at
telegraph
office
and
sent
off
several
wires
you
see
watson
he
remarked
our
evening
has
been
by
no
means
wasted
some
of
my
most
interesting
cases
have
come
to
me
in
this
way
through
mycroft
the
problem
which
we
have
just
listened
to
although
it
can
admit
of
but
one
explanation
has
still
some
distinguishing
features
you
have
hopes
of
solving
it
well
knowing
as
much
as
we
do
it
will
be
singular
indeed
if
we
fail
to
discover
the
rest
you
must
yourself
have
formed
some
theory
which
will
explain
the
facts
to
which
we
have
listened
in
vague
way
yes
what
was
your
idea
then
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
obvious
that
this
greek
girl
had
been
carried
off
by
the
young
englishman
named
harold
latimer
carried
off
from
where
athens
perhaps
sherlock
holmes
shook
his
head
this
young
man
could
not
talk
word
of
greek
the
lady
could
talk
english
fairly
well
inference
that
she
had
been
in
england
some
little
time
but
he
had
not
been
in
greece
well
then
we
will
presume
that
she
had
come
on
visit
to
england
and
that
this
harold
had
persuaded
her
to
fly
with
him
that
is
more
probable
then
the
brother
for
that
fancy
must
be
the
relationship
comes
over
from
greece
to
interfere
he
imprudently
puts
himself
into
the
power
of
the
young
man
and
his
older
associate
they
seize
him
and
use
violence
towards
him
in
order
to
make
him
sign
some
papers
to
make
over
the
girl
fortune
of
which
he
may
be
trustee
to
them
this
he
refuses
to
do
in
order
to
negotiate
with
him
they
have
to
get
an
interpreter
and
they
pitch
upon
this
mr
melas
having
used
some
other
one
before
the
girl
is
not
told
of
the
arrival
of
her
brother
and
finds
it
out
by
the
merest
accident
excellent
watson
cried
holmes
really
fancy
that
you
are
not
far
from
the
truth
you
see
that
we
hold
all
the
cards
and
we
have
only
to
fear
some
sudden
act
of
violence
on
their
part
if
they
give
us
time
we
must
have
them
but
how
can
we
find
where
this
house
lies
well
if
our
conjecture
is
correct
and
the
girl
name
is
or
was
sophy
kratides
we
should
have
no
difficulty
in
tracing
her
that
must
be
our
main
hope
for
the
brother
is
of
course
complete
stranger
it
is
clear
that
some
time
has
elapsed
since
this
harold
established
these
relations
with
the
girl
some
weeks
at
any
rate
since
the
brother
in
greece
has
had
time
to
hear
of
it
and
come
across
if
they
have
been
living
in
the
same
place
during
this
time
it
is
probable
that
we
shall
have
some
answer
to
mycroft
advertisement
we
had
reached
our
house
in
baker
street
while
we
had
been
talking
holmes
ascended
the
stair
first
and
as
he
opened
the
door
of
our
room
he
gave
start
of
surprise
looking
over
his
shoulder
was
equally
astonished
his
brother
mycroft
was
sitting
smoking
in
the
arm
chair
come
in
sherlock
come
in
sir
said
he
blandly
smiling
at
our
surprised
faces
you
don
expect
such
energy
from
me
do
you
sherlock
but
somehow
this
case
attracts
me
how
did
you
get
here
passed
you
in
hansom
there
has
been
some
new
development
had
an
answer
to
my
advertisement
ah
yes
it
came
within
few
minutes
of
your
leaving
and
to
what
effect
mycroft
holmes
took
out
sheet
of
paper
here
it
is
said
he
written
with
pen
on
royal
cream
paper
by
middle
aged
man
with
weak
constitution
sir
he
says
in
answer
to
your
advertisement
of
to
day
date
beg
to
inform
you
that
know
the
young
lady
in
question
very
well
if
you
should
care
to
call
upon
me
could
give
you
some
particulars
as
to
her
painful
history
she
is
living
at
present
at
the
myrtles
beckenham
yours
faithfully
davenport
he
writes
from
lower
brixton
said
mycroft
holmes
do
you
not
think
that
we
might
drive
to
him
now
sherlock
and
learn
these
particulars
my
dear
mycroft
the
brother
life
is
more
valuable
than
the
sister
story
think
we
should
call
at
scotland
yard
for
inspector
gregson
and
go
straight
out
to
beckenham
we
know
that
man
is
being
done
to
death
and
every
hour
may
be
vital
better
pick
up
mr
melas
on
our
way
suggested
we
may
need
an
interpreter
excellent
said
sherlock
holmes
send
the
boy
for
four
wheeler
and
we
shall
be
off
at
once
he
opened
the
table
drawer
as
he
spoke
and
noticed
that
he
slipped
his
revolver
into
his
pocket
yes
said
he
in
answer
to
my
glance
should
say
from
what
we
have
heard
that
we
are
dealing
with
particularly
dangerous
gang

it
was
almost
dark
before
we
found
ourselves
in
pall
mall
at
the
rooms
of
mr
melas
gentleman
had
just
called
for
him
and
he
was
gone
can
you
tell
me
where
asked
mycroft
holmes
don
know
sir
answered
the
woman
who
had
opened
the
door
only
know
that
he
drove
away
with
the
gentleman
in
carriage
did
the
gentleman
give
name
no
sir
he
wasn
tall
handsome
dark
young
man
oh
nor
sir
he
was
little
gentleman
with
glasses
thin
in
the
face
but
very
pleasant
in
his
ways
for
he
was
laughing
al
the
time
that
he
was
talking
come
along
cried
sherlock
holmes
abruptly
this
grows
serious
he
observed
as
we
drove
to
scotland
yard
these
men
have
got
hold
of
melas
again
he
is
man
of
no
physical
courage
as
they
are
well
aware
from
their
experience
the
other
night
this
villain
was
able
to
terrorize
him
the
instant
that
he
got
into
his
presence
no
doubt
they
want
his
professional
services
but
having
used
him
they
may
be
inclined
to
punish
him
for
what
they
will
regard
as
his
treachery
our
hope
was
that
by
taking
train
we
might
get
to
beckenham
as
soon
or
sooner
than
the
carriage
on
reaching
scotland
yard
however
it
was
more
than
an
hour
before
we
could
get
inspector
gregson
and
comply
with
the
legal
formalities
which
would
enable
us
to
enter
the
house
it
was
quarter
to
ten
before
we
reached
london
bridge
and
half
past
before
the
four
of
us
alighted
on
the
beckenham
platform
drive
of
half
mile
brought
us
to
the
myrtles
large
dark
house
standing
back
from
the
road
in
its
own
grounds
here
we
dismissed
our
cab
and
made
our
way
up
the
drive
together
the
windows
are
all
dark
remarked
the
inspector
the
house
seems
deserted
our
birds
are
flown
and
the
nest
empty
said
holmes
why
do
you
say
so
carriage
heavily
loaded
with
luggage
has
passed
out
during
the
last
hour
the
inspector
laughed
saw
the
wheel
tracks
in
the
light
of
the
gate
lamp
but
where
does
the
luggage
come
in
you
may
have
observed
the
same
wheel
tracks
going
the
other
way
but
the
outward
bound
ones
were
very
much
deeper
so
much
so
that
we
can
say
for
certainty
that
there
was
very
considerable
weight
on
the
carriage
you
get
trifle
beyond
me
there
said
the
inspector
shrugging
his
shoulder
it
will
not
be
an
easy
door
to
force
but
we
will
try
if
we
cannot
make
some
one
hear
us
he
hammered
loudly
at
the
knocker
and
pulled
at
the
bell
but
without
any
success
holmes
had
slipped
away
but
he
came
back
in
few
minutes
have
window
open
said
he
it
is
mercy
that
you
are
on
the
side
of
the
force
and
not
against
it
mr
holmes
remarked
the
inspector
as
he
noted
the
clever
way
in
which
my
friend
had
forced
back
the
catch
well
think
that
under
the
circumstances
we
may
enter
without
an
invitation
one
after
the
other
we
made
our
way
into
large
apartment
which
was
evidently
that
in
which
mr
melas
had
found
himself
the
inspector
had
lit
his
lantern
and
by
its
light
we
could
see
the
two
doors
the
curtain
the
lamp
and
the
suit
of
japanese
mail
as
he
had
described
them
on
the
table
lay
two
glasses
and
empty
brandy
bottle
and
the
remains
of
meal
what
is
that
asked
holmes
suddenly
we
all
stood
still
and
listened
low
moaning
sound
was
coming
from
somewhere
over
our
heads
holmes
rushed
to
the
door
and
out
into
the
hall
the
dismal
noise
came
from
upstairs
he
dashed
up
the
inspector
and
at
his
heels
while
his
brother
mycroft
followed
as
quickly
as
his
great
bulk
would
permit
three
doors
faced
up
upon
the
second
floor
and
it
was
from
the
central
of
these
that
the
sinister
sounds
were
issuing
sinking
sometimes
into
dull
mumble
and
rising
again
into
shrill
whine
it
was
locked
but
the
key
had
been
left
on
the
outside
holmes
flung
open
the
door
and
rushed
in
but
he
was
out
again
in
an
instant
with
his
hand
to
his
throat
it
charcoal
he
cried
give
it
time
it
will
clear
peering
in
we
could
see
that
the
only
light
in
the
room
came
from
dull
blue
flame
which
flickered
from
small
brass
tripod
in
the
centre
it
threw
livid
unnatural
circle
upon
the
floor
while
in
the
shadows
beyond
we
saw
the
vague
loom
of
two
figures
which
crouched
against
the
wall
from
the
open
door
there
reeked
horrible
poisonous
exhalation
which
set
us
gasping
and
coughing
holmes
rushed
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
to
draw
in
the
fresh
air
and
then
dashing
into
the
room
he
threw
up
the
window
and
hurled
the
brazen
tripod
out
into
the
garden
we
can
enter
in
minute
he
gasped
darting
out
again
where
is
candle
doubt
if
we
could
strike
match
in
that
atmosphere
hold
the
light
at
the
door
and
we
shall
get
them
out
mycroft
now
with
rush
we
got
to
the
poisoned
men
and
dragged
them
out
into
the
well
lit
hall
both
of
them
were
blue
lipped
and
insensible
with
swollen
congested
faces
and
protruding
eyes
indeed
so
distorted
were
their
features
that
save
for
his
black
beard
and
stout
figure
we
might
have
failed
to
recognize
in
one
of
them
the
greek
interpreter
who
had
parted
from
us
only
few
hours
before
at
the
diogenes
club
his
hands
and
feet
were
securely
strapped
together
and
he
bore
over
one
eye
the
marks
of
violent
blow
the
other
who
was
secured
in
similar
fashion
was
tall
man
in
the
last
stage
of
emaciation
with
several
strips
of
sticking
plaster
arranged
in
grotesque
pattern
over
his
face
he
had
ceased
to
moan
as
we
laid
him
down
and
glance
showed
me
that
for
him
at
least
our
aid
had
come
too
late
mr
melas
however
still
lived
and
in
less
than
an
hour
with
the
aid
of
ammonia
and
brandy
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
open
his
eyes
and
of
knowing
that
my
hand
had
drawn
him
back
from
that
dark
valley
in
which
all
paths
meet
it
was
simple
story
which
he
had
to
tell
and
one
which
did
but
confirm
our
own
deductions
his
visitor
on
entering
his
rooms
had
drawn
life
preserver
from
his
sleeve
and
had
so
impressed
him
with
the
fear
of
instant
and
inevitable
death
that
he
had
kidnapped
him
for
the
second
time
indeed
it
was
almost
mesmeric
the
effect
which
this
giggling
ruffian
had
produced
upon
the
unfortunate
linguist
for
he
could
not
speak
of
him
save
with
trembling
hands
and
blanched
cheek
he
had
been
taken
swiftly
to
beckenham
and
had
acted
as
interpreter
in
second
interview
even
more
dramatic
than
the
first
in
which
the
two
englishmen
had
menaced
their
prisoner
with
instant
death
if
he
did
not
comply
with
their
demands
finally
finding
him
proof
against
every
threat
they
had
hurled
him
back
into
his
prison
and
after
reproaching
melas
with
his
treachery
which
appeared
from
the
newspaper
advertisement
they
had
stunned
him
with
blow
from
stick
and
he
remembered
nothing
more
until
he
found
us
bending
over
him
and
this
was
the
singular
case
of
the
grecian
interpreter
the
explanation
of
which
is
still
involved
in
some
mystery
we
were
able
to
find
out
by
communicating
with
the
gentleman
who
had
answered
the
advertisement
that
the
unfortunate
young
lady
came
of
wealthy
grecian
family
and
that
she
had
been
on
visit
to
some
friends
in
england
while
there
she
had
met
young
man
named
harold
latimer
who
had
acquired
an
ascendancy
over
he
and
had
eventually
persuaded
her
to
fly
with
him
her
friends
shocked
at
the
event
had
contented
themselves
with
informing
her
brother
at
athens
and
had
then
washed
their
hands
of
the
matter
the
brother
on
his
arrival
in
england
had
imprudently
placed
himself
in
the
power
of
latimer
and
of
his
associate
whose
name
was
wilson
kemp
that
through
his
ignorance
of
the
language
he
was
helpless
in
their
hands
had
kept
him
prisoner
and
had
endeavored
by
cruelty
and
starvation
to
make
him
sign
away
his
own
and
his
sister
property
they
had
kept
him
in
the
house
without
the
girl
knowledge
and
the
plaster
over
the
face
had
been
for
the
purpose
of
making
recognition
difficult
in
case
she
should
ever
catch
glimpse
of
him
her
feminine
perception
however
had
instantly
seen
through
the
disguise
when
on
the
occasion
of
the
interpreter
visit
she
had
seen
him
for
the
first
time
the
poor
girl
however
was
herself
prisoner
for
there
was
no
one
about
the
house
except
the
man
who
acted
as
coachman
and
his
wife
both
of
whom
were
tools
of
the
conspirators
finding
that
their
secret
was
out
and
that
their
prisoner
was
not
to
be
coerced
the
two
villains
with
the
girl
had
fled
away
at
few
hours
notice
from
the
furnished
house
which
they
had
hired
having
first
as
they
thought
taken
vengeance
both
upon
the
man
who
had
defied
and
the
one
who
had
betrayed
them
months
afterwards
curious
newspaper
cutting
reached
us
from
buda
pesth
it
told
how
two
englishmen
who
had
been
traveling
with
woman
had
met
with
tragic
end
they
had
each
been
stabbed
it
seems
and
the
hungarian
police
were
of
opinion
that
they
had
quarreled
and
had
inflicted
mortal
injuries
upon
each
other
holmes
however
is
fancy
of
different
way
of
thinking
and
holds
to
this
day
that
if
one
could
find
the
grecian
girl
one
might
learn
how
the
wrongs
of
herself
and
her
brother
came
to
be
avenged

the
naval
treaty
the
july
which
immediately
succeeded
my
marriage
was
made
memorable
by
three
cases
of
interest
in
which
had
the
privilege
of
being
associated
with
sherlock
holmes
and
of
studying
his
methods
find
them
recorded
in
my
notes
under
the
headings
of
the
adventure
of
the
second
stain
the
adventure
of
the
naval
treaty
and
the
adventure
of
the
tired
captain
the
first
of
these
however
deals
with
interest
of
such
importance
and
implicates
so
many
of
the
first
families
in
the
kingdom
that
for
many
years
it
will
be
impossible
to
make
it
public
no
case
however
in
which
holmes
was
engaged
has
ever
illustrated
the
value
of
his
analytical
methods
so
clearly
or
has
impressed
those
who
were
associated
with
him
so
deeply
still
retain
an
almost
verbatim
report
of
the
interview
in
which
he
demonstrated
the
true
facts
of
the
case
to
monsieur
dubugue
of
the
paris
police
and
fritz
von
waldbaum
the
well
known
specialist
of
dantzig
both
of
whom
had
wasted
their
energies
upon
what
proved
to
be
side
issues
the
new
century
will
have
come
however
before
the
story
can
be
safely
told
meanwhile
pass
on
to
the
second
on
my
list
which
promised
also
at
one
time
to
be
of
national
importance
and
was
marked
by
several
incidents
which
give
it
quite
unique
character
during
my
school
days
had
been
intimately
associated
with
lad
named
percy
phelps
who
was
of
much
the
same
age
as
myself
though
he
was
two
classes
ahead
of
me
he
was
very
brilliant
boy
and
carried
away
every
prize
which
the
school
had
to
offer
finished
his
exploits
by
winning
scholarship
which
sent
him
on
to
continue
his
triumphant
career
at
cambridge
he
was
remember
extremely
well
connected
and
even
when
we
were
all
little
boys
together
we
knew
that
his
mother
brother
was
lord
holdhurst
the
great
conservative
politician
this
gaudy
relationship
did
him
little
good
at
school
on
the
contrary
it
seemed
rather
piquant
thing
to
us
to
chevy
him
about
the
playground
and
hit
him
over
the
shins
with
wicket
but
it
was
another
thing
when
he
came
out
into
the
world
heard
vaguely
that
his
abilities
and
the
influences
which
he
commanded
had
won
him
good
position
at
the
foreign
office
and
then
he
passed
completely
out
of
my
mind
until
the
following
letter
recalled
his
existence
briarbrae
woking
my
dear
watson
have
no
doubt
that
you
can
remember
tadpole
phelps
who
was
in
the
fifth
form
when
you
were
in
the
third
it
is
possible
even
that
you
may
have
heard
that
through
my
uncle
influence
obtained
good
appointment
at
the
foreign
office
and
that
was
in
situation
of
trust
and
honour
until
horrible
misfortune
came
suddenly
to
blast
my
career
there
is
no
use
writing
of
the
details
of
that
dreadful
event
in
the
event
of
your
acceding
to
my
request
it
is
probably
that
shall
have
to
narrate
them
to
you
have
only
just
recovered
from
nine
weeks
of
brain
fever
and
am
still
exceedingly
weak
do
you
think
that
you
could
bring
your
friend
mr
holmes
down
to
see
me
should
like
to
have
his
opinion
of
the
case
though
the
authorities
assure
me
that
nothing
more
can
be
done
do
try
to
bring
him
down
and
as
soon
as
possible
every
minute
seems
an
hour
while
live
in
this
state
of
horrible
suspense
assure
him
that
if
have
not
asked
his
advice
sooner
it
was
not
because
did
not
appreciate
his
talents
but
because
have
been
off
my
head
ever
since
the
blow
fell
now
am
clear
again
though
dare
not
think
of
it
too
much
for
fear
of
relapse
am
still
so
weak
that
have
to
write
as
you
see
by
dictating
do
try
to
bring
him
your
old
school
fellow
percy
phelps
there
was
something
that
touched
me
as
read
this
letter
something
pitiable
in
the
reiterated
appeals
to
bring
holmes
so
moved
was
that
even
had
it
been
difficult
matter
should
have
tried
it
but
of
course
knew
well
that
holmes
loved
his
art
so
that
he
was
ever
as
ready
to
bring
his
aid
as
his
client
could
be
to
receive
it
my
wife
agreed
with
me
that
not
moment
should
be
lost
in
laying
the
matter
before
him
and
so
within
an
hour
of
breakfast
time
found
myself
back
once
more
in
the
old
rooms
in
baker
street
holmes
was
seated
at
his
side
table
clad
in
his
dressing
gown
and
working
hard
over
chemical
investigation
large
curved
retort
was
boiling
furiously
in
the
bluish
flame
of
bunsen
burner
and
the
distilled
drops
were
condensing
into
two
litre
measure
my
friend
hardly
glanced
up
as
entered
and
seeing
that
his
investigation
must
be
of
importance
seated
myself
in
an
arm
chair
and
waited
he
dipped
into
this
bottle
or
that
drawing
out
few
drops
of
each
with
his
glass
pipette
and
finally
brought
test
tube
containing
solution
over
to
the
table
in
his
right
hand
he
held
slip
of
litmus
paper
you
come
at
crisis
watson
said
he
if
this
paper
remains
blue
all
is
well
if
it
turns
red
it
means
man
life
he
dipped
it
into
the
test
tube
and
it
flushed
at
once
into
dull
dirty
crimson
hum
thought
as
much
he
cried
will
be
at
your
service
in
an
instant
watson
you
will
find
tobacco
in
the
persian
slipper
he
turned
to
his
desk
and
scribbled
off
several
telegrams
which
were
handed
over
to
the
page
boy
then
he
threw
himself
down
into
the
chair
opposite
and
drew
up
his
knees
until
his
fingers
clasped
round
his
long
thin
shins
very
commonplace
little
murder
said
he
you
ve
got
something
better
fancy
you
are
the
stormy
petrel
of
crime
watson
what
is
it
handed
him
the
letter
which
he
read
with
the
most
concentrated
attention
it
does
not
tell
us
very
much
does
it
he
remarked
as
he
handed
it
back
to
me
hardly
anything
and
yet
the
writing
is
of
interest
but
the
writing
is
not
his
own
precisely
it
is
woman
man
surely
cried
no
woman
and
woman
of
rare
character
you
see
at
the
commencement
of
an
investigation
it
is
something
to
know
that
your
client
is
in
close
contact
with
some
one
who
for
good
or
evil
has
an
exceptional
nature
my
interest
is
already
awakened
in
the
case
if
you
are
ready
we
will
start
at
once
for
woking
and
see
this
diplomatist
who
is
in
such
evil
case
and
the
lady
to
whom
he
dictates
his
letters
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
catch
an
early
train
at
waterloo
and
in
little
under
an
hour
we
found
ourselves
among
the
fir
woods
and
the
heather
of
woking
briarbrae
proved
to
be
large
detached
house
standing
in
extensive
grounds
within
few
minutes
walk
of
the
station
on
sending
in
our
cards
we
were
shown
into
an
elegantly
appointed
drawing
room
where
we
were
joined
in
few
minutes
by
rather
stout
man
who
received
us
with
much
hospitality
his
age
may
have
been
nearer
forty
than
thirty
but
his
cheeks
were
so
ruddy
and
his
eyes
so
merry
that
he
still
conveyed
the
impression
of
plump
and
mischievous
boy
am
so
glad
that
you
have
come
said
he
shaking
our
hands
with
effusion
percy
has
been
inquiring
for
you
all
morning
ah
poor
old
chap
he
clings
to

his
father
and
his
mother
asked
me
to
see
you
for
the
mere
mention
of
the
subject
is
very
painful
to
them
we
have
had
no
details
yet
observed
holmes
perceive
that
you
are
not
yourself
member
of
the
family
our
acquaintance
looked
surprised
and
then
glancing
down
he
began
to
laugh
of
course
you
saw
the
monogram
on
my
locket
said
he
for
moment
thought
you
had
done
something
clever
joseph
harrison
is
my
name
and
as
percy
is
to
marry
my
sister
annie
shall
at
least
be
relation
by
marriage
you
will
find
my
sister
in
his
room
for
she
has
nursed
him
hand
and
foot
this
two
months
back
perhaps
we
better
go
in
at
once
for
know
how
impatient
he
is
the
chamber
in
which
we
were
shown
was
on
the
same
floor
as
the
drawing
room
it
was
furnished
partly
as
sitting
and
partly
as
bedroom
with
flowers
arranged
daintily
in
every
nook
and
corner
young
man
very
pale
and
worn
was
lying
upon
sofa
near
the
open
window
through
which
came
the
rich
scent
of
the
garden
and
the
balmy
summer
air
woman
was
sitting
beside
him
who
rose
as
we
entered
shall
leave
percy
she
asked
he
clutched
her
hand
to
detain
her
how
are
you
watson
said
he
cordially
should
never
have
known
you
under
that
moustache
and
dare
say
you
would
not
be
prepared
to
swear
to
me
this
presume
is
your
celebrated
friend
mr
sherlock
holmes
introduced
him
in
few
words
and
we
both
sat
down
the
stout
young
man
had
left
us
but
his
sister
still
remained
with
her
hand
in
that
of
the
invalid
she
was
striking
looking
woman
little
short
and
thick
for
symmetry
but
with
beautiful
olive
complexion
large
dark
italian
eyes
and
wealth
of
deep
black
hair
her
rich
tints
made
the
white
face
of
her
companion

won
waste
your
time
said
he
raising
himself
upon
the
sofa
ll
plunge
into
the
matter
without
further
preamble
was
happy
and
successful
man
mr
holmes
and
on
the
eve
of
being
married
when
sudden
and
dreadful
misfortune
wrecked
all
my
prospects
in
life
was
as
watson
may
have
told
you
in
the
foreign
office
and
through
the
influences
of
my
uncle
lord
holdhurst
rose
rapidly
to
responsible
position
when
my
uncle
became
foreign
minister
in
this
administration
he
gave
me
several
missions
of
trust
and
as
always
brought
them
to
successful
conclusion
he
came
at
last
to
have
the
utmost
confidence
in
my
ability
and
tact
nearly
ten
weeks
ago
to
be
more
accurate
on
the
23d
of
may
he
called
me
into
his
private
room
and
after
complimenting
me
on
the
good
work
which
had
done
he
informed
me
that
he
had
new
commission
of
trust
for
me
to
execute
this
said
he
taking
grey
roll
of
paper
from
his
bureau
is
the
original
of
that
secret
treaty
between
england
and
italy
of
which
regret
to
say
some
rumors
have
already
got
into
the
public
press
it
is
of
enormous
importance
that
nothing
further
should
leak
out
the
french
or
the
russian
embassy
would
pay
an
immense
sum
to
learn
the
contents
of
these
papers
they
should
not
leave
my
bureau
were
it
not
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
have
them
copied
you
have
desk
in
your
office
yes
sir
then
take
the
treaty
and
lock
it
up
there
shall
give
directions
that
you
may
remain
behind
when
the
others
go
so
that
you
may
copy
it
at
your
leisure
without
fear
of
being
overlooked
when
you
have
finished
relock
both
the
original
and
the
draft
in
the
desk
and
hand
them
over
to
me
personally
to
morrow
morning
took
the
papers
and—
excuse
me
an
instant
said
holmes
were
you
alone
during
this
conversation
absolutely
in
large
room
thirty
feet
each
way
in
the
centre
yes
about
it
and
speaking
low
my
uncle
voice
is
always
remarkably
low
hardly
spoke
at
all
thank
you
said
holmes
shutting
his
eyes
pray
go
on
did
exactly
what
he
indicated
and
waited
until
the
other
clerks
had
departed
one
of
them
in
my
room
charles
gorot
had
some
arrears
of
work
to
make
up
so
left
him
there
and
went
out
to
dine
when
returned
he
was
gone
was
anxious
to
hurry
my
work
for
knew
that
joseph
the
mr
harrison
whom
you
saw
just
now
was
in
town
and
that
he
would
travel
down
to
woking
by
the
eleven
clock
train
and
wanted
if
possible
to
catch
it
when
came
to
examine
the
treaty
saw
at
once
that
it
was
of
such
importance
that
my
uncle
had
been
guilty
of
no
exaggeration
in
what
he
had
said
without
going
into
details
may
say
that
it
defined
the
position
of
great
britain
towards
the
triple
alliance
and
fore
shadowed
the
policy
which
this
country
would
pursue
in
the
event
of
the
french
fleet
gaining
complete
ascendancy
over
that
of
italy
in
the
mediterranean
the
questions
treated
in
it
were
purely
naval
at
the
end
were
the
signatures
of
the
high
dignitaries
who
had
signed
it
glanced
my
eyes
over
it
and
then
settled
down
to
my
task
of
copying
it
was
long
document
written
in
the
french
language
and
containing
twenty
six
separate
articles
copied
as
quickly
as
could
but
at
nine
clock
had
only
done
nine
articles
and
it
seemed
hopeless
for
me
to
attempt
to
catch
my
train
was
feeling
drowsy
and
stupid
partly
from
my
dinner
and
also
from
the
effects
of
long
day
work
cup
of
coffee
would
clear
my
brain
commissionnaire
remains
all
night
in
little
lodge
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
is
in
the
habit
of
making
coffee
at
his
spirit
lamp
for
any
of
the
officials
who
may
be
working
over
time
rang
the
bell
therefore
to
summon
him
to
my
surprise
it
was
woman
who
answered
the
summons
large
coarse
faced
elderly
woman
in
an
apron
she
explained
that
she
was
the
commissionnaire
wife
who
did
the
charing
and
gave
her
the
order
for
the
coffee
wrote
two
more
articles
and
then
feeling
more
drowsy
than
ever
rose
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
to
stretch
my
legs
my
coffee
had
not
yet
come
and
wondered
what
was
the
cause
of
the
delay
could
be
opening
the
door
started
down
the
corridor
to
find
out
there
was
straight
passage
dimly
lighted
which
led
from
the
room
in
which
had
been
working
and
was
the
only
exit
from
it
ended
in
curving
staircase
with
the
commissionnaire
lodge
in
the
passage
at
the
bottom
half
way
down
this
staircase
is
small
landing
with
another
passage
running
into
it
at
right
angles
this
second
one
leads
by
means
of
second
small
stair
to
side
door
used
by
servants
and
also
as
short
cut
by
clerks
when
coming
from
charles
street
here
is
rough
chart
of
the
place
thank
you
think
that
quite
follow
you
said
sherlock
holmes
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
you
should
notice
this
point
went
down
the
stairs
and
into
the
hall
where
found
the
commissionnaire
fast
asleep
in
his
box
with
the
kettle
boiling
furiously
upon
the
spirit
lamp
took
off
the
kettle
and
blew
out
the
lamp
for
the
water
was
spurting
over
the
floor
then
put
out
my
hand
and
was
about
to
shake
the
man
who
was
still
sleeping
soundly
when
bell
over
his
head
rang
loudly
and
he
woke
with
start
mr
phelps
sir
said
he
looking
at
me
in
bewilderment
came
down
to
see
if
my
coffee
was
ready
was
boiling
the
kettle
when
fell
asleep
sir
he
looked
at
me
and
then
up
at
the
still
quivering
bell
with
an
ever
growing
astonishment
upon
his
face
if
you
was
here
sir
then
who
rang
the
bell
he
asked
the
bell
cried
what
bell
is
it
the
bell
of
the
room
you
were
working
in
cold
hand
seemed
to
close
round
my
heart
some
one
then
was
in
that
room
where
my
precious
treaty
lay
upon
the
table
ran
frantically
up
the
stair
and
along
the
passage
there
was
no
one
in
the
corridors
mr
holmes
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
all
was
exactly
as
left
it
save
only
that
the
papers
which
had
been
committed
to
my
care
had
been
taken
from
the
desk
on
which
they
lay
the
copy
was
there
and
the
original
was
gone
holmes
sat
up
in
his
chair
and
rubbed
his
hands
could
see
that
the
problem
was
entirely
to
his
heart
pray
what
did
you
do
then
he
murmured
recognized
in
an
instant
that
the
thief
must
have
come
up
the
stairs
from
the
side
door
of
course
must
have
met
him
if
he
had
come
the
other
way
you
were
satisfied
that
he
could
not
have
been
concealed
in
the
room
all
the
time
or
in
the
corridor
which
you
have
just
described
as
dimly
lighted
it
is
absolutely
impossible
rat
could
not
conceal
himself
either
in
the
room
or
the
corridor
there
is
no
cover
at
all
thank
you
pray
proceed
the
commissionnaire
seeing
by
my
pale
face
that
something
was
to
be
feared
had
followed
me
upstairs
now
we
both
rushed
along
the
corridor
and
down
the
steep
steps
which
led
to
charles
street
the
door
at
the
bottom
was
closed
but
unlocked
we
flung
it
open
and
rushed
out
can
distinctly
remember
that
as
we
did
so
there
came
three
chines
from
neighboring
clock
it
was
quarter
to
ten
that
is
of
enormous
importance
said
holmes
making
note
upon
his
shirt
cuff
the
night
was
very
dark
and
thin
warm
rain
was
falling
there
was
no
one
in
charles
street
but
great
traffic
was
going
on
as
usual
in
whitehall
at
the
extremity
we
rushed
along
the
pavement
bare
headed
as
we
were
and
at
the
far
corner
we
found
policeman
standing
robbery
has
been
committed
gasped
document
of
immense
value
has
been
stolen
from
the
foreign
office
has
any
one
passed
this
way
have
been
standing
here
for
quarter
of
an
hour
sir
said
he
only
one
person
has
passed
during
that
time
woman
tall
and
elderly
with
paisley
shawl
ah
that
is
only
my
wife
cried
the
commissionnaire
has
no
one
else
passed
no
one
then
it
must
be
the
other
way
that
the
thief
took
cried
the
fellow
tugging
at
my
sleeve
but
was
not
satisfied
and
the
attempts
which
he
made
to
draw
me
away
increased
my
suspicions
which
way
did
the
woman
go
cried
don
know
sir
noticed
her
pass
but
had
no
special
reason
for
watching
her
she
seemed
to
be
in
hurry
how
long
ago
was
it
oh
not
very
many
minutes
within
the
last
vie
well
it
could
not
be
more
than
five
you
re
only
wasting
your
time
sir
and
every
minute
now
is
of
importance
cried
the
commissionnaire
take
my
word
for
it
that
my
old
woman
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
come
down
to
the
other
end
of
the
street
well
if
you
won
will
and
with
that
he
rushed
off
in
the
other
direction
but
was
after
him
in
an
instant
and
caught
him
by
the
sleeve

he
answered
but
don
let
yourself
be
drawn
away
upon
false
scent
mr
phelps
come
to
the
other
end
of
the
street
and
let
us
see
if
we
can
hear
of
anything
nothing
was
to
be
lost
by
following
his
advice
with
the
policeman
we
both
hurried
down
but
only
to
find
the
street
full
of
traffic
many
people
coming
and
going
but
all
only
too
eager
to
get
to
place
of
safety
upon
so
wet
night
there
was
no
lounger
who
could
tell
us
who
had
passed
then
we
returned
to
the
office
and
searched
the
stairs
and
the
passage
without
result
the
corridor
which
led
to
the
room
was
laid
down
with
kind
of
creamy
linoleum
which
shows
an
impression
very
easily
we
examined
it
very
carefully
but
found
no
outline
of
any
footmark
had
it
been
raining
all
evening
since
about
seven
how
is
it
then
that
the
woman
who
came
into
the
room
about
nine
left
no
traces
with
her
muddy
boots
am
glad
you
raised
the
point
it
occurred
to
me
at
the
time
the
charwomen
are
in
the
habit
of
taking
off
their
boots
at
the
commissionnaire
office
and
putting
on
list
slippers
that
is
very
clear
there
were
no
marks
then
though
the
night
was
wet
one
the
chain
of
events
is
certainly
one
of
extraordinary
interest
what
did
you
do
next
we
examined
the
room
also
there
is
no
possibility
of
secret
door
and
the
windows
are
quite
thirty
feet
from
the
ground
both
of
them
were
fastened
on
the
inside
the
carpet
prevents
any
possibility
of
trap
door
and
the
ceiling
is
of
the
ordinary
whitewashed
kind
will
pledge
my
life
that
whoever
stole
my
papers
could
only
have
come
through
the
door
how
about
the
fireplace
they
use
none
there
is
stove
the
bell
rope
hangs
from
the
wire
just
to
the
right
of
my
desk
whoever
rang
it
must
have
come
right
up
to
the
desk
to
do
it
but
why
should
any
criminal
wish
to
ring
the
bell
it
is
most
insoluble
mystery
certainly
the
incident
was
unusual
what
were
your
next
steps
you
examined
the
room
presume
to
see
if
the
intruder
had
left
any
traces
any
cigar
end
or
dropped
glove
or
hairpin
or
other
trifle
there
was
nothing
of
the
sort
no
smell
well
we
never
thought
of
that
ah
scent
of
tobacco
would
have
been
worth
great
deal
to
us
in
such
an
investigation
never
smoke
myself
so
think
should
have
observed
it
if
there
had
been
any
smell
of
tobacco
there
was
absolutely
no
clue
of
any
kind
the
only
tangible
fact
was
that
the
commissionnaire
wife
mrs
tangey
was
the
name
had
hurried
our
of
the
place
he
could
give
no
explanation
save
that
it
was
about
the
time
when
the
woman
always
went
home
the
policeman
and
agreed
that
our
best
plan
would
be
to
seize
the
woman
before
she
could
get
rid
of
the
papers
presuming
that
she
had
them
the
alarm
had
reached
scotland
yard
by
this
time
and
mr
forbes
the
detective
came
round
at
once
and
took
up
the
case
with
great
deal
of
energy
we
hire
hansom
and
in
half
an
hour
we
were
at
the
address
which
had
been
given
to
us
young
woman
opened
the
door
who
proved
to
be
mrs
tangey
eldest
daughter
her
mother
had
not
come
back
yet
and
we
were
shown
into
the
front
room
to
wait
about
ten
minutes
later
knock
came
at
the
door
and
here
we
made
the
one
serious
mistake
for
which
blame
myself
instead
of
opening
the
door
ourselves
we
allowed
the
girl
to
do
so
we
heard
her
say
mother
there
are
two
men
in
the
house
waiting
to
see
you
and
an
instant
afterwards
we
heard
the
patter
of
feet
rushing
down
the
passage
forbes
flung
open
the
door
and
we
both
ran
into
the
back
room
or
kitchen
but
the
woman
had
got
there
before
us
she
stared
at
us
with
defiant
eyes
and
then
suddenly
recognizing
me
an
expression
of
absolute
astonishment
came
over
her
face
why
if
it
isn
mr
phelps
of
the
office
she
cried
come
who
did
you
think
we
were
when
you
ran
away
from
us
asked
my
companion
thought
you
were
the
brokers
said
she
we
have
had
some
trouble
with
tradesman
that
not
quite
good
enough
answered
forbes
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
you
have
taken
paper
of
importance
fro
the
foreign
office
and
that
you
ran
in
here
to
dispose
of
it
you
must
come
back
with
us
to
scotland
yard
to
be
searched
it
was
in
vain
that
she
protested
and
resisted
four
wheeler
was
brought
and
we
all
three
drove
back
in
it
we
had
first
made
an
examination
of
the
kitchen
and
especially
of
the
kitchen
fire
to
see
whether
she
might
have
made
away
with
the
papers
during
the
instant
that
she
was
alone
there
were
no
signs
however
of
any
ashes
or
scraps
when
we
reached
scotland
yard
she
was
handed
over
at
once
to
the
female
searcher
waited
in
an
agony
of
suspense
until
she
came
back
with
her
report
there
were
no
signs
of
the
papers
then
for
the
first
time
the
horror
of
my
situation
came
in
its
full
force
hitherto
had
been
acting
and
action
had
numbed
thought
had
been
so
confident
of
regaining
the
treaty
at
once
that
had
not
dared
to
think
of
what
would
be
the
consequence
if
failed
to
do
so
but
now
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
and
had
leisure
to
realize
my
position
it
was
horrible
watson
there
would
tell
you
that
was
nervous
sensitive
boy
at
school
it
is
my
nature
thought
of
my
uncle
and
of
his
colleagues
in
the
cabinet
of
the
shame
which
had
brought
upon
him
upon
myself
upon
every
one
connected
with
me
what
though
was
the
victim
of
an
extraordinary
accident
no
allowance
is
made
for
accidents
where
diplomatic
interests
are
at
stake
was
ruined
shamefully
hopelessly
ruined
don
know
what
did
fancy
must
have
made
scene
have
dim
recollection
of
group
of
officials
who
crowded
round
me
endeavoring
to
soothe
me
one
of
them
drove
down
with
me
to
waterloo
and
saw
me
into
the
woking
train
believe
that
he
would
have
come
all
the
way
had
it
not
been
that
dr
ferrier
who
lives
near
me
was
going
down
by
that
very
train
the
doctor
most
kindly
took
charge
of
me
and
it
was
well
he
did
so
for
had
fit
in
the
station
and
before
we
reached
home
was
practically
raving
maniac
you
can
imagine
the
state
of
things
here
when
they
were
roused
from
their
beds
by
the
doctor
ringing
and
found
me
in
this
condition
poor
annie
here
and
my
mother
were
broken
hearted
dr
ferrier
had
just
heard
enough
from
the
detective
at
the
station
to
be
able
to
give
an
idea
of
what
had
happened
and
his
story
did
not
mend
matters
it
was
evident
to
all
that
was
in
for
long
illness
so
joseph
was
bundled
out
of
this
cheery
bedroom
and
it
was
turned
into
sick
room
for
me
here
have
lain
mr
holmes
for
over
nine
weeks
unconscious
and
raving
with
brain
fever
if
it
had
not
been
for
miss
harrison
here
and
for
the
doctor
care
should
not
be
speaking
to
you
now
she
has
nursed
me
by
day
and
hired
nurse
has
looked
after
me
by
night
for
in
my
mad
fits
was
capable
of
anything
slowly
my
reason
has
cleared
but
it
is
only
during
the
last
three
days
that
my
memory
has
quite
returned
sometimes
wish
that
it
never
had
the
first
thing
that
did
was
to
wire
to
mr
forbes
who
had
the
case
in
hand
he
came
out
and
assures
me
that
though
everything
has
been
done
no
trace
of
clue
has
been
discovered
the
commissionnaire
and
his
wife
have
been
examined
in
every
way
without
any
light
being
thrown
upon
the
matter
the
suspicions
of
the
police
then
rested
upon
young
gorot
who
as
you
may
remember
stayed
over
time
in
the
office
that
night
his
remaining
behind
and
is
french
name
were
really
the
only
two
points
which
could
suggest
suspicion
but
as
matter
of
fact
did
not
begin
work
until
he
had
gone
and
his
people
are
of
huguenot
extraction
but
as
english
in
sympathy
and
tradition
as
you
and
are
nothing
was
found
to
implicate
him
in
any
way
and
there
the
matter
dropped
turn
to
you
mr
holmes
as
absolutely
my
last
hope
if
you
fail
me
then
my
honour
as
well
as
my
position
are
forever
forfeited
the
invalid
sank
back
upon
his
cushions
tired
out
by
this
long
recital
while
his
nurse
poured
him
out
glass
of
some
stimulating
medicine
holmes
sat
silently
with
his
head
thrown
back
and
his
eyes
closed
in
an
attitude
which
might
seem
listless
to
stranger
but
which
knew
betokened
the
most
intense
self
absorption
you
statement
has
been
so
explicit
said
he
at
last
that
you
have
really
left
me
very
few
questions
to
ask
there
is
one
of
the
very
utmost
importance
however
did
you
tell
any
one
that
you
had
this
special
task
to
perform
no
one
not
miss
harrison
here
for
example
no
had
not
been
back
to
woking
between
getting
the
order
and
executing
the
commission
and
none
of
your
people
had
by
chance
been
to
see
you
none
did
any
of
them
know
their
way
about
in
the
office
oh
yes
all
of
them
had
been
shown
over
it
still
of
course
if
you
said
nothing
to
any
one
about
the
treaty
these
inquiries
are
irrelevant

said
nothing
do
you
know
anything
of
the
commissionnaire
nothing
except
that
he
is
an
old
soldier
what
regiment
oh
have
heard
coldstream
guards
thank
you
have
no
doubt
can
get
details
from
forbes
the
authorities
are
excellent
at
amassing
facts
though
they
do
not
always
use
them
to
advantage
what
lovely
thing
rose
is
he
walked
past
the
couch
to
the
open
window
and
held
up
the
drooping
stalk
of
moss
rose
looking
down
at
the
dainty
blend
of
crimson
and
green
it
was
new
phase
of
his
character
to
me
for
had
never
before
seen
him
show
any
keen
interest
in
natural
objects
there
is
nothing
in
which
deduction
is
so
necessary
as
in
religion
said
he
leaning
with
his
back
against
the
shutters
it
can
be
built
up
as
an
exact
science
by
the
reasoner
our
highest
assurance
of
the
goodness
of
providence
seems
to
me
to
rest
in
the
flowers
all
other
things
our
powers
our
desires
our
food
are
all
really
necessary
for
our
existence
in
the
first
instance
but
this
rose
is
an
extra
its
smell
and
its
colour
are
an
embellishment
of
life
not
condition
of
it
is
only
goodness
which
gives
extras
and
so
say
again
that
we
have
much
to
hope
from
the
flowers
percy
phelps
and
his
nurse
looked
at
holmes
during
this
demonstration
with
surprise
and
good
deal
of
disappointment
written
upon
their
faces
he
had
fallen
into
reverie
with
the
moss
rose
between
his
fingers
it
had
lasted
some
minutes
before
the
young
lady
broke
in
upon
it
do
you
see
any
prospect
of
solving
this
mystery
mr
holmes
she
asked
with
touch
of
asperity
in
her
voice
oh
the
mystery
he
answered
coming
back
with
start
to
the
realities
of
life
well
it
would
be
absurd
to
deny
that
the
case
is
very
abstruse
and
complicated
one
but
can
promise
you
that
will
look
into
the
matter
and
let
you
know
any
points
which
may
strike
me
do
you
see
any
clue
you
have
furnished
me
with
seven
but
of
course
must
test
them
before
can
pronounce
upon
their
value
you
suspect
some
one
suspect
myself
what
of
coming
to
conclusions
to
rapidly
then
go
to
london
and
test
your
conclusions
your
advice
is
very
excellent
miss
harrison
said
holmes
rising
think
watson
we
cannot
do
better
do
not
allow
yourself
to
indulge
in
false
hopes
mr
phelps
the
affair
is
very
tangled
one
shall
be
in
fever
until
see
you
again
cried
the
diplomatist
well
ll
come
out
be
the
same
train
to
morrow
though
it
more
than
likely
that
my
report
will
be
negative
one
god
bless
you
for
promising
to
come
cried
our
client
it
gives
me
fresh
life
to
know
that
something
is
being
done
by
the
way
have
had
letter
from
lord
holdhurst
ha
what
did
he
say
he
was
cold
but
not
harsh
dare
say
my
severe
illness
prevented
him
from
being
that
he
repeated
that
the
matter
was
of
the
utmost
importance
and
added
that
no
steps
would
be
taken
about
my
future
by
which
he
means
of
course
my
dismissal
until
my
health
was
restored
and
had
an
opportunity
of
repairing
my
misfortune
well
that
was
reasonable
and
considerate
said
holmes
come
watson
for
we
have
goody
day
work
before
us
in
town
mr
joseph
harrison
drove
us
down
to
the
station
and
we
were
soon
whirling
up
in
portsmouth
train
holmes
was
sunk
in
profound
thought
and
hardly
opened
his
mouth
until
we
had
passed
clapham
junction
it
very
cheery
thing
to
come
into
london
by
any
of
these
lines
which
run
high
and
allow
you
to
look
down
upon
the
houses
like
this
thought
he
was
joking
for
the
view
was
sordid
enough
but
he
soon
explained
himself
look
at
those
big
isolated
clumps
of
building
rising
up
above
the
slates
like
brick
islands
in
lead
coloured
sea
the
board
schools
light
houses
my
boy
beacons
of
the
future
capsules
with
hundreds
of
bright
little
seeds
in
each
out
of
which
will
spring
the
wise
better
england
of
the
future
suppose
that
man
phelps
does
not
drink
should
not
think
so
nor
should
but
we
are
bound
to
take
every
possibility
into
account
the
poor
devil
has
certainly
got
himself
into
very
deep
water
and
it
question
whether
we
shall
ever
be
able
to
get
him
ashore
what
did
you
think
of
miss
harrison
girl
of
strong
character
yes
but
she
is
good
sort
or
am
mistaken
she
and
her
brother
are
the
only
children
of
an
iron
master
somewhere
up
northumberland
way
he
got
engaged
to
her
when
traveling
last
winter
and
she
came
down
to
be
introduced
to
his
people
with
her
brother
as
escort
then
came
the
smash
and
she
stayed
on
to
nurse
her
lover
while
brother
joseph
finding
himself
pretty
snug
stayed
on
too
ve
been
making
few
independent
inquiries
you
see
but
to
day
must
be
day
of
inquiries
my
practice—
began
oh
if
you
find
your
own
cases
more
interesting
than
mine—
said
holmes
with
some
asperity
was
going
to
say
that
my
practice
could
get
along
very
well
for
day
or
two
since
it
is
the
slackest
time
in
the
year
excellent
said
he
recovering
his
good
humor
then
we
ll
look
into
this
matter
together
think
that
we
should
begin
be
seeing
forbes
he
can
probably
tell
us
all
the
details
we
want
until
we
know
from
what
side
the
case
is
to
be
approached
you
said
you
had
clue
well
we
have
several
but
we
can
only
test
their
value
by
further
inquiry
the
most
difficult
crime
to
track
is
the
one
which
is
purposeless
now
this
is
not
purposeless
who
is
it
who
profits
by
it
there
is
the
french
ambassador
there
is
the
russian
there
is
who
ever
might
sell
it
to
either
of
these
and
there
is
lord
holdhurst
lord
holdhurst
well
it
is
just
conceivable
that
statesman
might
find
himself
in
position
where
he
was
not
sorry
to
have
such
document
accidentally
destroyed
not
statesman
wit
the
honourable
record
of
lord
holdhurst
it
is
possibility
and
we
cannot
afford
to
disregard
it
we
shall
see
the
noble
lord
to
day
and
find
out
if
he
can
tell
us
anything
meanwhile
have
already
set
inquiries
on
foot
already
yes
sent
wires
from
woking
station
to
every
evening
paper
in
london
this
advertisement
will
appear
in
each
of
them
he
handed
over
sheet
torn
from
note
book
on
it
was
scribbled
in
pencil
£10
reward
the
number
of
the
cab
which
dropped
fare
at
or
about
the
door
of
the
foreign
office
in
charles
street
at
quarter
to
ten
in
the
evening
of
may
23d
apply
221
baker
street
you
are
confident
that
the
thief
came
in
cab
if
not
there
is
no
harm
done
but
if
mr
phelps
is
correct
in
stating
that
there
is
no
hiding
place
either
in
the
room
or
the
corridors
then
the
person
must
have
come
from
outside
if
he
came
from
outside
on
so
wet
night
and
yet
left
no
trace
of
damp
upon
the
linoleum
which
was
examined
within
few
minutes
of
his
passing
then
it
is
exceeding
probably
that
he
came
in
cab
yes
think
that
we
may
safely
deduce
cab
it
sounds
plausible
that
is
one
of
the
clues
of
which
spoke
it
may
lead
us
to
something
and
then
of
course
there
is
the
bell
which
is
the
most
distinctive
feature
of
the
case
why
should
the
bell
ring
was
it
the
thief
who
did
it
out
of
bravado
or
was
it
some
one
who
was
with
the
thief
who
did
it
in
order
to
prevent
the
crime
or
was
it
an
accident
or
was
it—
he
sank
back
into
the
state
of
intense
and
silent
thought
from
which
he
had
emerged
but
it
seemed
to
me
accustomed
as
was
to
his
every
mood
that
some
new
possibility
had
dawned
suddenly
upon
him
it
was
twenty
past
three
when
we
reached
our
terminus
and
after
hasty
luncheon
at
the
buffet
we
pushed
on
at
once
to
scotland
yard
holmes
had
already
wired
to
forbes
and
we
found
him
waiting
to
receive
us
small
foxy
man
with
sharp
but
by
no
means
amiable
expression
he
was
decidedly
frigid
in
his
manner
to
us
especially
when
he
heard
the
errand
upon
which
we
had
come
ve
heard
of
your
methods
before
now
mr
holmes
said
he
tartly
you
are
ready
enough
to
use
all
the
information
that
the
police
can
lay
at
your
disposal
and
then
you
try
to
finish
the
case
yourself
and
bring
discredit
on
them
on
the
contrary
said
holmes
out
of
my
last
fifty
three
cases
my
name
has
only
appeared
in
four
and
the
police
have
had
all
the
credit
in
forty
nine
don
blame
you
for
not
knowing
this
for
you
are
young
and
inexperienced
but
if
you
wish
to
get
on
in
your
new
duties
you
will
work
with
me
and
not
against
me
be
very
glad
of
hint
or
two
said
the
detective
changing
his
manner
ve
certainly
had
no
credit
from
the
case
so
far
what
steps
have
you
taken
tangey
the
commissionnaire
has
been
shadowed
he
left
the
guards
with
good
character
and
we
can
find
nothing
against
him
his
wife
is
bad
lot
though
fancy
she
knows
more
about
this
than
appears

have
you
shadowed
her
we
have
set
one
of
our
women
on
to
her
mrs
tangey
drinks
and
our
woman
has
been
with
her
twice
when
she
was
well
on
but
she
could
get
nothing
out
of
her
understand
that
they
have
had
brokers
in
the
house
yes
but
they
were
paid
off
where
did
the
money
come
from
that
was
all
right
his
pension
was
due
they
have
not
shown
any
sign
of
being
in
funds
what
explanation
did
she
give
of
having
answered
the
bell
when
mr
phelps
rang
for
the
coffee
she
said
that
he
husband
was
very
tired
and
she
wished
to
relieve
him
well
certainly
that
would
agree
with
his
being
found
little
later
asleep
in
his
chair
there
is
nothing
against
them
then
but
the
woman
character
did
you
ask
her
why
she
hurried
away
that
night
her
haste
attracted
the
attention
of
the
police
constable
she
was
later
than
usual
and
wanted
to
get
home
did
you
point
out
to
her
that
you
and
mr
phelps
who
started
at
least
twenty
minutes
after
he
got
home
before
her
she
explains
that
by
the
difference
between
bus
and
hansom
did
she
make
it
clear
why
on
reaching
her
house
she
ran
into
the
back
kitchen
because
she
had
the
money
there
with
which
to
pay
off
the
brokers
she
has
at
least
an
answer
for
everything
did
you
ask
her
whether
in
leaving
she
met
any
one
or
saw
any
one
loitering
about
charles
street
she
saw
no
one
but
the
constable
well
you
seem
to
have
cross
examined
her
pretty
thoroughly
what
else
have
you
done
the
clerk
gorot
has
been
shadowed
all
these
nine
weeks
but
without
result
we
can
show
nothing
against
him
anything
else
well
we
have
nothing
else
to
go
upon
no
evidence
of
any
kind
have
you
formed
theory
about
how
that
bell
rang
well
must
confess
that
it
beats
me
it
was
cool
hand
whoever
it
was
to
go
and
give
the
alarm
like
that
yes
it
was
queer
thing
to
do
many
thanks
to
you
for
what
you
have
told
me
if
can
put
the
man
into
your
hands
you
shall
hear
from
me
come
along
watson
where
are
we
going
to
now
asked
as
we
left
the
office
we
are
now
going
to
interview
lord
holdhurst
the
cabinet
minister
and
future
premier
of
england
we
were
fortunate
in
finding
that
lord
holdhurst
was
still
in
his
chambers
in
downing
street
and
on
holmes
sending
in
his
card
we
were
instantly
shown
up
the
statesman
received
us
with
that
old
fashioned
courtesy
for
which
he
is
remarkable
and
seated
us
on
the
two
luxuriant
lounges
on
either
side
of
the
fireplace
standing
on
the
run
between
us
with
his
slight
tall
figure
his
sharp
features
thoughtful
face
and
curling
hair
prematurely
tinged
with
grey
he
seemed
to
represent
that
not
to
common
type
nobleman
who
is
in
truth
noble
you
name
is
very
familiar
to
me
mr
holmes
said
he
smiling
and
of
course
cannot
pretend
to
be
ignorant
of
the
object
of
your
visit
there
has
only
been
once
occurrence
in
these
offices
which
could
call
for
your
attention
in
whose
interest
are
you
acting
may
ask
in
that
of
mr
percy
phelps
answered
holmes
ah
my
unfortunate
nephew
you
can
understand
that
our
kinship
makes
it
the
more
impossible
for
me
to
screen
him
in
any
way
fear
that
the
incident
must
have
very
prejudicial
effect
upon
his
career
but
if
the
document
if
found
ah
that
of
course
would
be
different
had
one
or
two
questions
which
wished
to
ask
you
lord
holdhurst
shall
be
happy
to
give
you
any
information
in
my
power
was
it
in
this
room
that
you
gave
your
instructions
as
to
the
copying
of
the
document
it
was
then
you
could
hardly
have
been
overheard
it
is
out
of
the
question
did
you
ever
mention
to
any
one
that
it
was
your
intention
to
give
any
one
the
treaty
to
be
copied
never
you
are
certain
of
that
absolutely
well
since
you
never
said
so
and
mr
phelps
never
said
so
and
nobody
else
knew
anything
of
the
matter
then
the
thief
presence
in
the
room
was
purely
accidental
he
saw
his
chance
and
he
took
it
the
statesman
smiled
you
take
me
out
of
my
province
there
said
he
holmes
considered
for
moment
there
is
another
very
important
point
which
wish
to
discuss
with
you
said
he
you
feared
as
understand
that
very
grave
results
might
follow
from
the
details
of
this
treaty
becoming
known
shadow
passed
over
the
expressive
face
of
the
statesman
very
grave
results
indeed
any
have
they
occurred
not
yet
if
the
treaty
had
reached
let
us
say
the
french
or
russian
foreign
office
you
would
expect
to
hear
of
it
should
said
lord
holdhurst
with
wry
face
since
nearly
ten
weeks
have
elapsed
then
and
nothing
has
been
heard
it
is
not
unfair
to
suppose
that
for
some
reason
the
treaty
has
not
reached
them
lord
holdhurst
shrugged
his
shoulders
we
can
hardly
suppose
mr
holmes
that
the
thief
took
the
treaty
in
order
to
frame
it
and
hang
it
up
perhaps
he
is
waiting
for
better
price
if
he
waits
little
longer
he
will
get
no
price
at
all
the
treaty
will
cease
to
be
secret
in
few
months
that
is
most
important
said
holmes
of
course
it
is
possible
supposition
that
the
thief
has
had
sudden
illness—
an
attack
of
brain
fever
for
example
asked
the
statesman
flashing
swift
glance
at
him
did
not
say
so
said
holmes
imperturbably
and
now
lord
holdhurst
we
have
already
taken
up
too
much
of
your
valuable
time
and
we
shall
wish
you
good
day
every
success
to
your
investigation
be
the
criminal
who
it
may
answered
the
nobleman
as
he
bowed
us
out
the
door
he
fine
fellow
said
holmes
as
we
came
out
into
whitehall
but
he
has
struggle
to
keep
up
his
position
he
is
far
from
rich
and
has
many
calls
you
noticed
of
course
that
his
boots
had
been
resoled
now
watson
won
detain
you
from
your
legitimate
work
any
longer
shall
do
nothing
more
to
day
unless
have
an
answer
to
my
cab
advertisement
but
should
be
extremely
obliged
to
you
if
you
would
come
down
with
me
to
woking
to
morrow
by
the
same
train
which
we
took
yesterday
met
him
accordingly
next
morning
and
we
traveled
down
to
woking
together
he
had
no
answer
to
his
advertisement
he
said
and
no
fresh
light
had
been
thrown
upon
the
case
he
had
when
he
so
willed
it
the
utter
immobility
of
countenance
of
red
indian
and
could
not
gather
from
his
appearance
whether
he
was
satisfied
or
not
with
the
position
of
the
case
his
conversation
remember
was
about
the
bertillon
system
of
measurements
and
he
expressed
his
enthusiastic
admiration
of
the
french
savant
we
found
our
client
still
under
the
charge
of
his
devoted
nurse
but
looking
considerably
better
than
before
he
rose
from
the
sofa
and
greeted
us
without
difficulty
when
we
entered
any
news
he
asked
eagerly
my
report
as
expected
is
negative
one
said
holmes
have
seen
forbes
and
have
seen
your
uncle
and
have
set
one
or
two
trains
of
inquiry
upon
foot
which
may
lead
to
something
you
have
not
lost
heart
then
by
no
means
god
bless
you
for
saying
that
cried
miss
harrison
if
we
keep
our
courage
and
our
patience
the
truth
must
come
out
we
have
more
to
tell
you
than
you
have
for
us
said
phelps
reseating
himself
upon
the
couch
hoped
you
might
have
something
yes
we
have
had
an
adventure
during
the
night
and
one
which
might
have
proved
to
be
serious
one
his
expression
grew
very
grave
as
he
spoke
and
look
of
something
akin
to
fear
sprang
up
in
his
eyes
do
you
know
said
he
that
begin
to
believe
that
am
the
unconscious
centre
of
some
monstrous
conspiracy
and
that
my
life
is
aimed
at
as
well
as
my
honour
ah
cried
holmes
it
sounds
incredible
for
have
not
as
far
as
know
an
enemy
in
the
world
yet
from
last
night
experience
can
come
to
no
other
conclusion
pray
let
me
hear
it
you
must
know
that
last
night
was
the
very
first
night
that
have
ever
slept
without
nurse
in
the
room
was
so
much
better
that
thought
could
dispense
with
one
had
night
light
burning
however
well
about
two
in
the
morning
had
sunk
into
light
sleep
when
was
suddenly
aroused
by
slight
noise
it
was
like
the
sound
which
mouse
makes
when
it
is
gnawing
plank
and
lay
listening
to
it
for
some
time
under
the
impression
that
it
must
come
from
that
cause
then
it
grew
louder
and
suddenly
there
came
from
the
window
sharp
metallic
snick
sat
up
in
amazement
there
could
be
no
doubt
what
the
sounds
were
now
the
first
ones
had
been
caused
by
some
one
forcing
an
instrument
through
the
slit
between
the
sashes
and
the
second
by
the
catch
being
pressed
back

there
was
pause
then
for
about
ten
minutes
as
if
the
person
were
waiting
to
see
whether
the
noise
had
awakened
me
then
heard
gentle
creaking
as
the
window
was
very
slowly
opened
could
stand
it
no
longer
for
my
nerves
are
not
what
they
used
to
be
sprang
out
of
bed
and
flung
open
the
shutters
man
was
crouching
at
the
window
could
see
little
of
him
for
he
was
gone
like
flash
he
was
wrapped
in
some
sort
of
cloak
which
came
across
the
lower
part
of
his
face
one
thing
only
am
sure
of
and
that
is
that
he
had
some
weapon
in
his
hand
it
looked
to
me
like
long
knife
distinctly
saw
the
gleam
of
it
as
he
turned
to
run
this
is
most
interesting
said
holmes
pray
what
did
you
do
then
should
have
followed
him
through
the
open
window
if
had
been
stronger
as
it
was
rang
the
bell
and
roused
the
house
it
took
me
some
little
time
for
the
bell
rings
in
the
kitchen
and
the
servants
all
sleep
upstairs
shouted
however
and
that
brought
joseph
down
and
he
roused
the
others
joseph
and
the
groom
found
marks
on
the
bed
outside
the
window
but
the
weather
has
been
so
dry
lately
that
they
found
it
hopeless
to
follow
the
trail
across
the
grass
there
place
however
on
the
wooden
fence
which
skirts
the
road
which
shows
signs
they
tell
me
as
if
some
one
had
got
over
and
had
snapped
the
top
of
the
rail
in
doing
so
have
said
nothing
to
the
local
police
yet
for
thought
had
best
have
your
opinion
first
this
tale
of
our
client
appeared
to
have
an
extraordinary
effect
upon
sherlock
holmes
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
paced
about
the
room
in
uncontrollable
excitement
misfortunes
never
come
single
said
phelps
smiling
though
it
was
evident
that
his
adventure
had
somewhat
shaken
him
you
have
certainly
had
your
share
said
holmes
do
you
think
you
could
walk
round
the
house
with
me
oh
yes
should
like
little
sunshine
joseph
will
come
too
and
also
said
miss
harrison
am
afraid
not
said
holmes
shaking
his
head
think
must
ask
you
to
remain
sitting
exactly
where
you
are
the
young
lady
resumed
her
seat
with
an
air
of
displeasure
her
brother
however
had
joined
us
and
we
set
off
all
four
together
we
passed
round
the
lawn
to
the
outside
of
the
young
diplomatist
window
there
were
as
he
had
said
marks
upon
the
bed
but
they
were
hopelessly
blurred
and
vague
holmes
stopped
over
them
for
an
instant
and
then
rose
shrugging
his
shoulders
don
think
any
one
could
make
much
of
this
said
he
let
us
go
round
the
house
and
see
why
this
particular
room
was
chose
by
the
burglar
should
have
thought
those
larger
windows
of
the
drawing
room
and
dining
room
would
have
had
more
attractions
for
him
they
are
more
visible
from
the
road
suggested
mr
joseph
harrison
ah
yes
of
course
there
is
door
here
which
he
might
have
attempted
what
is
it
for
it
is
the
side
entrance
for
trades
people
of
course
it
is
locked
at
night
have
you
ever
had
an
alarm
like
this
before
never
said
our
client
do
you
keep
plate
in
the
house
or
anything
to
attract
burglars
nothing
of
value
holmes
strolled
round
the
house
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
negligent
air
which
was
unusual
with
him
by
the
way
said
he
to
joseph
harrison
you
found
some
place
understand
where
the
fellow
scaled
the
fence
let
us
have
look
at
that
the
plump
young
man
led
us
to
spot
where
the
top
of
one
of
the
wooden
rails
had
been
cracked
small
fragment
of
the
wood
was
hanging
down
holmes
pulled
it
off
and
examined
it
critically
do
you
think
that
was
done
last
night
it
looks
rather
old
does
it
not
well
possibly
so
there
are
no
marks
of
any
one
jumping
down
upon
the
other
side
no
fancy
we
shall
get
no
help
here
let
us
go
back
to
the
bedroom
and
talk
the
matter
over
percy
phelps
was
walking
very
slowly
leaning
upon
the
arm
of
his
future
brother
in
law
holmes
walked
swiftly
across
the
lawn
and
we
were
at
the
open
window
of
the
bedroom
long
before
the
others
came
up
miss
harrison
said
holmes
speaking
with
the
utmost
intensity
of
manner
you
must
stay
where
you
are
all
day
let
nothing
prevent
you
from
staying
where
you
are
all
day
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
certainly
if
you
wish
it
mr
holmes
said
the
girl
in
astonishment
when
you
go
to
bed
lock
the
door
of
this
room
on
the
outside
and
keep
the
key
promise
to
do
this
but
percy
he
will
come
to
london
with
us
and
am
to
remain
here
it
is
for
his
sake
you
can
serve
him
quick
promise
she
gave
quick
nod
of
assent
just
as
the
other
two
came
up
why
do
you
sit
moping
there
annie
cried
her
brother
come
out
into
the
sunshine
no
thank
you
joseph
have
slight
headache
and
this
room
is
deliciously
cool
and
soothing
what
do
you
propose
now
mr
holmes
asked
our
client
well
in
investigating
this
minor
affair
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
our
main
inquiry
it
would
be
very
great
help
to
me
if
you
would
come
up
to
london
with
us
at
once
well
as
soon
as
you
conveniently
can
say
in
an
hour
feel
quite
strong
enough
if
can
really
be
of
any
help
the
greatest
possible
perhaps
you
would
like
me
the
stay
there
to
night
was
just
going
to
propose
it
then
if
my
friend
of
the
night
comes
to
revisit
me
he
will
find
the
bird
flown
we
are
all
in
your
hands
mr
holmes
and
you
must
tell
us
exactly
what
you
would
like
done
perhaps
you
would
prefer
that
joseph
came
wit
us
so
as
to
look
after
me
oh
no
my
friend
watson
is
medical
man
you
know
and
he
ll
look
after
you
we
ll
have
our
lunch
here
if
you
will
permit
us
and
then
we
shall
al
three
set
off
for
town
together
it
was
arranged
as
he
suggested
though
miss
harrison
excused
herself
from
leaving
the
bedroom
in
accordance
with
holmes
suggestion
what
the
object
of
my
friend
manoeuvres
was
could
not
conceive
unless
it
were
to
keep
the
lady
away
from
phelps
who
rejoiced
by
his
returning
health
and
by
the
prospect
of
action
lunched
with
us
in
the
dining
room
holmes
had
still
more
startling
surprise
for
us
however
for
after
accompanying
us
down
to
the
station
and
seeing
us
into
our
carriage
he
calmly
announced
that
he
had
no
intention
of
leaving
woking
there
are
one
or
two
small
points
which
should
desire
to
clear
up
before
go
said
he
your
absence
mr
phelps
will
in
some
ways
rather
assist
me
watson
when
you
reach
london
you
would
oblige
me
by
driving
at
once
to
baker
street
with
our
friend
here
and
remaining
with
him
until
see
you
again
it
is
fortunate
that
you
are
old
school
fellows
as
you
must
have
much
to
talk
over
mr
phelps
can
have
the
spare
bedroom
to
night
and
will
be
with
you
in
time
for
breakfast
for
there
is
train
which
will
take
me
into
waterloo
at
eight
but
how
about
our
investigation
in
london
asked
phelps
ruefully
we
can
do
that
to
morrow
think
that
just
at
present
can
be
of
more
immediate
use
here
you
might
tell
them
at
briarbrae
that
hope
to
be
back
to
morrow
night
cried
phelps
as
we
began
to
move
from
the
platform
hardly
expect
to
go
back
to
briarbrae
answered
holmes
and
waved
his
hand
to
us
cheerily
as
we
shot
out
from
the
station
phelps
and
talked
it
over
on
our
journey
but
neither
of
us
could
devise
satisfactory
reason
for
this
new
development
suppose
he
wants
to
find
out
some
clue
as
to
the
burglary
last
night
if
burglar
it
was
for
myself
don
believe
it
was
an
ordinary
thief
what
is
your
own
idea
then
upon
my
word
you
may
put
it
down
to
my
weak
nerves
or
not
but
believe
there
is
some
deep
political
intrigue
going
on
around
me
and
that
for
some
reason
that
passes
my
understanding
my
life
is
aimed
at
by
the
conspirators
it
sounds
high
flown
and
absurd
but
consider
the
fats
why
should
thief
try
to
break
in
at
bedroom
window
where
there
could
be
no
hope
of
any
plunder
and
why
should
he
come
with
long
knife
in
his
hand
you
are
sure
it
was
not
house
breaker
jimmy
oh
no
it
was
knife
saw
the
flash
of
the
blade
quite
distinctly
but
why
on
earth
should
you
be
pursued
with
such
animosity
ah
that
is
the
question
well
if
holmes
takes
the
same
view
that
would
account
for
his
action
would
it
not
presuming
that
your
theory
is
correct
if
he
can
lay
his
hands
upon
the
man
who
threatened
you
last
night
he
will
have
gone
long
way
towards
finding
who
took
the
naval
treaty
it
is
absurd
to
suppose
that
you
have
two
enemies
one
of
whom
robs
you
while
the
other
threatens
your
life
but
holmes
said
that
he
was
not
going
to
briarbrae
have
known
him
for
some
time
said
but
never
knew
him
do
anything
yet
without
very
good
reason
and
with
that
our
conversation
drifted
off
on
to
other
topics

but
it
was
weary
day
for
me
phelps
was
still
weak
after
his
long
illness
and
his
misfortune
made
him
querulous
and
nervous
in
vain
endeavored
to
interest
him
in
afghanistan
in
india
in
social
questions
in
anything
which
might
take
his
mind
out
of
the
groove
he
would
always
come
back
to
his
lost
treaty
wondering
guessing
speculating
as
to
what
holmes
was
doing
what
steps
lord
holdhurst
was
taking
what
news
we
should
have
in
the
morning
as
the
evening
wore
on
his
excitement
became
quite
painful
you
have
implicit
faith
in
holmes
he
asked
have
seen
him
do
some
remarkable
things
but
he
never
brought
light
into
anything
quite
so
dark
as
this
oh
yes
have
known
him
solve
questions
which
presented
fewer
clues
than
yours
but
not
where
such
large
interests
are
at
stake
don
know
that
to
my
certain
knowledge
he
has
acted
on
behalf
of
three
of
the
reigning
houses
of
europe
in
very
vital
matters
but
you
know
him
well
watson
he
is
such
an
inscrutable
fellow
that
never
quite
know
what
to
make
of
him
do
you
think
he
is
hopeful
do
you
think
he
expects
to
make
success
of
it
he
has
said
nothing
that
is
bad
sign
on
the
contrary
have
noticed
that
when
he
is
off
the
trail
he
generally
says
so
it
is
when
he
is
on
scent
and
is
not
quite
absolutely
sure
yet
that
it
is
the
right
one
that
he
is
most
taciturn
now
my
dear
fellow
we
can
help
matter
by
making
ourselves
nervous
about
them
so
let
me
implore
you
to
go
to
bed
and
so
be
fresh
for
whatever
may
await
us
to
morrow
was
able
at
last
to
persuade
my
companion
to
take
my
advice
though
knew
from
his
excited
manner
that
there
was
not
much
hope
of
sleep
for
him
indeed
his
mood
was
infectious
for
lay
tossing
half
the
night
myself
brooding
over
this
strange
problem
and
inventing
hundred
theories
each
of
which
was
more
impossible
than
the
last
why
had
holmes
remained
at
woking
why
had
he
asked
miss
harrison
to
remain
in
the
sick
room
all
day
why
had
he
been
so
careful
not
to
inform
the
people
at
briarbrae
that
he
intended
to
remain
near
them
cudgelled
my
brains
until
fell
asleep
in
the
endeavor
to
find
some
explanation
which
would
cover
all
these
facts
it
was
seven
clock
when
awoke
and
set
off
at
once
for
phelps
room
to
find
him
haggard
and
spent
after
sleepless
night
his
first
question
was
whether
holmes
had
arrived
yet
he
ll
be
here
when
he
promised
said
and
not
an
instant
sooner
or
later
and
my
words
were
true
for
shortly
after
eight
hansom
dashed
up
to
the
door
and
our
friend
got
out
of
it
standing
in
the
window
we
saw
that
his
left
hand
was
swathed
in
bandage
and
that
his
face
was
very
grim
and
pale
he
entered
the
house
but
it
was
some
little
time
before
he
came
upstairs
he
looks
like
beaten
man
cried
phelps
was
forced
to
confess
that
he
was
right
after
all
said
the
clue
of
the
matter
lies
probably
here
in
town
phelps
gave
groan
don
know
how
it
is
said
he
but
had
hoped
for
so
much
from
his
return
but
surely
his
hand
was
not
tied
up
like
that
yesterday
what
can
be
the
matter
you
are
not
wounded
holmes
asked
as
my
friend
entered
the
room
tut
it
is
only
scratch
through
my
own
clumsiness
he
answered
nodding
his
good
mornings
to
us
this
case
of
yours
mr
phelps
is
certainly
one
of
the
darkest
which
have
ever
investigated
feared
that
you
would
find
it
beyond
you
it
has
been
most
remarkable
experience
that
bandage
tells
of
adventures
said
won
you
tell
us
what
has
happened
after
breakfast
my
dear
watson
remember
that
have
breathed
thirty
mile
of
surrey
air
this
morning
suppose
that
there
has
been
no
answer
from
my
cabman
advertisement
well
we
cannot
expect
to
score
every
time
the
table
was
all
laid
and
just
as
was
about
to
ring
mrs
hudson
entered
wit
the
tea
and
coffee
few
minutes
later
she
brought
in
three
covers
and
we
all
drew
up
to
the
table
holmes
ravenous
curious
and
phelps
in
the
gloomiest
state
of
depression
mrs
hudson
has
risen
to
the
occasion
said
holmes
uncovering
dish
of
curried
chicken
her
cuisine
is
little
limited
but
she
has
as
good
an
idea
of
breakfast
as
scotch
woman
what
have
you
here
watson
ham
and
eggs
answered
good
what
are
you
going
to
take
mr
phelps
curried
fowl
or
eggs
or
will
you
help
yourself
thank
you
can
eat
nothing
said
phelps
oh
come
try
the
dish
before
you
thank
you
would
really
rather
not
well
then
said
holmes
with
mischievous
twinkle
suppose
that
you
have
no
objection
to
helping
me
phelps
raised
the
cover
and
as
hi
did
so
he
uttered
scream
and
sat
there
staring
with
face
as
white
as
the
plate
upon
which
he
looked
across
the
centre
of
it
was
lying
little
cylinder
of
blue
grey
paper
he
caught
it
up
devoured
it
with
his
eyes
and
then
danced
madly
about
the
room
passing
it
to
his
bosom
and
shrieking
out
in
his
delight
then
he
fell
back
into
an
arm
chair
so
limp
and
exhausted
with
his
own
emotions
that
we
had
to
pour
brandy
down
his
throat
to
keep
him
from
fainting
there
said
holmes
soothing
patting
him
upon
the
shoulder
it
was
too
bad
to
spring
it
on
you
like
this
but
watson
here
will
tell
you
that
never
can
resist
touch
of
the
dramatic
phelps
seized
his
hand
and
kissed
it
god
bless
you
he
cried
you
have
saved
my
honour
well
my
own
was
at
stake
you
know
said
holmes
assure
you
it
is
just
as
hateful
to
me
to
fail
in
case
as
it
can
be
to
you
to
blunder
over
commission
phelps
thrust
away
the
precious
document
into
the
innermost
pocket
of
his
coat
have
not
the
heart
to
interrupt
your
breakfast
any
further
and
yet
am
dying
to
know
how
you
got
it
and
where
it
was
sherlock
holmes
swallowed
cup
of
coffee
and
turned
his
attention
to
the
ham
and
eggs
then
he
rose
lit
his
pipe
and
settled
himself
down
into
his
chair
ll
tell
you
what
did
first
and
how
came
to
do
it
afterwards
said
he
after
leaving
you
at
the
station
went
for
charming
walk
through
some
admirable
surrey
scenery
to
pretty
little
village
called
ripley
where
had
my
tea
at
an
inn
and
took
the
precaution
of
filling
my
flask
and
of
putting
paper
of
sandwiches
in
my
pocket
there
remained
until
evening
when
set
off
for
woking
again
and
found
myself
in
the
high
road
outside
briarbrae
just
after
sunset
well
waited
until
the
road
was
clear
it
is
never
very
frequented
one
at
any
time
fancy
and
then
clambered
over
the
fence
into
the
grounds
surely
the
gate
was
open
ejaculated
phelps
yes
but
have
peculiar
taste
in
these
matters
chose
the
place
where
the
three
fir
trees
stand
and
behind
their
screen
got
over
without
the
least
chance
of
any
one
in
the
house
being
able
to
see
me
crouched
down
among
the
bushes
on
the
other
side
and
crawled
from
one
to
the
other
witness
the
disreputable
state
of
my
trouser
knees
until
had
reached
the
clump
of
rhododendrons
just
opposite
to
your
bedroom
window
there
squatted
down
and
awaited
developments
the
blind
was
not
down
in
your
room
and
could
see
miss
harrison
sitting
there
reading
by
the
table
it
was
quarter
past
ten
when
she
closed
her
book
fastened
the
shutters
and
retired
heard
her
shut
the
door
and
felt
quite
sure
that
she
had
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
the
key
ejaculated
phelps
yes
had
given
miss
harrison
instructions
to
lock
the
door
on
the
outside
and
take
the
key
with
her
when
she
went
to
bed
she
carried
out
every
one
of
my
injunctions
to
the
letter
and
certainly
without
her
cooperation
you
would
not
have
that
paper
in
you
coat
pocket
she
departed
then
and
the
lights
went
out
and
was
left
squatting
in
the
rhododendron
bush
the
night
was
fine
but
still
it
was
very
weary
vigil
of
course
it
has
the
sort
of
excitement
about
it
that
the
sportsman
feels
when
he
lies
beside
the
water
course
and
waits
for
the
big
game
it
was
very
long
though
almost
as
long
watson
as
when
you
and
waited
in
that
deadly
room
when
we
looked
into
the
little
problem
of
the
speckled
band
there
was
church
clock
down
at
woking
which
struck
the
quarters
and
thought
more
than
once
that
it
had
stopped
at
last
however
about
two
in
the
morning
suddenly
heard
the
gentle
sound
of
bolt
being
pushed
back
and
the
creaking
of
key
moment
later
the
servant
door
was
opened
and
mr
joseph
harrison
stepped
out
into
the
moonlight
joseph
ejaculated
phelps
he
was
bare
headed
but
he
had
black
coat
thrown
over
his
shoulder
so
that
he
could
conceal
his
face
in
an
instant
if
there
were
any
alarm
he
walked
on
tiptoe
under
the
shadow
of
the
wall
and
when
he
reached
the
window
he
worked
long
bladed
knife
through
the
sash
and
pushed
back
the
catch
then
he
flung
open
the
window
and
putting
his
knife
through
the
crack
in
the
shutters
he
thrust
the
bar
up
and
swung
them
open

from
where
lay
had
perfect
view
of
the
inside
of
the
room
and
of
every
one
of
his
movements
he
lit
the
two
candles
which
stood
upon
the
mantelpiece
and
then
he
proceeded
to
turn
back
the
corner
of
the
carpet
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
door
presently
he
stopped
and
picked
out
square
piece
of
board
such
as
is
usually
left
to
enable
plumbers
to
get
at
the
joints
of
the
gas
pipes
this
one
covered
as
matter
of
fact
the
joint
which
gives
off
the
pipe
which
supplies
the
kitchen
underneath
out
of
this
hiding
place
he
drew
that
little
cylinder
of
paper
pushed
down
the
board
rearranged
the
carpet
blew
out
the
candles
and
walked
straight
into
my
arms
as
stood
waiting
for
him
outside
the
window
well
he
has
rather
more
viciousness
than
gave
him
credit
for
has
master
joseph
he
flew
at
me
with
his
knife
and
had
to
grass
him
twice
and
got
cut
over
the
knuckles
before
had
the
upper
hand
of
him
he
looked
murder
out
of
the
only
eye
he
could
see
with
when
we
had
finished
but
he
listened
to
reason
and
gave
up
the
papers
having
got
them
let
my
man
go
but
wired
full
particulars
to
forbes
this
morning
if
he
is
quick
enough
to
catch
is
bird
well
and
good
but
if
as
shrewdly
suspect
he
finds
the
nest
empty
before
he
gets
there
why
all
the
better
for
the
government
fancy
that
lord
holdhurst
for
one
and
mr
percy
phelps
for
another
would
very
much
rather
that
the
affair
never
got
as
far
as
police
court
my
god
gasped
our
client
do
you
tell
me
that
during
these
long
ten
weeks
of
agony
the
stolen
papers
were
within
the
very
room
with
me
all
the
time
so
it
was
and
joseph
villain
and
thief
hum
am
afraid
joseph
character
is
rather
deeper
and
more
dangerous
one
than
one
might
judge
from
his
appearance
from
what
have
heard
from
him
this
morning
gather
that
he
has
lost
heavily
in
dabbling
with
stocks
and
that
he
is
ready
to
do
anything
on
earth
to
better
his
fortunes
being
an
absolutely
selfish
man
when
chance
presented
itself
he
did
not
allow
either
his
sister
happiness
or
your
reputation
to
hold
his
hand
percy
phelps
sank
back
in
his
chair
my
head
whirls
said
he
your
words
have
dazed
me
the
principal
difficulty
in
your
case
remarked
holmes
in
his
didactic
fashion
lay
in
the
fact
of
there
being
too
much
evidence
what
was
vital
was
overlaid
and
hidden
by
what
was
irrelevant
of
all
the
facts
which
were
presented
to
us
we
had
to
pick
just
those
which
we
deemed
to
be
essential
and
then
piece
them
together
in
their
order
so
as
to
reconstruct
this
very
remarkable
chain
of
events
had
already
begun
to
suspect
joseph
from
the
fact
that
you
had
intended
to
travel
home
with
him
that
night
and
that
therefore
it
was
likely
enough
thing
that
he
should
call
for
you
knowing
the
foreign
office
well
upon
his
way
when
heard
that
some
one
had
been
so
anxious
to
get
into
the
bedroom
in
which
no
one
but
joseph
could
have
concealed
anything
you
told
us
in
your
narrative
how
you
had
turned
joseph
out
when
you
arrived
with
the
doctor
my
suspicions
all
changed
to
certainties
especially
as
the
attempt
was
made
on
the
first
night
upon
which
the
nurse
was
absent
showing
that
the
intruder
was
well
acquainted
with
the
ways
of
the
house
how
blind
have
been
the
facts
of
the
case
as
far
as
have
worked
them
out
are
these
this
joseph
harrison
entered
the
office
through
the
charles
street
door
and
knowing
his
way
he
walked
straight
into
your
room
the
instant
after
you
left
it
finding
no
one
there
he
promptly
rang
the
bell
and
at
the
instant
that
he
did
so
his
eyes
caught
the
paper
upon
the
table
glance
showed
him
that
chance
had
put
in
his
way
state
document
of
immense
value
and
in
an
instant
he
had
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
and
was
gone
few
minutes
elapsed
as
you
remember
before
the
sleepy
commissionnaire
drew
your
attention
to
the
bell
and
those
were
just
enough
to
give
the
thief
time
to
make
his
escape
he
made
his
way
to
woking
by
the
first
train
and
having
examined
his
booty
and
assured
himself
that
it
really
was
of
immense
value
he
had
concealed
it
in
what
he
thought
was
very
safe
place
with
the
intention
of
taking
it
out
again
in
day
or
two
and
carrying
it
to
the
french
embassy
or
wherever
he
thought
that
long
price
was
to
be
had
then
came
your
sudden
return
he
without
moment
warning
was
bundled
out
of
his
room
and
from
that
time
onward
there
were
always
at
least
two
of
you
there
to
prevent
him
from
regaining
his
treasure
the
situation
to
him
must
have
been
maddening
one
but
at
last
he
thought
he
saw
his
chance
he
tried
to
steal
in
but
was
baffled
by
your
wakefulness
you
remember
that
you
did
not
take
your
usual
draught
that
night
remember
fancy
that
he
had
taken
steps
to
make
that
draught
efficacious
and
that
he
quite
relied
upon
your
being
unconscious
of
course
understood
that
he
would
repeat
the
attempt
whenever
it
could
be
done
with
safety
your
leaving
the
room
gave
him
the
chance
he
wanted
kept
miss
harrison
in
it
all
day
so
that
he
might
not
anticipate
us
then
having
given
him
the
idea
that
the
coast
was
clear
kept
guard
as
have
described
already
knew
that
the
papers
were
probably
in
the
room
but
had
no
desire
to
rip
up
all
the
planking
and
skirting
in
search
of
them
let
him
take
them
therefore
from
the
hiding
place
and
so
saved
myself
an
infinity
of
trouble
is
there
any
other
point
which
can
make
clear
why
did
he
try
the
window
on
the
first
occasion
asked
when
he
might
have
entered
by
the
door
in
reaching
the
door
he
would
have
to
pass
seven
bedrooms
on
the
other
hand
he
could
get
out
on
to
the
lawn
with
ease
anything
else
you
do
not
think
asked
phelps
that
he
had
any
murderous
intention
the
knife
was
only
meant
as
tool
it
may
be
so
answered
holmes
shrugging
his
shoulders
can
only
say
for
certain
that
mr
joseph
harrison
is
gentleman
to
whose
mercy
should
be
extremely
unwilling
to
trust
xi
the
final
problem
it
is
with
heavy
heart
that
take
up
my
pen
to
write
these
the
last
words
in
which
shall
ever
record
the
singular
gifts
by
which
my
friend
mr
sherlock
holmes
was
distinguished
in
an
incoherent
and
as
deeply
feel
an
entirely
inadequate
fashion
have
endeavored
to
give
some
account
of
my
strange
experiences
in
his
company
from
the
chance
which
first
brought
us
together
at
the
period
of
the
study
in
scarlet
up
to
the
time
of
his
interference
in
the
matter
of
the
naval
treaty
and
interference
which
had
the
unquestionable
effect
of
preventing
serious
international
complication
it
was
my
intention
to
have
stopped
there
and
to
have
said
nothing
of
that
event
which
has
created
void
in
my
life
which
the
lapse
of
two
years
has
done
little
to
fill
my
hand
has
been
forced
however
by
the
recent
letters
in
which
colonel
james
moriarty
defends
the
memory
of
his
brother
and
have
no
choice
but
to
lay
the
facts
before
the
public
exactly
as
they
occurred
alone
know
the
absolute
truth
of
the
matter
and
am
satisfied
that
the
time
has
come
when
on
good
purpose
is
to
be
served
by
its
suppression
as
far
as
know
there
have
been
only
three
accounts
in
the
public
press
that
in
the
journal
de
geneve
on
may
6th
1891
the
reuter
despatch
in
the
english
papers
on
may
7th
and
finally
the
recent
letter
to
which
have
alluded
of
these
the
first
and
second
were
extremely
condensed
while
the
last
is
as
shall
now
sow
an
absolute
perversion
of
the
facts
it
lies
with
me
to
tell
for
the
first
time
what
really
took
place
between
professor
moriarty
and
mr
sherlock
holmes
it
may
be
remembered
that
after
my
marriage
and
my
subsequent
start
in
private
practice
the
very
intimate
relations
which
had
existed
between
holmes
and
myself
became
to
some
extent
modified
he
still
came
to
me
from
time
to
time
when
he
desired
companion
in
his
investigation
but
these
occasions
grew
more
and
more
seldom
until
find
that
in
the
year
1890
there
were
only
three
cases
of
which
retain
any
record
during
the
winter
of
that
year
and
the
early
spring
of
1891
saw
in
the
papers
that
he
had
been
engaged
by
the
french
government
upon
matter
of
supreme
importance
and
received
two
notes
from
holmes
dated
from
narbonne
and
from
nimes
from
which
gathered
that
his
stay
in
france
was
likely
to
be
long
one
it
was
with
some
surprise
therefore
that
saw
him
walk
into
my
consulting
room
upon
the
evening
of
april
24th
it
struck
me
that
he
was
looking
even
paler
and
thinner
than
usual
yes
have
been
using
myself
up
rather
too
freely
he
remarked
in
answer
to
my
look
rather
than
to
my
words
have
been
little
pressed
of
late
have
you
any
objection
to
my
closing
your
shutters
the
only
light
in
the
room
came
from
the
lamp
upon
the
table
at
which
had
been
reading
holmes
edged
his
way
round
the
wall
and
flinging
the
shutters
together
he
bolted
them
securely

you
are
afraid
of
something
asked
well
am
of
what
of
air
guns
my
dear
holmes
what
do
you
mean
think
that
you
know
me
well
enough
watson
to
understand
that
am
by
no
means
nervous
man
at
the
same
time
it
is
stupidity
rather
than
courage
to
refuse
to
recognize
danger
when
it
is
close
upon
you
might
trouble
you
for
match
he
drew
in
the
smoke
of
his
cigarette
as
if
the
soothing
influence
was
grateful
to
him
must
apologize
for
calling
so
late
said
he
and
must
further
beg
you
to
be
so
unconventional
as
to
allow
me
to
leave
your
house
presently
by
scrambling
over
your
back
garden
wall
but
what
does
it
all
mean
asked
he
held
out
his
hand
and
saw
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
that
two
of
his
knuckles
were
burst
and
bleeding
it
is
not
an
airy
nothing
you
see
said
he
smiling
on
the
contrary
it
is
solid
enough
for
man
to
break
his
hand
over
is
mrs
watson
in
she
is
away
upon
visit
indeed
you
are
alone
quite
then
it
makes
it
the
easier
for
me
to
propose
that
you
should
come
away
with
me
for
week
to
the
continent
where
oh
anywhere
it
all
the
same
to
me
there
was
something
very
strange
in
all
this
it
was
not
holmes
nature
to
take
an
aimless
holiday
and
something
about
his
pale
worn
face
told
me
that
his
nerves
were
at
their
highest
tension
he
saw
the
question
in
my
eyes
and
putting
his
finger
tips
together
and
his
elbows
upon
his
knees
he
explained
the
situation
you
have
probably
never
heard
of
professor
moriarty
said
he
never
aye
there
the
genius
and
the
wonder
of
the
thing
he
cried
the
man
pervades
london
and
no
one
has
heard
of
him
that
what
puts
him
on
pinnacle
in
the
records
of
crime
tell
you
watson
in
all
seriousness
that
if
could
beat
that
man
if
could
free
society
of
him
should
feel
that
my
own
career
had
reached
its
summit
and
should
be
prepared
to
turn
to
some
more
placid
line
in
life
between
ourselves
the
recent
cases
in
which
have
been
of
assistance
to
the
royal
family
of
scandinavia
and
to
the
french
republic
have
left
me
in
such
position
that
could
continue
to
live
in
the
quiet
fashion
which
is
most
congenial
to
me
and
to
concentrate
my
attention
upon
my
chemical
researches
but
could
not
rest
watson
could
not
sit
quiet
in
my
chair
if
thought
that
such
man
as
professor
moriarty
were
walking
the
streets
of
london
unchallenged
what
has
he
done
then
his
career
has
been
an
extraordinary
one
he
is
man
of
good
birth
and
excellent
education
endowed
by
nature
with
phenomenal
mathematical
faculty
at
the
age
of
twenty
one
he
wrote
treatise
upon
the
binomial
theorem
which
has
had
european
vogue
on
the
strength
of
it
he
won
the
mathematical
chair
at
one
of
our
smaller
universities
and
had
to
all
appearance
most
brilliant
career
before
him
but
the
man
had
hereditary
tendencies
of
the
most
diabolical
kind
criminal
strain
ran
in
his
blood
which
instead
of
being
modified
was
increased
and
rendered
infinitely
more
dangerous
by
his
extraordinary
mental
powers
dark
rumors
gathered
round
him
in
the
university
town
and
eventually
he
was
compelled
to
resign
his
chair
and
to
come
down
to
london
where
he
set
up
as
an
army
coach
so
much
is
known
to
the
world
but
what
am
telling
you
now
is
what
have
myself
discovered
as
you
are
aware
watson
there
is
no
one
who
knows
the
higher
criminal
world
of
london
so
well
as
do
for
years
past
have
continually
been
conscious
of
some
power
behind
the
malefactor
some
deep
organizing
power
which
forever
stands
in
the
way
of
the
law
and
throws
it
shield
over
the
wrong
doer
again
and
again
in
cases
of
the
most
varying
sorts
forgery
cases
robberies
murders
have
felt
the
presence
of
this
force
and
have
deduced
its
action
in
many
of
those
undiscovered
crimes
in
which
have
not
been
personally
consulted
for
years
have
endeavored
to
break
through
the
veil
which
shrouded
it
and
at
last
the
time
came
when
seized
my
thread
and
followed
it
until
it
led
me
after
thousand
cunning
windings
to
ex
professor
moriarty
of
mathematical
celebrity
he
is
the
napoleon
of
crime
watson
he
is
the
organizer
of
half
that
is
evil
and
of
nearly
all
that
is
undetected
in
this
great
city
he
is
genius
philosopher
an
abstract
thinker
he
has
brain
of
the
first
order
he
sits
motionless
like
spider
in
the
center
of
its
web
but
that
web
has
thousand
radiations
and
he
knows
well
every
quiver
of
each
of
them
he
does
little
himself
he
only
plans
but
his
agents
are
numerous
and
splendidly
organized
is
there
crime
to
be
done
paper
to
be
abstracted
we
will
say
house
to
be
rifled
man
to
be
removed
the
word
is
passed
to
the
professor
the
matter
is
organized
and
carried
out
the
agent
may
be
caught
in
that
case
money
is
found
for
his
bail
or
his
defence
but
the
central
power
which
uses
the
agent
is
never
caught
never
so
much
as
suspected
this
was
the
organization
which
deduced
watson
and
which
devoted
my
whole
energy
to
exposing
and
breaking
up
but
the
professor
was
fenced
round
with
safeguards
so
cunningly
devised
that
do
what
would
it
seemed
impossible
to
get
evidence
which
would
convict
in
court
of
law
you
know
my
powers
my
dear
watson
and
yet
at
the
end
of
three
months
was
forced
to
confess
that
had
at
last
met
an
antagonist
who
was
my
intellectual
equal
my
horror
at
his
crimes
was
lost
in
my
admiration
at
his
skill
but
at
last
he
made
trip
only
little
trip
but
it
was
more
than
he
could
afford
when
was
so
close
upon
him
had
my
chance
and
starting
from
that
point
have
woven
my
net
round
him
until
now
it
is
all
ready
to
close
in
three
days
that
is
to
say
on
monday
next
matters
will
be
ripe
and
the
professor
with
all
the
principal
members
of
his
gang
will
be
in
the
hands
of
the
police
then
will
come
the
greatest
criminal
trial
of
the
century
the
clearing
up
of
over
forty
mysteries
and
the
rope
for
all
of
them
but
if
we
move
at
all
prematurely
you
understand
they
may
slip
out
of
our
hands
even
at
the
last
moment
now
if
could
have
done
this
without
the
knowledge
of
professor
moriarty
all
would
have
been
well
but
he
was
too
wily
for
that
he
saw
every
step
which
took
to
draw
my
toils
round
him
again
and
again
he
strove
to
break
away
but
as
often
headed
him
off
tell
you
my
friend
that
if
detailed
account
of
that
silent
contest
could
be
written
it
would
take
its
place
as
the
most
brilliant
bit
of
thrust
and
parry
work
in
the
history
of
detection
never
have
risen
to
such
height
and
never
have
been
so
hard
pressed
by
an
opponent
he
cut
deep
and
yet
just
undercut
him
this
morning
the
last
steps
were
taken
and
three
days
only
were
wanted
to
complete
the
business
was
sitting
in
my
room
thinking
the
matter
over
when
the
door
opened
and
professor
moriarty
stood
before
me
my
nerves
are
fairly
proof
watson
but
must
confess
to
start
when
saw
the
very
man
who
had
been
so
much
in
my
thoughts
standing
there
on
my
thresh
hold
his
appearance
was
quite
familiar
to
me
he
is
extremely
tall
and
thin
his
forehead
domes
out
in
white
curve
and
his
two
eyes
are
deeply
sunken
in
this
head
he
is
clean
shaven
pale
and
ascetic
looking
retaining
something
of
the
professor
in
his
features
his
shoulders
are
rounded
from
much
study
and
his
face
protrudes
forward
and
is
forever
slowly
oscillating
from
side
to
side
in
curiously
reptilian
fashion
he
peered
at
me
with
great
curiosity
in
his
puckered
eyes
you
have
less
frontal
development
that
should
have
expected
said
he
at
last
it
is
dangerous
habit
to
finger
loaded
firearms
in
the
pocket
of
one
dressing
gown
the
fact
is
that
upon
his
entrance
had
instantly
recognized
the
extreme
personal
danger
in
which
lay
the
only
conceivable
escape
for
him
lay
in
silencing
my
tongue
in
an
instant
had
slipped
the
revolved
from
the
drawer
into
my
pocket
and
was
covering
him
through
the
cloth
at
his
remark
drew
the
weapon
out
and
laid
it
cocked
upon
the
table
he
still
smiled
and
blinked
but
there
was
something
about
his
eyes
which
made
me
feel
very
glad
that
had
it
there
you
evidently
don
now
me
said
he
on
the
contrary
answered
think
it
is
fairly
evident
that
do
pray
take
chair
can
spare
you
five
minutes
if
you
have
anything
to
say
all
that
have
to
say
has
already
crossed
your
mind
said
he
then
possibly
my
answer
has
crossed
yours
replied
you
stand
fast
absolutely
he
clapped
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
raised
the
pistol
from
the
table
but
he
merely
drew
out
memorandum
book
in
which
he
had
scribbled
some
dates
you
crossed
my
patch
on
the
4th
of
january
said
he
on
the
23d
you
incommoded
me
by
the
middle
of
february
was
seriously
inconvenienced
by
you
at
the
end
of
march
was
absolutely
hampered
in
my
plans
and
now
at
the
close
of
april
find
myself
placed
in
such
position
through
your
continual
persecution
that
am
in
positive
danger
of
losing
my
liberty
the
situation
is
becoming
an
impossible
one

have
you
any
suggestion
to
make
asked
you
must
drop
it
mr
holmes
said
he
swaying
his
face
about
you
really
must
you
know
after
monday
said
tut
said
he
am
quite
sure
that
man
of
your
intelligence
will
see
that
there
can
be
but
one
outcome
to
this
affair
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
withdraw
you
have
worked
things
in
such
fashion
that
we
have
only
one
resource
it
has
been
an
intellectual
treat
to
me
to
see
the
way
in
which
you
have
grappled
with
this
affair
and
say
unaffectedly
that
it
would
be
grief
to
me
to
be
forced
to
take
any
extreme
measure
you
smile
sir
abut
assure
you
that
it
really
would
danger
is
part
of
my
trade
remarked
that
is
not
danger
said
he
it
is
inevitable
destruction
you
stand
in
the
way
not
merely
of
an
individual
but
of
might
organization
the
full
extent
of
which
you
with
all
your
cleverness
have
been
unable
to
realize
you
must
stand
clear
mr
holmes
or
be
trodden
under
foot
am
afraid
said
rising
that
in
the
pleasure
of
this
conversation
am
neglecting
business
of
importance
which
awaits
me
elsewhere
he
rose
also
and
looked
at
me
in
silence
shaking
his
head
sadly
well
said
he
at
last
it
seems
pity
but
have
done
what
could
know
every
move
of
your
game
you
can
do
nothing
before
monday
it
has
been
duel
between
you
and
me
mr
holmes
you
hope
to
place
me
in
the
dock
tell
you
that
will
never
stand
in
the
dock
you
hope
to
beat
me
tell
you
that
you
will
never
beat
me
if
you
are
clever
enough
to
bring
destruction
upon
me
rest
assured
that
shall
do
as
much
to
you
have
paid
me
several
compliments
mr
moriarty
said
let
me
pay
you
one
in
return
when
say
that
if
were
assured
of
the
former
eventuality
would
in
the
interests
of
the
public
cheerfully
accept
the
latter
can
promise
you
the
one
but
not
the
other
he
snarled
and
so
turned
his
rounded
back
upon
me
and
went
peering
and
blinking
out
of
the
room
that
was
my
singular
interview
with
professor
moriarty
confess
that
it
left
an
unpleasant
effect
upon
my
mind
his
soft
precise
fashion
of
speech
leaves
conviction
of
sincerity
which
mere
bully
could
not
produce
of
course
you
will
say
why
not
take
police
precautions
against
him
the
reason
is
that
am
well
convinced
that
it
is
from
his
agents
the
blow
will
fall
have
the
best
proofs
that
it
would
be
so
you
have
already
been
assaulted
my
dear
watson
professor
moriarty
is
not
man
who
lets
the
grass
grow
under
his
feet
went
out
about
mid
day
to
transact
some
business
in
oxford
street
as
passed
the
corner
which
leads
from
bentinck
street
on
to
the
welbeck
street
crossing
two
horse
van
furiously
driven
whizzed
round
and
was
on
me
like
flash
sprang
for
the
foot
path
and
saved
myself
by
the
fraction
of
second
the
van
dashed
round
by
marylebone
lane
and
was
gone
in
an
instant
kept
to
the
pavement
after
that
watson
but
as
walked
down
vere
street
brick
came
down
from
the
roof
of
one
of
the
houses
and
was
shattered
to
fragments
at
my
feet
called
the
police
and
had
the
place
examined
there
were
slates
and
bricks
piled
up
on
the
roof
preparatory
to
some
repairs
and
they
would
have
me
believe
that
the
wind
had
toppled
over
one
of
these
of
course
knew
better
but
could
prove
nothing
took
cab
after
that
and
reached
my
brother
rooms
in
pall
mall
where
spent
the
day
now
have
come
round
to
you
and
on
my
way
was
attacked
by
rough
with
bludgeon
knocked
him
down
and
the
police
have
him
in
custody
but
can
tell
you
with
the
most
absolute
confidence
that
no
possible
connection
will
ever
be
traced
between
the
gentleman
upon
whose
front
teeth
have
barked
my
knuckles
and
the
retiring
mathematical
coach
who
is
dare
say
working
out
problems
upon
black
board
ten
miles
away
you
will
not
wonder
watson
that
my
first
act
on
entering
your
rooms
was
to
close
your
shutters
and
that
have
been
compelled
to
ask
your
permission
to
leave
the
house
by
some
less
conspicuous
exit
than
the
front
door
had
often
admired
my
friend
courage
but
never
more
than
now
as
he
sat
quietly
checking
off
series
of
incidents
which
must
have
combined
to
make
up
day
of
horror
you
will
spend
the
night
here
said
no
my
friend
you
might
find
me
dangerous
guest
have
my
plans
laid
and
all
will
be
well
matters
have
gone
so
far
now
that
they
can
move
without
my
help
as
far
as
the
arrest
goes
though
my
presence
is
necessary
for
conviction
it
is
obvious
therefore
that
cannot
do
better
than
get
away
for
the
few
days
which
remain
before
the
police
are
at
liberty
to
act
it
would
be
great
pleasure
to
me
therefore
if
you
could
come
on
to
the
continent
with
me
the
practice
is
quiet
said
and
have
an
accommodating
neighbor
should
be
glad
to
come
and
to
start
to
morrow
morning
if
necessary
oh
yes
it
is
most
necessary
then
these
are
your
instructions
and
beg
my
dear
watson
that
you
will
obey
them
to
the
letter
for
you
are
now
playing
double
handed
game
with
me
against
the
cleverest
rogue
and
the
most
powerful
syndicate
of
criminals
in
europe
now
listen
you
will
despatch
whatever
luggage
you
intend
to
take
by
trusty
messenger
unaddressed
to
victoria
to
night
in
the
morning
you
will
send
for
hansom
desiring
your
man
to
take
neither
the
first
nor
the
second
which
may
present
itself
into
this
hansom
you
will
jump
and
you
will
drive
to
the
strand
end
of
the
lowther
arcade
handling
the
address
to
the
cabman
upon
slip
of
paper
with
request
that
he
will
not
throw
it
away
have
your
fare
ready
and
the
instant
that
your
cab
stops
dash
through
the
arcade
timing
yourself
to
reach
the
other
side
at
quarter
past
nine
you
will
find
small
brougham
waiting
close
to
the
curb
driven
by
fellow
with
heavy
black
cloak
tipped
at
the
collar
with
red
into
this
you
will
step
and
you
will
reach
victoria
in
time
for
the
continental
express
where
shall
meet
you
at
the
station
the
second
first
class
carriage
from
the
front
will
be
reserved
for
us
the
carriage
is
our
rendezvous
then
yes
it
was
in
vain
that
asked
holmes
to
remain
for
the
evening
it
was
evident
to
me
that
he
though
he
might
bring
trouble
to
the
roof
he
was
under
and
that
was
the
motive
which
impelled
him
to
go
with
few
hurried
words
as
to
our
plans
for
the
morrow
he
rose
and
came
out
with
me
into
the
garden
clambering
over
the
wall
which
leads
into
mortimer
street
and
immediately
whistling
for
hansom
in
which
heard
him
drive
away
in
the
morning
obeyed
holmes
injunctions
to
the
letter
hansom
was
procured
with
such
precaution
as
would
prevent
its
being
one
which
was
placed
ready
for
us
and
drove
immediately
after
breakfast
to
the
lowther
arcade
through
which
hurried
at
the
top
of
my
speed
brougham
was
waiting
with
very
massive
driver
wrapped
in
dark
cloak
who
the
instant
that
had
stepped
in
whipped
up
the
horse
and
rattled
off
to
victoria
station
on
my
alighting
there
he
turned
the
carriage
and
dashed
away
again
without
so
much
as
look
in
my
direction
so
far
all
had
gone
admirably
my
luggage
was
waiting
for
me
and
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
carriage
which
holmes
had
indicated
the
less
so
as
it
was
the
only
one
in
the
train
which
was
marked
engaged
my
only
source
of
anxiety
now
was
the
non
appearance
of
holmes
the
station
clock
marked
only
seven
minutes
from
the
time
when
we
were
due
to
start
in
vain
searched
among
the
groups
of
travellers
and
leave
takers
for
the
little
figure
of
my
friend
there
was
no
sign
of
him
spent
few
minutes
in
assisting
venerable
italian
priest
who
was
endeavoring
to
make
porter
understand
in
his
broken
english
that
his
luggage
was
to
be
booked
through
to
paris
then
having
taken
another
look
round
returned
to
my
carriage
where
found
that
the
porter
in
spite
of
the
ticket
had
given
me
my
decrepit
italian
friend
as
traveling
companion
it
was
useless
for
me
to
explain
to
him
that
his
presence
was
an
intrusion
for
my
italian
was
even
more
limited
than
his
english
so
shrugged
my
shoulders
resignedly
and
continued
to
look
out
anxiously
for
my
friend
chill
of
fear
had
come
over
me
as
thought
that
his
absence
might
mean
that
some
blow
had
fallen
during
the
night
already
the
doors
had
all
been
shut
and
the
whistle
blown
when—
my
dear
watson
said
voice
you
have
not
even
condescended
to
say
good
morning
turned
in
uncontrollable
astonishment
the
aged
ecclesiastic
had
turned
his
face
towards
me
for
an
instant
the
wrinkles
were
smoothed
away
the
nose
drew
away
from
the
chin
the
lower
lip
ceased
to
protrude
and
the
mouth
to
mumble
the
dull
eyes
regained
their
fire
the
drooping
figure
expanded
the
next
the
whole
frame
collapsed
again
and
holmes
had
gone
as
quickly
as
he
had
come
good
heavens
cried
how
you
startled
me

every
precaution
is
still
necessary
he
whispered
have
reason
to
think
that
they
are
hot
upon
our
trail
ah
there
is
moriarty
himself
the
train
had
already
begun
to
move
as
holmes
spoke
glancing
back
saw
tall
man
pushing
his
way
furiously
through
the
crowd
and
waving
his
hand
as
if
he
desired
to
have
the
train
stopped
it
was
too
late
however
for
we
were
rapidly
gathering
momentum
and
an
instant
later
had
shot
clear
of
the
station
with
all
our
precautions
you
see
that
we
have
cut
it
rather
fine
said
holmes
laughing
he
rose
and
throwing
off
the
black
cassock
and
hat
which
had
formed
his
disguise
he
packed
them
away
in
hand
bag
have
you
seen
the
morning
paper
watson
no
you
haven
seen
about
baker
street
then
baker
street
they
set
fire
to
our
rooms
last
night
no
great
harm
was
done
good
heavens
holmes
this
is
intolerable
they
must
have
lost
my
track
completely
after
their
bludgeon
man
was
arrested
otherwise
they
could
not
have
imagined
that
had
returned
to
my
rooms
they
have
evidently
taken
the
precaution
of
watching
you
however
and
that
is
what
has
brought
moriarty
to
victoria
you
could
not
have
made
any
slip
in
coming
did
exactly
what
you
advised
did
you
find
your
brougham
yes
it
was
waiting
did
you
recognize
your
coachman
no
it
was
my
brother
mycroft
it
is
an
advantage
to
get
about
in
such
case
without
taking
mercenary
into
your
confidence
but
we
must
plant
what
we
are
to
do
about
moriarty
now
as
this
is
an
express
and
as
the
boat
runs
in
connection
with
it
should
think
we
have
shaken
him
off
very
effectively
my
dear
watson
you
evidently
did
not
realize
my
meaning
when
said
that
this
man
may
be
taken
as
being
quite
on
the
same
intellectual
plane
as
myself
you
do
not
imagine
that
if
were
the
pursuer
should
allow
myself
to
be
baffled
by
so
slight
an
obstacle
why
then
should
you
think
so
meanly
of
him
what
will
he
do
what
should
do
what
would
you
do
then
engage
special
but
it
must
be
late
by
no
means
this
train
stops
at
canterbury
and
there
is
always
at
least
quarter
of
an
hour
delay
at
the
boat
he
will
catch
us
there
one
would
think
that
we
were
the
criminals
let
us
have
him
arrested
on
his
arrival
it
would
be
to
ruin
the
work
of
three
months
we
should
get
the
big
fish
but
the
smaller
would
dart
right
and
left
out
of
the
net
on
monday
we
should
have
them
all
no
an
arrest
is
inadmissible
what
then
we
shall
get
out
at
canterbury
and
then
well
then
we
must
make
cross
country
journey
to
newhaven
and
so
over
to
dieppe
moriarty
will
again
do
what
should
do
he
will
get
on
to
paris
mark
down
our
luggage
and
wait
for
two
days
at
the
depot
in
the
meantime
we
shall
treat
ourselves
to
couple
of
carpet
bags
encourage
the
manufactures
of
the
countries
through
which
we
travel
and
make
our
way
at
our
leisure
into
switzerland
via
luxembourg
and
basle
at
canterbury
therefore
we
alighted
only
to
find
that
we
should
have
to
wait
an
hour
before
we
could
get
train
to
newhaven
was
still
looking
rather
ruefully
after
the
rapidly
disappearing
luggage
van
which
contained
my
wardrobe
when
holmes
pulled
my
sleeve
and
pointed
up
the
line
already
you
see
said
he
far
away
from
among
the
kentish
woods
there
rose
thin
spray
of
smoke
minute
later
carriage
and
engine
could
be
seen
flying
along
the
open
curve
which
leads
to
the
station
we
had
hardly
time
to
take
our
place
behind
pile
of
luggage
when
it
passed
with
rattle
and
roar
beating
blast
of
hot
air
into
our
faces
there
he
goes
said
holmes
as
we
watched
the
carriage
swing
and
rock
over
the
point
there
are
limits
you
see
to
our
friend
intelligence
it
would
have
been
coup
de
maître
had
he
deduced
what
would
deduce
and
acted
accordingly
and
what
would
he
have
done
had
he
overtaken
us
there
cannot
be
the
least
doubt
that
he
would
have
made
murderous
attack
upon
me
it
is
however
game
at
which
two
may
play
the
question
now
is
whether
we
should
take
premature
lunch
here
or
run
our
chance
of
starving
before
we
reach
the
buffet
at
newhaven
we
made
our
way
to
brussels
that
night
and
spent
two
days
there
moving
on
upon
the
third
day
as
far
as
strasburg
on
the
monday
morning
holmes
had
telegraphed
to
the
london
police
and
in
the
evening
we
found
reply
waiting
for
us
at
our
hotel
holmes
tore
it
open
and
then
with
bitter
curse
hurled
it
into
the
grate
might
have
known
it
he
groaned
he
has
escaped
moriarty
they
have
secured
the
whole
gang
with
the
exception
of
him
he
has
given
them
the
slip
of
course
when
had
left
the
country
there
was
no
one
to
cope
with
him
but
did
think
that
had
put
the
game
in
their
hands
think
that
you
had
better
return
to
england
watson
why
because
you
will
find
me
dangerous
companion
now
this
man
occupation
is
gone
he
is
lost
if
he
returns
to
london
if
read
his
character
right
he
will
devote
his
whole
energies
to
revenging
himself
upon
me
he
said
as
much
in
our
short
interview
and
fancy
that
he
meant
it
should
certainly
recommend
you
to
return
to
your
practice
it
was
hardly
an
appeal
to
be
successful
with
one
who
was
an
old
campaigner
as
well
as
an
old
friend
we
sat
in
the
strasburg
salle
manger
arguing
the
question
for
half
an
hour
but
the
same
night
we
had
resumed
our
journey
and
were
well
on
our
way
to
geneva
for
charming
week
we
wandered
up
the
valley
of
the
rhone
and
then
branching
off
at
leuk
we
made
our
way
over
the
gemmi
pass
still
deep
in
snow
and
so
by
way
of
interlaken
to
meiringen
it
was
lovely
trip
the
dainty
green
of
the
spring
below
the
virgin
white
of
the
winter
above
but
it
was
clear
to
me
that
never
for
one
instant
did
holmes
forget
the
shadow
which
lay
across
him
in
the
homely
alpine
villages
or
in
the
lonely
mountain
passes
could
tell
by
his
quick
glancing
eyes
and
his
sharp
scrutiny
of
every
face
that
passed
us
that
he
was
well
convinced
that
walk
where
we
would
we
could
not
walk
ourselves
clear
of
the
danger
which
was
dogging
our
footsteps
once
remember
as
we
passed
over
the
gemmi
and
walked
along
the
border
of
the
melancholy
daubensee
large
rock
which
had
been
dislodged
from
the
ridge
upon
our
right
clattered
down
and
roared
into
the
lake
behind
us
in
an
instant
holmes
had
raced
up
on
to
the
ridge
and
standing
upon
lofty
pinnacle
craned
his
neck
in
every
direction
it
was
in
vain
that
our
guide
assured
him
that
fall
of
stones
was
common
chance
in
the
spring
time
at
that
spot
he
said
nothing
but
he
smiled
at
me
with
the
air
of
man
who
sees
the
fulfillment
of
that
which
he
had
expected
and
yet
for
all
his
watchfulness
he
was
never
depressed
on
the
contrary
can
never
recollect
having
seen
him
in
such
exuberant
spirits
again
and
again
he
recurred
to
the
fact
that
if
he
could
be
assured
that
society
was
freed
from
professor
moriarty
he
would
cheerfully
bring
his
own
career
to
conclusion
think
that
may
go
so
far
as
to
say
watson
that
have
not
lived
wholly
in
vain
he
remarked
if
my
record
were
closed
to
night
could
still
survey
it
with
equanimity
the
air
of
london
is
the
sweeter
for
my
presence
in
over
thousand
cases
am
not
aware
that
have
ever
used
my
powers
upon
the
wrong
side
of
late
have
been
tempted
to
look
into
the
problems
furnished
by
nature
rather
than
those
more
superficial
ones
for
which
our
artificial
state
of
society
is
responsible
your
memoirs
will
draw
to
an
end
watson
upon
the
day
that
crown
my
career
by
the
capture
or
extinction
of
the
most
dangerous
and
capable
criminal
in
europe
shall
be
brief
and
yet
exact
in
the
little
which
remains
for
me
to
tell
it
is
not
subject
on
which
would
willingly
dwell
and
yet
am
conscious
that
duty
devolves
upon
me
to
omit
no
detail
it
was
on
the
3d
of
may
that
we
reached
the
little
village
of
meiringen
where
we
put
up
at
the
englischer
hof
then
kept
by
peter
steiler
the
elder
our
landlord
was
an
intelligent
man
and
spoke
excellent
english
having
served
for
three
years
as
waiter
at
the
grosvenor
hotel
in
london
at
his
advice
on
the
afternoon
of
the
4th
we
set
off
together
with
the
intention
of
crossing
the
hills
and
spending
the
night
at
the
hamlet
of
rosenlaui
we
had
strict
injunctions
however
on
no
account
to
pass
the
falls
of
reichenbach
which
are
about
half
way
up
the
hill
without
making
small
detour
to
see
them
it
is
indeed
fearful
place
the
torrent
swollen
by
the
melting
snow
plunges
into
tremendous
abyss
from
which
the
spray
rolls
up
like
the
smoke
from
burning
house
the
shaft
into
which
the
river
hurls
itself
is
immense
chasm
lined
by
glistening
coal
black
rock
and
narrowing
into
creaming
boiling
pit
of
incalculable
depth
which
brims
over
and
shoots
the
stream
onward
over
its
jagged
lip
the
long
sweep
of
green
water
roaring
forever
down
and
the
thick
flickering
curtain
of
spray
hissing
forever
upward
turn
man
giddy
with
their
constant
whirl
and
clamor
we
stood
near
the
edge
peering
down
at
the
gleam
of
the
breaking
water
far
below
us
against
the
black
rocks
and
listening
to
the
half
human
shout
which
cam
booming
up
with
the
spray
out
of
the

the
path
has
been
cut
half
way
round
the
fall
to
afford
complete
view
but
it
ends
abruptly
and
the
traveler
has
to
return
as
he
came
we
had
turned
to
do
so
when
we
saw
swiss
lad
come
running
along
it
with
letter
in
his
hand
it
bore
the
mark
of
the
hotel
which
we
had
just
left
and
was
addressed
to
me
by
the
landlord
it
appeared
that
within
very
few
minutes
of
our
leaving
and
english
lady
had
arrived
who
was
in
the
last
stage
of
consumption
she
had
wintered
at
davos
platz
and
was
journeying
now
to
join
her
friends
at
lucerne
when
sudden
hemorrhage
had
overtaken
her
it
was
thought
that
she
could
hardly
live
few
hours
but
it
would
be
great
consolation
to
her
to
see
an
english
doctor
and
if
would
only
return
etc
the
good
steiler
assured
me
in
postscript
that
he
would
himself
look
upon
my
compliance
as
very
great
favor
since
the
lady
absolutely
refused
to
see
swiss
physician
and
he
could
not
but
feel
that
he
was
incurring
great
responsibility
the
appeal
was
one
which
could
not
be
ignored
it
was
impossible
to
refuse
the
request
of
fellow
countrywoman
dying
in
strange
land
yet
had
my
scruples
about
leaving
holmes
it
was
finally
agreed
however
that
he
should
retain
the
young
swiss
messenger
with
him
as
guide
and
companion
while
returned
to
meiringen
my
friend
would
stay
some
little
time
at
the
fall
he
said
and
would
then
walk
slowly
over
the
hill
to
rosenlaui
where
was
to
rejoin
him
in
the
evening
as
turned
away
saw
holmes
with
his
back
against
rock
and
his
arms
folded
gazing
down
at
the
rush
of
the
waters
it
was
the
last
that
was
ever
destined
to
see
of
him
in
this
world
when
was
near
the
bottom
of
the
descent
looked
back
it
was
impossible
from
that
position
to
see
the
fall
but
could
see
the
curving
path
which
winds
over
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
and
leads
to
it
along
this
man
was
remember
walking
very
rapidly
could
see
his
black
figure
clearly
outlined
against
the
green
behind
him
noted
him
and
the
energy
wit
which
he
walked
but
he
passed
from
my
mind
again
as
hurried
on
upon
my
errand
it
may
have
been
little
over
an
hour
before
reached
meiringen
old
steiler
was
standing
at
the
porch
of
his
hotel
well
said
as
came
hurrying
up
trust
that
she
is
no
worse
look
of
surprise
passed
over
his
face
and
at
the
first
quiver
of
his
eyebrows
my
heart
turned
to
lead
in
my
breast
you
did
not
write
this
said
pulling
the
letter
from
my
pocket
there
is
no
sick
englishwoman
in
the
hotel
certainly
not
he
cried
but
it
has
the
hotel
mark
upon
it
ha
it
must
have
been
written
by
that
tall
englishman
who
came
in
after
you
had
gone
he
said—
but
waited
for
none
of
the
landlord
explanations
in
tingle
of
fear
was
already
running
down
the
village
street
and
making
for
the
path
which
had
so
lately
descended
it
had
taken
me
an
hour
to
come
down
for
all
my
efforts
two
more
had
passed
before
found
myself
at
the
fall
of
reichenbach
once
more
there
was
holmes
alpine
stock
still
leaning
against
the
rock
by
which
had
left
him
but
there
was
no
sign
of
him
and
it
was
in
vain
that
shouted
my
only
answer
was
my
own
voice
reverberating
in
rolling
echo
from
the
cliffs
around
me
it
was
the
sight
of
that
alpine
stock
which
turned
me
cold
and
sick
he
had
not
gone
to
rosenlaui
then
he
had
remained
on
that
three
foot
path
with
sheer
wall
on
one
side
and
sheer
drop
on
the
other
until
his
enemy
had
overtaken
him
the
young
swiss
had
gone
too
he
had
probably
been
in
the
pay
of
moriarty
and
had
left
the
two
men
together
and
then
what
had
happened
who
was
to
tell
us
what
had
happened
then
stood
for
minute
or
two
to
collect
myself
for
was
dazed
with
the
horror
of
the
thing
then
began
to
think
of
holmes
own
methods
and
to
try
to
practise
them
in
reading
this
tragedy
it
was
alas
only
too
easy
to
do
during
our
conversation
we
had
not
gone
to
the
end
of
the
path
and
the
alpine
stock
marked
the
place
where
we
had
stood
the
blackish
soil
is
kept
forever
soft
by
the
incessant
drift
of
spray
and
bird
would
leave
its
tread
upon
it
two
lines
of
footmarks
were
clearly
marked
along
the
farther
end
of
the
path
both
leading
away
from
me
there
were
none
returning
few
yards
from
the
end
the
soil
was
all
ploughed
up
into
patch
of
mud
and
the
branches
and
ferns
which
fringed
the
chasm
were
torn
and
bedraggled
lay
upon
my
face
and
peered
over
with
the
spray
spouting
up
all
around
me
it
had
darkened
since
left
and
now
could
only
see
here
and
there
the
glistening
of
moisture
upon
the
black
walls
and
far
away
down
at
the
end
of
the
shaft
the
gleam
of
the
broken
water
shouted
but
only
the
same
half
human
cry
of
the
fall
was
borne
back
to
my
ears
but
it
was
destined
that
should
after
all
have
last
word
of
greeting
from
my
friend
and
comrade
have
said
that
his
alpine
stock
had
been
left
leaning
against
rock
which
jutted
on
to
the
path
from
the
top
of
this
bowlder
the
gleam
of
something
bright
caught
my
eye
and
raising
my
hand
found
that
it
came
from
the
silver
cigarette
case
which
he
used
to
carry
as
took
it
up
small
square
of
paper
upon
which
it
had
lain
fluttered
down
on
to
the
ground
unfolding
it
found
that
it
consisted
of
three
pages
torn
from
his
note
book
and
addressed
to
me
it
was
characteristic
of
the
man
that
the
direction
was
precise
and
the
writing
as
firm
and
clear
as
though
it
had
been
written
in
his
study
my
dear
watson
it
said
write
these
few
lines
through
the
courtesy
of
mr
moriarty
who
awaits
my
convenience
for
the
final
discussion
of
those
questions
which
lie
between
us
he
has
been
giving
me
sketch
of
the
methods
by
which
he
avoided
the
english
police
and
kept
himself
informed
of
our
movements
they
certainly
confirm
the
very
high
opinion
which
had
formed
of
his
abilities
am
pleased
to
think
that
shall
be
able
to
free
society
from
any
further
effects
of
his
presence
though
fear
that
it
is
at
cost
which
will
give
pain
to
my
friends
and
especially
my
dear
watson
to
you
have
already
explained
to
you
however
that
my
career
had
in
any
case
reached
its
crisis
and
that
no
possible
conclusion
to
it
could
be
more
congenial
to
me
than
this
indeed
if
may
make
full
confession
to
you
was
quite
convinced
that
the
letter
from
meiringen
was
hoax
and
allowed
you
to
depart
on
that
errand
under
the
persuasion
that
some
development
of
this
sort
would
follow
tell
inspector
patterson
that
the
papers
which
he
needs
to
convict
the
gang
are
in
pigeonhole
done
up
in
blue
envelope
and
inscribed
moriarty
made
every
disposition
of
my
property
before
leaving
england
and
handed
it
to
my
brother
mycroft
pray
give
my
greetings
to
mrs
watson
and
believe
me
to
be
my
dear
fellow
very
sincerely
yours
sherlock
holmes
few
words
may
suffice
to
tell
the
little
that
remains
an
examination
by
experts
leaves
little
doubt
that
personal
contest
between
the
two
men
ended
as
it
could
hardly
fail
to
end
in
such
situation
in
their
reeling
over
locked
in
each
other
arms
any
attempt
at
recovering
the
bodies
was
absolutely
hopeless
and
there
deep
down
in
that
dreadful
caldron
of
swirling
water
and
seething
foam
will
lie
for
all
time
the
most
dangerous
criminal
and
the
foremost
champion
of
the
law
of
their
generation
the
swiss
youth
was
never
found
again
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
was
one
of
the
numerous
agents
whom
moriarty
kept
in
this
employ
as
to
the
gang
it
will
be
within
the
memory
of
the
public
how
completely
the
evidence
which
holmes
had
accumulated
exposed
their
organization
and
how
heavily
the
hand
of
the
dead
man
weighted
upon
them
of
their
terrible
chief
few
details
came
out
during
the
proceedings
and
if
have
now
been
compelled
to
make
clear
statement
of
his
career
it
is
due
to
those
injudicious
champions
who
have
endeavored
to
clear
his
memory
by
attacks
upon
him
whom
shall
ever
regard
as
the
best
and
the
wisest
man
whom
have
ever
known
the
return
of
sherlock
holmes
1904
the
adventure
of
the
empty
house
it
was
in
the
spring
of
the
year
1894
that
all
london
was
interested
and
the
fashionable
world
dismayed
by
the
murder
of
the
honourable
ronald
adair
under
most
unusual
and
inexplicable
circumstances
the
public
has
already
learned
those
particulars
of
the
crime
which
came
out
in
the
police
investigation
but
good
deal
was
suppressed
upon
that
occasion
since
the
case
for
the
prosecution
was
so
overwhelmingly
strong
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
bring
forward
all
the
facts
only
now
at
the
end
of
nearly
ten
years
am
allowed
to
supply
those
missing
links
which
make
up
the
whole
of
that
remarkable
chain
the
crime
was
of
interest
in
itself
but
that
interest
was
as
nothing
to
me
compared
to
the
inconceivable
sequel
which
afforded
me
the
greatest
shock
and
surprise
of
any
event
in
my
adventurous
life
even
now
after
this
long
interval
find
myself
thrilling
as
think
of
it
and
feeling
once
more
that
sudden
flood
of
joy
amazement
and
incredulity
which
utterly
submerged
my
mind
let
me
say
to
that
public
which
has
shown
some
interest
in
those
glimpses
which
have
occasionally
given
them
of
the
thoughts
and
actions
of
very
remarkable
man
that
they
are
not
to
blame
me
if
have
not
shared
my
knowledge
with
them
for
should
have
considered
it
my
first
duty
to
have
done
so
had
not
been
barred
by
positive
prohibition
from
his
own
lips
which
was
only
withdrawn
upon
the
third
of
last

it
can
be
imagined
that
my
close
intimacy
with
sherlock
holmes
had
interested
me
deeply
in
crime
and
that
after
his
disappearance
never
failed
to
read
with
care
the
various
problems
which
came
before
the
public
and
even
attempted
more
than
once
for
my
own
private
satisfaction
to
employ
his
methods
in
their
solution
though
with
indifferent
success
there
was
none
however
which
appealed
to
me
like
this
tragedy
of
ronald
adair
as
read
the
evidence
at
the
inquest
which
led
up
to
verdict
of
wilful
murder
against
some
person
or
persons
unknown
realized
more
clearly
than
had
ever
done
the
loss
which
the
community
had
sustained
by
the
death
of
sherlock
holmes
there
were
points
about
this
strange
business
which
would
was
sure
have
specially
appealed
to
him
and
the
efforts
of
the
police
would
have
been
supplemented
or
more
probably
anticipated
by
the
trained
observation
and
the
alert
mind
of
the
first
criminal
agent
in
europe
all
day
as
drove
upon
my
round
turned
over
the
case
in
my
mind
and
found
no
explanation
which
appeared
to
me
to
be
adequate
at
the
risk
of
telling
twice
told
tale
will
recapitulate
the
facts
as
they
were
known
to
the
public
at
the
conclusion
of
the
inquest
the
honourable
ronald
adair
was
the
second
son
of
the
earl
of
maynooth
at
that
time
governor
of
one
of
the
australian
colonies
adair
mother
had
returned
from
australia
to
undergo
the
operation
for
cataract
and
she
her
son
ronald
and
her
daughter
hilda
were
living
together
at
427
park
lane
the
youth
moved
in
the
best
society
had
so
far
as
was
known
no
enemies
and
no
particular
vices
he
had
been
engaged
to
miss
edith
woodley
of
carstairs
but
the
engagement
had
been
broken
off
by
mutual
consent
some
months
before
and
there
was
no
sign
that
it
had
left
any
very
profound
feeling
behind
it
for
the
rest
the
man
life
moved
in
narrow
and
conventional
circle
for
his
habits
were
quiet
and
his
nature
unemotional
yet
it
was
upon
this
easy
going
young
aristocrat
that
death
came
in
most
strange
and
unexpected
form
between
the
hours
of
ten
and
eleven
twenty
on
the
night
of
march
30
1894
ronald
adair
was
fond
of
cards
playing
continually
but
never
for
such
stakes
as
would
hurt
him
he
was
member
of
the
baldwin
the
cavendish
and
the
bagatelle
card
clubs
it
was
shown
that
after
dinner
on
the
day
of
his
death
he
had
played
rubber
of
whist
at
the
latter
club
he
had
also
played
there
in
the
afternoon
the
evidence
of
those
who
had
played
with
him
mr
murray
sir
john
hardy
and
colonel
moran
showed
that
the
game
was
whist
and
that
there
was
fairly
equal
fall
of
the
cards
adair
might
have
lost
five
pounds
but
not
more
his
fortune
was
considerable
one
and
such
loss
could
not
in
any
way
affect
him
he
had
played
nearly
every
day
at
one
club
or
other
but
he
was
cautious
player
and
usually
rose
winner
it
came
out
in
evidence
that
in
partnership
with
colonel
moran
he
had
actually
won
as
much
as
four
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
in
sitting
some
weeks
before
from
godfrey
milner
and
lord
balmoral
so
much
for
his
recent
history
as
it
came
out
at
the
inquest
on
the
evening
of
the
crime
he
returned
from
the
club
exactly
at
ten
his
mother
and
sister
were
out
spending
the
evening
with
relation
the
servant
deposed
that
she
heard
him
enter
the
front
room
on
the
second
floor
generally
used
as
his
sitting
room
she
had
lit
fire
there
and
as
it
smoked
she
had
opened
the
window
no
sound
was
heard
from
the
room
until
eleven
twenty
the
hour
of
the
return
of
lady
maynooth
and
her
daughter
desiring
to
say
good
night
she
had
attempted
to
enter
her
son
room
the
door
was
locked
on
the
inside
and
no
answer
could
be
got
to
their
cries
and
knocking
help
was
obtained
and
the
door
forced
the
unfortunate
young
man
was
found
lying
near
the
table
his
head
had
been
horribly
mutilated
by
an
expanding
revolver
bullet
but
no
weapon
of
any
sort
was
to
be
found
in
the
room
on
the
table
lay
two
bank
notes
for
ten
pounds
each
and
seventeen
pounds
ten
in
silver
and
gold
the
money
arranged
in
little
piles
of
varying
amount
there
were
some
figures
also
upon
sheet
of
paper
with
the
names
of
some
club
friends
opposite
to
them
from
which
it
was
conjectured
that
before
his
death
he
was
endeavouring
to
make
out
his
losses
or
winnings
at
cards
minute
examination
of
the
circumstances
served
only
to
make
the
case
more
complex
in
the
first
place
no
reason
could
be
given
why
the
young
man
should
have
fastened
the
door
upon
the
inside
there
was
the
possibility
that
the
murderer
had
done
this
and
had
afterwards
escaped
by
the
window
the
drop
was
at
least
twenty
feet
however
and
bed
of
crocuses
in
full
bloom
lay
beneath
neither
the
flowers
nor
the
earth
showed
any
sign
of
having
been
disturbed
nor
were
there
any
marks
upon
the
narrow
strip
of
grass
which
separated
the
house
from
the
road
apparently
therefore
it
was
the
young
man
himself
who
had
fastened
the
door
but
how
did
he
come
by
his
death
no
one
could
have
climbed
up
to
the
window
without
leaving
traces
suppose
man
had
fired
through
the
window
it
would
indeed
be
remarkable
shot
who
could
with
revolver
inflict
so
deadly
wound
again
park
lane
is
frequented
thoroughfare
and
there
is
cab
stand
within
hundred
yards
of
the
house
no
one
had
heard
shot
and
yet
there
was
the
dead
man
and
there
the
revolver
bullet
which
had
mushroomed
out
as
soft
nosed
bullets
will
and
so
inflicted
wound
which
must
have
caused
instantaneous
death
such
were
the
circumstances
of
the
park
lane
mystery
which
were
further
complicated
by
entire
absence
of
motive
since
as
have
said
young
adair
was
not
known
to
have
any
enemy
and
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
remove
the
money
or
valuables
in
the
room
all
day
turned
these
facts
over
in
my
mind
endeavouring
to
hit
upon
some
theory
which
could
reconcile
them
all
and
to
find
that
line
of
least
resistance
which
my
poor
friend
had
declared
to
be
the
starting
point
of
every
investigation
confess
that
made
little
progress
in
the
evening
strolled
across
the
park
and
found
myself
about
six
clock
at
the
oxford
street
end
of
park
lane
group
of
loafers
upon
the
pavements
all
staring
up
at
particular
window
directed
me
to
the
house
which
had
come
to
see
tall
thin
man
with
coloured
glasses
whom
strongly
suspected
of
being
plain
clothes
detective
was
pointing
out
some
theory
of
his
own
while
the
others
crowded
round
to
listen
to
what
he
said
got
as
near
him
as
could
but
his
observations
seemed
to
me
to
be
absurd
so
withdrew
again
in
some
disgust
as
did
so
struck
against
an
elderly
deformed
man
who
had
been
behind
me
and
knocked
down
several
books
which
he
was
carrying
remember
that
as
picked
them
up
observed
the
title
of
one
of
them
the
origin
of
tree
worship
and
it
struck
me
that
the
fellow
must
be
some
poor
bibliophile
who
either
as
trade
or
as
hobby
was
collector
of
obscure
volumes
endeavoured
to
apologize
for
the
accident
but
it
was
evident
that
these
books
which
had
so
unfortunately
maltreated
were
very
precious
objects
in
the
eyes
of
their
owner
with
snarl
of
contempt
he
turned
upon
his
heel
and
saw
his
curved
back
and
white
side
whiskers
disappear
among
the
throng
my
observations
of
no
427
park
lane
did
little
to
clear
up
the
problem
in
which
was
interested
the
house
was
separated
from
the
street
by
low
wall
and
railing
the
whole
not
more
than
five
feet
high
it
was
perfectly
easy
therefore
for
anyone
to
get
into
the
garden
but
the
window
was
entirely
inaccessible
since
there
was
no
water
pipe
or
anything
which
could
help
the
most
active
man
to
climb
it
more
puzzled
than
ever
retraced
my
steps
to
kensington
had
not
been
in
my
study
five
minutes
when
the
maid
entered
to
say
that
person
desired
to
see
me
to
my
astonishment
it
was
none
other
than
my
strange
old
book
collector
his
sharp
wizened
face
peering
out
from
frame
of
white
hair
and
his
precious
volumes
dozen
of
them
at
least
wedged
under
his
right
arm
you
re
surprised
to
see
me
sir
said
he
in
strange
croaking
voice
acknowledged
that
was
well
ve
conscience
sir
and
when
chanced
to
see
you
go
into
this
house
as
came
hobbling
after
you
thought
to
myself
ll
just
step
in
and
see
that
kind
gentleman
and
tell
him
that
if
was
bit
gruff
in
my
manner
there
was
not
any
harm
meant
and
that
am
much
obliged
to
him
for
picking
up
my
books
you
make
too
much
of
trifle
said
may
ask
how
you
knew
who
was
well
sir
if
it
isn
too
great
liberty
am
neighbour
of
yours
for
you
ll
find
my
little
bookshop
at
the
corner
of
church
street
and
very
happy
to
see
you
am
sure
maybe
you
collect
yourself
sir
here
british
birds
and
catullus
and
the
holy
war
bargain
every
one
of
them
with
five
volumes
you
could
just
fill
that
gap
on
that
second
shelf
it
looks
untidy
does
it
not
sir
moved
my
head
to
look
at
the
cabinet
behind
me
when
turned
again
sherlock
holmes
was
standing
smiling
at
me
across
my
study
table
rose
to
my
feet
stared
at
him
for
some
seconds
in
utter
amazement
and
then
it
appears
that
must
have
fainted
for
the
first
and
the
last
time
in
my
life
certainly
grey
mist
swirled
before
my
eyes
and
when
it
cleared
found
my
collar
ends
undone
and
the
tingling
after
taste
of
brandy
upon
my
lips
holmes
was
bending
over
my
chair
his
flask
in
his
hand

my
dear
watson
said
the
well
remembered
voice
owe
you
thousand
apologies
had
no
idea
that
you
would
be
so
affected
gripped
him
by
the
arm
holmes
cried
is
it
really
you
can
it
indeed
be
that
you
are
alive
is
it
possible
that
you
succeeded
in
climbing
out
of
that
awful
abyss
wait
moment
said
he
are
you
sure
that
you
are
really
fit
to
discuss
things
have
given
you
serious
shock
by
my
unnecessarily
dramatic
reappearance
am
all
right
but
indeed
holmes
can
hardly
believe
my
eyes
good
heavens
to
think
that
you
of
all
men
should
be
standing
in
my
study
again
gripped
him
by
the
sleeve
and
felt
the
thin
sinewy
arm
beneath
it
well
you
re
not
spirit
anyhow
said
my
dear
chap
am
overjoyed
to
see
you
sit
down
and
tell
me
how
you
came
alive
out
of
that
dreadful
chasm
he
sat
opposite
to
me
and
lit
cigarette
in
his
old
nonchalant
manner
he
was
dressed
in
the
seedy
frock
coat
of
the
book
merchant
but
the
rest
of
that
individual
lay
in
pile
of
white
hair
and
old
books
upon
the
table
holmes
looked
even
thinner
and
keener
than
of
old
but
there
was
dead
white
tinge
in
his
aquiline
face
which
told
me
that
his
life
recently
had
not
been
healthy
one
am
glad
to
stretch
myself
watson
said
he
it
is
no
joke
when
tall
man
has
to
take
foot
off
his
stature
for
several
hours
on
end
now
my
dear
fellow
in
the
matter
of
these
explanations
we
have
if
may
ask
for
your
co
operation
hard
and
dangerous
night
work
in
front
of
us
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
gave
you
an
account
of
the
whole
situation
when
that
work
is
finished
am
full
of
curiosity
should
much
prefer
to
hear
now
you
ll
come
with
me
to
night
when
you
like
and
where
you
like
this
is
indeed
like
the
old
days
we
shall
have
time
for
mouthful
of
dinner
before
we
need
go
well
then
about
that
chasm
had
no
serious
difficulty
in
getting
out
of
it
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
never
was
in
it
you
never
were
in
it
no
watson
never
was
in
it
my
note
to
you
was
absolutely
genuine
had
little
doubt
that
had
come
to
the
end
of
my
career
when
perceived
the
somewhat
sinister
figure
of
the
late
professor
moriarty
standing
upon
the
narrow
pathway
which
led
to
safety
read
an
inexorable
purpose
in
his
grey
eyes
exchanged
some
remarks
with
him
therefore
and
obtained
his
courteous
permission
to
write
the
short
note
which
you
afterwards
received
left
it
with
my
cigarette
box
and
my
stick
and
walked
along
the
pathway
moriarty
still
at
my
heels
when
reached
the
end
stood
at
bay
he
drew
no
weapon
but
he
rushed
at
me
and
threw
his
long
arms
around
me
he
knew
that
his
own
game
was
up
and
was
only
anxious
to
revenge
himself
upon
me
we
tottered
together
upon
the
brink
of
the
fall
have
some
knowledge
however
of
baritsu
or
the
japanese
system
of
wrestling
which
has
more
than
once
been
very
useful
to
me
slipped
through
his
grip
and
he
with
horrible
scream
kicked
madly
for
few
seconds
and
clawed
the
air
with
both
his
hands
but
for
all
his
efforts
he
could
not
get
his
balance
and
over
he
went
with
my
face
over
the
brink
saw
him
fall
for
long
way
then
he
struck
rock
bounded
off
and
splashed
into
the
water
listened
with
amazement
to
this
explanation
which
holmes
delivered
between
the
puffs
of
his
cigarette
but
the
tracks
cried
saw
with
my
own
eyes
that
two
went
down
the
path
and
none
returned
it
came
about
in
this
way
the
instant
that
the
professor
had
disappeared
it
struck
me
what
really
extraordinarily
lucky
chance
fate
had
placed
in
my
way
knew
that
moriarty
was
not
the
only
man
who
had
sworn
my
death
there
were
at
least
three
others
whose
desire
for
vengeance
upon
me
would
only
be
increased
by
the
death
of
their
leader
they
were
all
most
dangerous
men
one
or
other
would
certainly
get
me
on
the
other
hand
if
all
the
world
was
convinced
that
was
dead
they
would
take
liberties
these
men
they
would
lay
themselves
open
and
sooner
or
later
could
destroy
them
then
it
would
be
time
for
me
to
announce
that
was
still
in
the
land
of
the
living
so
rapidly
does
the
brain
act
that
believe
had
thought
this
all
out
before
professor
moriarty
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
reichenbach
fall
stood
up
and
examined
the
rocky
wall
behind
me
in
your
picturesque
account
of
the
matter
which
read
with
great
interest
some
months
later
you
assert
that
the
wall
was
sheer
this
was
not
literally
true
few
small
footholds
presented
themselves
and
there
was
some
indication
of
ledge
the
cliff
is
so
high
that
to
climb
it
all
was
an
obvious
impossibility
and
it
was
equally
impossible
to
make
my
way
along
the
wet
path
without
leaving
some
tracks
might
it
is
true
have
reversed
my
boots
as
have
done
on
similar
occasions
but
the
sight
of
three
sets
of
tracks
in
one
direction
would
certainly
have
suggested
deception
on
the
whole
then
it
was
best
that
should
risk
the
climb
it
was
not
pleasant
business
watson
the
fall
roared
beneath
me
am
not
fanciful
person
but
give
you
my
word
that
seemed
to
hear
moriarty
voice
screaming
at
me
out
of
the
abyss
mistake
would
have
been
fatal
more
than
once
as
tufts
of
grass
came
out
in
my
hand
or
my
foot
slipped
in
the
wet
notches
of
the
rock
thought
that
was
gone
but
struggled
upwards
and
at
last
reached
ledge
several
feet
deep
and
covered
with
soft
green
moss
where
could
lie
unseen
in
the
most
perfect
comfort
there
was
stretched
when
you
my
dear
watson
and
all
your
following
were
investigating
in
the
most
sympathetic
and
inefficient
manner
the
circumstances
of
my
death
at
last
when
you
had
all
formed
your
inevitable
and
totally
erroneous
conclusions
you
departed
for
the
hotel
and
was
left
alone
had
imagined
that
had
reached
the
end
of
my
adventures
but
very
unexpected
occurrence
showed
me
that
there
were
surprises
still
in
store
for
me
huge
rock
falling
from
above
boomed
past
me
struck
the
path
and
bounded
over
into
the
chasm
for
an
instant
thought
that
it
was
an
accident
but
moment
later
looking
up
saw
man
head
against
the
darkening
sky
and
another
stone
struck
the
very
ledge
upon
which
was
stretched
within
foot
of
my
head
of
course
the
meaning
of
this
was
obvious
moriarty
had
not
been
alone
confederate
and
even
that
one
glance
had
told
me
how
dangerous
man
that
confederate
was
had
kept
guard
while
the
professor
had
attacked
me
from
distance
unseen
by
me
he
had
been
witness
of
his
friend
death
and
of
my
escape
he
had
waited
and
then
making
his
way
round
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
he
had
endeavoured
to
succeed
where
his
comrade
had
failed
did
not
take
long
to
think
about
it
watson
again
saw
that
grim
face
look
over
the
cliff
and
knew
that
it
was
the
precursor
of
another
stone
scrambled
down
on
to
the
path
don
think
could
have
done
it
in
cold
blood
it
was
hundred
times
more
difficult
than
getting
up
but
had
no
time
to
think
of
the
danger
for
another
stone
sang
past
me
as
hung
by
my
hands
from
the
edge
of
the
ledge
halfway
down
slipped
but
by
the
blessing
of
god
landed
torn
and
bleeding
upon
the
path
took
to
my
heels
did
ten
miles
over
the
mountains
in
the
darkness
and
week
later
found
myself
in
florence
with
the
certainty
that
no
one
in
the
world
knew
what
had
become
of
me
had
only
one
confidant
my
brother
mycroft
owe
you
many
apologies
my
dear
watson
but
it
was
all
important
that
it
should
be
thought
was
dead
and
it
is
quite
certain
that
you
would
not
have
written
so
convincing
an
account
of
my
unhappy
end
had
you
not
yourself
thought
that
it
was
true
several
times
during
the
last
three
years
have
taken
up
my
pen
to
write
to
you
but
always
feared
lest
your
affectionate
regard
for
me
should
tempt
you
to
some
indiscretion
which
would
betray
my
secret
for
that
reason
turned
away
from
you
this
evening
when
you
upset
my
books
for
was
in
danger
at
the
time
and
any
show
of
surprise
and
emotion
upon
your
part
might
have
drawn
attention
to
my
identity
and
led
to
the
most
deplorable
and
irreparable
results
as
to
mycroft
had
to
confide
in
him
in
order
to
obtain
the
money
which
needed
the
course
of
events
in
london
did
not
run
so
well
as
had
hoped
for
the
trial
of
the
moriarty
gang
left
two
of
its
most
dangerous
members
my
own
most
vindictive
enemies
at
liberty
travelled
for
two
years
in
tibet
therefore
and
amused
myself
by
visiting
lhassa
and
spending
some
days
with
the
head
llama
you
may
have
read
of
the
remarkable
explorations
of
norwegian
named
sigerson
but
am
sure
that
it
never
occurred
to
you
that
you
were
receiving
news
of
your
friend
then
passed
through
persia
looked
in
at
mecca
and
paid
short
but
interesting
visit
to
the
khalifa
at
khartoum
the
results
of
which
have
communicated
to
the
foreign
office
returning
to
france
spent
some
months
in
research
into
the
coal
tar
derivatives
which
conducted
in
laboratory
at
montpelier
in
the
south
of
france
having
concluded
this
to
my
satisfaction
and
learning
that
only
one
of
my
enemies
was
now
left
in
london
was
about
to
return
when
my
movements
were
hastened
by
the
news
of
this
very
remarkable
park
lane
mystery
which
not
only
appealed
to
me
by
its
own
merits
but
which
seemed
to
offer
some
most
peculiar
personal
opportunities
came
over
at
once
to
london
called
in
my
own
person
at
baker
street
threw
mrs
hudson
into
violent
hysterics
and
found
that
mycroft
had
preserved
my
rooms
and
my
papers
exactly
as
they
had
always
been
so
it
was
my
dear
watson
that
at
two
clock
to
day
found
myself
in
my
old
arm
chair
in
my
own
old
room
and
only
wishing
that
could
have
seen
my
old
friend
watson
in
the
other
chair
which
he
has
so
often
adorned

such
was
the
remarkable
narrative
to
which
listened
on
that
april
evening
narrative
which
would
have
been
utterly
incredible
to
me
had
it
not
been
confirmed
by
the
actual
sight
of
the
tall
spare
figure
and
the
keen
eager
face
which
had
never
thought
to
see
again
in
some
manner
he
had
learned
of
my
own
sad
bereavement
and
his
sympathy
was
shown
in
his
manner
rather
than
in
his
words
work
is
the
best
antidote
to
sorrow
my
dear
watson
said
he
and
have
piece
of
work
for
us
both
to
night
which
if
we
can
bring
it
to
successful
conclusion
will
in
itself
justify
man
life
on
this
planet
in
vain
begged
him
to
tell
me
more
you
will
hear
and
see
enough
before
morning
he
answered
we
have
three
years
of
the
past
to
discuss
let
that
suffice
until
half
past
nine
when
we
start
upon
the
notable
adventure
of
the
empty
house
it
was
indeed
like
old
times
when
at
that
hour
found
myself
seated
beside
him
in
hansom
my
revolver
in
my
pocket
and
the
thrill
of
adventure
in
my
heart
holmes
was
cold
and
stern
and
silent
as
the
gleam
of
the
street
lamps
flashed
upon
his
austere
features
saw
that
his
brows
were
drawn
down
in
thought
and
his
thin
lips
compressed
knew
not
what
wild
beast
we
were
about
to
hunt
down
in
the
dark
jungle
of
criminal
london
but
was
well
assured
from
the
bearing
of
this
master
huntsman
that
the
adventure
was
most
grave
one
while
the
sardonic
smile
which
occasionally
broke
through
his
ascetic
gloom
boded
little
good
for
the
object
of
our
quest
had
imagined
that
we
were
bound
for
baker
street
but
holmes
stopped
the
cab
at
the
corner
of
cavendish
square
observed
that
as
he
stepped
out
he
gave
most
searching
glance
to
right
and
left
and
at
every
subsequent
street
corner
he
took
the
utmost
pains
to
assure
that
he
was
not
followed
our
route
was
certainly
singular
one
holmes
knowledge
of
the
byways
of
london
was
extraordinary
and
on
this
occasion
he
passed
rapidly
and
with
an
assured
step
through
network
of
mews
and
stables
the
very
existence
of
which
had
never
known
we
emerged
at
last
into
small
road
lined
with
old
gloomy
houses
which
led
us
into
manchester
street
and
so
to
blandford
street
here
he
turned
swiftly
down
narrow
passage
passed
through
wooden
gate
into
deserted
yard
and
then
opened
with
key
the
back
door
of
house
we
entered
together
and
he
closed
it
behind
us
the
place
was
pitch
dark
but
it
was
evident
to
me
that
it
was
an
empty
house
our
feet
creaked
and
crackled
over
the
bare
planking
and
my
outstretched
hand
touched
wall
from
which
the
paper
was
hanging
in
ribbons
holmes
cold
thin
fingers
closed
round
my
wrist
and
led
me
forwards
down
long
hall
until
dimly
saw
the
murky
fanlight
over
the
door
here
holmes
turned
suddenly
to
the
right
and
we
found
ourselves
in
large
square
empty
room
heavily
shadowed
in
the
corners
but
faintly
lit
in
the
centre
from
the
lights
of
the
street
beyond
there
was
no
lamp
near
and
the
window
was
thick
with
dust
so
that
we
could
only
just
discern
each
other
figures
within
my
companion
put
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
and
his
lips
close
to
my
ear
do
you
know
where
we
are
he
whispered
surely
that
is
baker
street
answered
staring
through
the
dim
window
exactly
we
are
in
camden
house
which
stands
opposite
to
our
own
old
quarters
but
why
are
we
here
because
it
commands
so
excellent
view
of
that
picturesque
pile
might
trouble
you
my
dear
watson
to
draw
little
nearer
to
the
window
taking
every
precaution
not
to
show
yourself
and
then
to
look
up
at
our
old
rooms
the
starting
point
of
so
many
of
our
little
adventures
we
will
see
if
my
three
years
of
absence
have
entirely
taken
away
my
power
to
surprise
you
crept
forward
and
looked
across
at
the
familiar
window
as
my
eyes
fell
upon
it
gave
gasp
and
cry
of
amazement
the
blind
was
down
and
strong
light
was
burning
in
the
room
the
shadow
of
man
who
was
seated
in
chair
within
was
thrown
in
hard
black
outline
upon
the
luminous
screen
of
the
window
there
was
no
mistaking
the
poise
of
the
head
the
squareness
of
the
shoulders
the
sharpness
of
the
features
the
face
was
turned
half
round
and
the
effect
was
that
of
one
of
those
black
silhouettes
which
our
grandparents
loved
to
frame
it
was
perfect
reproduction
of
holmes
so
amazed
was
that
threw
out
my
hand
to
make
sure
that
the
man
himself
was
standing
beside
me
he
was
quivering
with
silent
laughter
well
said
he
good
heavens
cried
it
is
marvellous
trust
that
age
doth
not
wither
nor
custom
stale
my
infinite
variety
said
he
and
recognised
in
his
voice
the
joy
and
pride
which
the
artist
takes
in
his
own
creation
it
really
is
rather
like
me
is
it
not
should
be
prepared
to
swear
that
it
was
you
the
credit
of
the
execution
is
due
to
monsieur
oscar
meunier
of
grenoble
who
spent
some
days
in
doing
the
moulding
it
is
bust
in
wax
the
rest
arranged
myself
during
my
visit
to
baker
street
this
afternoon
but
why
because
my
dear
watson
had
the
strongest
possible
reason
for
wishing
certain
people
to
think
that
was
there
when
was
really
elsewhere
and
you
thought
the
rooms
were
watched
knew
that
they
were
watched
by
whom
by
my
old
enemies
watson
by
the
charming
society
whose
leader
lies
in
the
reichenbach
fall
you
must
remember
that
they
knew
and
only
they
knew
that
was
still
alive
sooner
or
later
they
believed
that
should
come
back
to
my
rooms
they
watched
them
continuously
and
this
morning
they
saw
me
arrive
how
do
you
know
because
recognised
their
sentinel
when
glanced
out
of
my
window
he
is
harmless
enough
fellow
parker
by
name
garroter
by
trade
and
remarkable
performer
upon
the
jew
harp
cared
nothing
for
him
but
cared
great
deal
for
the
much
more
formidable
person
who
was
behind
him
the
bosom
friend
of
moriarty
the
man
who
dropped
the
rocks
over
the
cliff
the
most
cunning
and
dangerous
criminal
in
london
that
is
the
man
who
is
after
me
to
night
watson
and
that
is
the
man
who
is
quite
unaware
that
we
are
after
him
my
friend
plans
were
gradually
revealing
themselves
from
this
convenient
retreat
the
watchers
were
being
watched
and
the
trackers
tracked
that
angular
shadow
up
yonder
was
the
bait
and
we
were
the
hunters
in
silence
we
stood
together
in
the
darkness
and
watched
the
hurrying
figures
who
passed
and
repassed
in
front
of
us
holmes
was
silent
and
motionless
but
could
tell
that
he
was
keenly
alert
and
that
his
eyes
were
fixed
intently
upon
the
stream
of
passers
by
it
was
bleak
and
boisterous
night
and
the
wind
whistled
shrilly
down
the
long
street
many
people
were
moving
to
and
fro
most
of
them
muffled
in
their
coats
and
cravats
once
or
twice
it
seemed
to
me
that
had
seen
the
same
figure
before
and
especially
noticed
two
men
who
appeared
to
be
sheltering
themselves
from
the
wind
in
the
doorway
of
house
some
distance
up
the
street
tried
to
draw
my
companion
attention
to
them
but
he
gave
little
ejaculation
of
impatience
and
continued
to
stare
into
the
street
more
than
once
he
fidgeted
with
his
feet
and
tapped
rapidly
with
his
fingers
upon
the
wall
it
was
evident
to
me
that
he
was
becoming
uneasy
and
that
his
plans
were
not
working
out
altogether
as
he
had
hoped
at
last
as
midnight
approached
and
the
street
gradually
cleared
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
in
uncontrollable
agitation
was
about
to
make
some
remark
to
him
when
raised
my
eyes
to
the
lighted
window
and
again
experienced
almost
as
great
surprise
as
before
clutched
holmes
arm
and
pointed
upwards
the
shadow
has
moved
cried
it
was
indeed
no
longer
the
profile
but
the
back
which
was
turned
towards
us
three
years
had
certainly
not
smoothed
the
asperities
of
his
temper
or
his
impatience
with
less
active
intelligence
than
his
own
of
course
it
has
moved
said
he
am
such
farcical
bungler
watson
that
should
erect
an
obvious
dummy
and
expect
that
some
of
the
sharpest
men
in
europe
would
be
deceived
by
it
we
have
been
in
this
room
two
hours
and
mrs
hudson
has
made
some
change
in
that
figure
eight
times
or
once
in
every
quarter
of
an
hour
she
works
it
from
the
front
so
that
her
shadow
may
never
be
seen
ah
he
drew
in
his
breath
with
shrill
excited
intake
in
the
dim
light
saw
his
head
thrown
forward
his
whole
attitude
rigid
with
attention
outside
the
street
was
absolutely
deserted
those
two
men
might
still
be
crouching
in
the
doorway
but
could
no
longer
see
them
all
was
still
and
dark
save
only
that
brilliant
yellow
screen
in
front
of
us
with
the
black
figure
outlined
upon
its
centre
again
in
the
utter
silence
heard
that
thin
sibilant
note
which
spoke
of
intense
suppressed
excitement
an
instant
later
he
pulled
me
back
into
the
blackest
corner
of
the
room
and
felt
his
warning
hand
upon
my
lips
the
fingers
which
clutched
me
were
quivering
never
had
known
my
friend
more
moved
and
yet
the
dark
street
still
stretched
lonely
and
motionless
before
us

but
suddenly
was
aware
of
that
which
his
keener
senses
had
already
distinguished
low
stealthy
sound
came
to
my
ears
not
from
the
direction
of
baker
street
but
from
the
back
of
the
very
house
in
which
we
lay
concealed
door
opened
and
shut
an
instant
later
steps
crept
down
the
passage
steps
which
were
meant
to
be
silent
but
which
reverberated
harshly
through
the
empty
house
holmes
crouched
back
against
the
wall
and
did
the
same
my
hand
closing
upon
the
handle
of
my
revolver
peering
through
the
gloom
saw
the
vague
outline
of
man
shade
blacker
than
the
blackness
of
the
open
door
he
stood
for
an
instant
and
then
he
crept
forward
crouching
menacing
into
the
room
he
was
within
three
yards
of
us
this
sinister
figure
and
had
braced
myself
to
meet
his
spring
before
realized
that
he
had
no
idea
of
our
presence
he
passed
close
beside
us
stole
over
to
the
window
and
very
softly
and
noiselessly
raised
it
for
half
foot
as
he
sank
to
the
level
of
this
opening
the
light
of
the
street
no
longer
dimmed
by
the
dusty
glass
fell
full
upon
his
face
the
man
seemed
to
be
beside
himself
with
excitement
his
two
eyes
shone
like
stars
and
his
features
were
working
convulsively
he
was
an
elderly
man
with
thin
projecting
nose
high
bald
forehead
and
huge
grizzled
moustache
an
opera
hat
was
pushed
to
the
back
of
his
head
and
an
evening
dress
shirt
front
gleamed
out
through
his
open
overcoat
his
face
was
gaunt
and
swarthy
scored
with
deep
savage
lines
in
his
hand
he
carried
what
appeared
to
be
stick
but
as
he
laid
it
down
upon
the
floor
it
gave
metallic
clang
then
from
the
pocket
of
his
overcoat
he
drew
bulky
object
and
he
busied
himself
in
some
task
which
ended
with
loud
sharp
click
as
if
spring
or
bolt
had
fallen
into
its
place
still
kneeling
upon
the
floor
he
bent
forward
and
threw
all
his
weight
and
strength
upon
some
lever
with
the
result
that
there
came
long
whirling
grinding
noise
ending
once
more
in
powerful
click
he
straightened
himself
then
and
saw
that
what
he
held
in
his
hand
was
sort
of
gun
with
curiously
misshapen
butt
he
opened
it
at
the
breech
put
something
in
and
snapped
the
breech
block
then
crouching
down
he
rested
the
end
of
the
barrel
upon
the
ledge
of
the
open
window
and
saw
his
long
moustache
droop
over
the
stock
and
his
eye
gleam
as
it
peered
along
the
sights
heard
little
sigh
of
satisfaction
as
he
cuddled
the
butt
into
his
shoulder
and
saw
that
amazing
target
the
black
man
on
the
yellow
ground
standing
clear
at
the
end
of
his
fore
sight
for
an
instant
he
was
rigid
and
motionless
then
his
finger
tightened
on
the
trigger
there
was
strange
loud
whiz
and
long
silvery
tinkle
of
broken
glass
at
that
instant
holmes
sprang
like
tiger
on
to
the
marksman
back
and
hurled
him
flat
upon
his
face
he
was
up
again
in
moment
and
with
convulsive
strength
he
seized
holmes
by
the
throat
but
struck
him
on
the
head
with
the
butt
of
my
revolver
and
he
dropped
again
upon
the
floor
fell
upon
him
and
as
held
him
my
comrade
blew
shrill
call
upon
whistle
there
was
the
clatter
of
running
feet
upon
the
pavement
and
two
policemen
in
uniform
with
one
plain
clothes
detective
rushed
through
the
front
entrance
and
into
the
room
that
you
lestrade
said
holmes
yes
mr
holmes
took
the
job
myself
it
good
to
see
you
back
in
london
sir
think
you
want
little
unofficial
help
three
undetected
murders
in
one
year
won
do
lestrade
but
you
handled
the
molesey
mystery
with
less
than
your
usual
that
to
say
you
handled
it
fairly
well
we
had
all
risen
to
our
feet
our
prisoner
breathing
hard
with
stalwart
constable
on
each
side
of
him
already
few
loiterers
had
begun
to
collect
in
the
street
holmes
stepped
up
to
the
window
closed
it
and
dropped
the
blinds
lestrade
had
produced
two
candles
and
the
policemen
had
uncovered
their
lanterns
was
able
at
last
to
have
good
look
at
our
prisoner
it
was
tremendously
virile
and
yet
sinister
face
which
was
turned
towards
us
with
the
brow
of
philosopher
above
and
the
jaw
of
sensualist
below
the
man
must
have
started
with
great
capacities
for
good
or
for
evil
but
one
could
not
look
upon
his
cruel
blue
eyes
with
their
drooping
cynical
lids
or
upon
the
fierce
aggressive
nose
and
the
threatening
deep
lined
brow
without
reading
nature
plainest
danger
signals
he
took
no
heed
of
any
of
us
but
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
holmes
face
with
an
expression
in
which
hatred
and
amazement
were
equally
blended
you
fiend
he
kept
on
muttering
you
clever
fiend
ah
colonel
said
holmes
arranging
his
rumpled
collar
journeys
end
in
lovers
meetings
as
the
old
play
says
don
think
have
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
since
you
favoured
me
with
those
attentions
as
lay
on
the
ledge
above
the
reichenbach
fall
the
colonel
still
stared
at
my
friend
like
man
in
trance
you
cunning
fiend
was
all
that
he
could
say
have
not
introduced
you
yet
said
holmes
this
gentlemen
is
colonel
sebastian
moran
once
of
her
majesty
indian
army
and
the
best
heavy
game
shot
that
our
eastern
empire
has
ever
produced
believe
am
correct
colonel
in
saying
that
your
bag
of
tigers
still
remains
unrivalled
the
fierce
old
man
said
nothing
but
still
glared
at
my
companion
with
his
savage
eyes
and
bristling
moustache
he
was
wonderfully
like
tiger
himself
wonder
that
my
very
simple
stratagem
could
deceive
so
old
shikari
said
holmes
it
must
be
very
familiar
to
you
have
you
not
tethered
young
kid
under
tree
lain
above
it
with
your
rifle
and
waited
for
the
bait
to
bring
up
your
tiger
this
empty
house
is
my
tree
and
you
are
my
tiger
you
have
possibly
had
other
guns
in
reserve
in
case
there
should
be
several
tigers
or
in
the
unlikely
supposition
of
your
own
aim
failing
you
these
he
pointed
around
are
my
other
guns
the
parallel
is
exact
colonel
moran
sprang
forward
with
snarl
of
rage
but
the
constables
dragged
him
back
the
fury
upon
his
face
was
terrible
to
look
at
confess
that
you
had
one
small
surprise
for
me
said
holmes
did
not
anticipate
that
you
would
yourself
make
use
of
this
empty
house
and
this
convenient
front
window
had
imagined
you
as
operating
from
the
street
where
my
friend
lestrade
and
his
merry
men
were
awaiting
you
with
that
exception
all
has
gone
as
expected
colonel
moran
turned
to
the
official
detective
you
may
or
may
not
have
just
cause
for
arresting
me
said
he
but
at
least
there
can
be
no
reason
why
should
submit
to
the
gibes
of
this
person
if
am
in
the
hands
of
the
law
let
things
be
done
in
legal
way
well
that
reasonable
enough
said
lestrade
nothing
further
you
have
to
say
mr
holmes
before
we
go
holmes
had
picked
up
the
powerful
air
gun
from
the
floor
and
was
examining
its
mechanism
an
admirable
and
unique
weapon
said
he
noiseless
and
of
tremendous
power
knew
von
herder
the
blind
german
mechanic
who
constructed
it
to
the
order
of
the
late
professor
moriarty
for
years
have
been
aware
of
its
existence
though
have
never
before
had
the
opportunity
of
handling
it
commend
it
very
specially
to
your
attention
lestrade
and
also
the
bullets
which
fit
it
you
can
trust
us
to
look
after
that
mr
holmes
said
lestrade
as
the
whole
party
moved
towards
the
door
anything
further
to
say
only
to
ask
what
charge
you
intend
to
prefer
what
charge
sir
why
of
course
the
attempted
murder
of
mr
sherlock
holmes
not
so
lestrade
do
not
propose
to
appear
in
the
matter
at
all
to
you
and
to
you
only
belongs
the
credit
of
the
remarkable
arrest
which
you
have
effected
yes
lestrade
congratulate
you
with
your
usual
happy
mixture
of
cunning
and
audacity
you
have
got
him
got
him
got
whom
mr
holmes
the
man
that
the
whole
force
has
been
seeking
in
vain
colonel
sebastian
moran
who
shot
the
honourable
ronald
adair
with
an
expanding
bullet
from
an
air
gun
through
the
open
window
of
the
second
floor
front
of
no
427
park
lane
upon
the
30th
of
last
month
that
the
charge
lestrade
and
now
watson
if
you
can
endure
the
draught
from
broken
window
think
that
half
an
hour
in
my
study
over
cigar
may
afford
you
some
profitable
amusement
our
old
chambers
had
been
left
unchanged
through
the
supervision
of
mycroft
holmes
and
the
immediate
care
of
mrs
hudson
as
entered
saw
it
is
true
an
unwonted
tidiness
but
the
old
landmarks
were
all
in
their
place
there
were
the
chemical
corner
and
the
acid
stained
deal
topped
table
there
upon
shelf
was
the
row
of
formidable
scrap
books
and
books
of
reference
which
many
of
our
fellow
citizens
would
have
been
so
glad
to
burn
the
diagrams
the
violin
case
and
the
pipe
rack
even
the
persian
slipper
which
contained
the
tobacco
all
met
my
eyes
as
glanced
round
me
there
were
two
occupants
of
the
room
one
mrs
hudson
who
beamed
upon
us
both
as
we
entered
the
other
the
strange
dummy
which
had
played
so
important
part
in
the
evening
adventures
it
was
wax
coloured
model
of
my
friend
so
admirably
done
that
it
was
perfect
facsimile
it
stood
on
small
pedestal
table
with
an
old
dressing
gown
of
holmes
so
draped
round
it
that
the
illusion
from
the
street
was
absolutely
perfect

hope
you
preserved
all
precautions
mrs
hudson
said
holmes
went
to
it
on
my
knees
sir
just
as
you
told
me
excellent
you
carried
the
thing
out
very
well
did
you
observe
where
the
bullet
went
yes
sir
afraid
it
has
spoilt
your
beautiful
bust
for
it
passed
right
through
the
head
and
flattened
itself
on
the
wall
picked
it
up
from
the
carpet
here
it
is
holmes
held
it
out
to
me
soft
revolver
bullet
as
you
perceive
watson
there
genius
in
that
for
who
would
expect
to
find
such
thing
fired
from
an
air
gun
all
right
mrs
hudson
am
much
obliged
for
your
assistance
and
now
watson
let
me
see
you
in
your
old
seat
once
more
for
there
are
several
points
which
should
like
to
discuss
with
you
he
had
thrown
off
the
seedy
frock
coat
and
now
he
was
the
holmes
of
old
in
the
mouse
coloured
dressing
gown
which
he
took
from
his
effigy
the
old
shikari
nerves
have
not
lost
their
steadiness
nor
his
eyes
their
keenness
said
he
with
laugh
as
he
inspected
the
shattered
forehead
of
his
bust
plumb
in
the
middle
of
the
back
of
the
head
and
smack
through
the
brain
he
was
the
best
shot
in
india
and
expect
that
there
are
few
better
in
london
have
you
heard
the
name
no
have
not
well
such
is
fame
but
then
if
remember
aright
you
had
not
heard
the
name
of
professor
james
moriarty
who
had
one
of
the
great
brains
of
the
century
just
give
me
down
my
index
of
biographies
from
the
shelf
he
turned
over
the
pages
lazily
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
blowing
great
clouds
from
his
cigar
my
collection
of
is
fine
one
said
he
moriarty
himself
is
enough
to
make
any
letter
illustrious
and
here
is
morgan
the
poisoner
and
merridew
of
abominable
memory
and
mathews
who
knocked
out
my
left
canine
in
the
waiting
room
at
charing
cross
and
finally
here
is
our
friend
of
to
night
he
handed
over
the
book
and
read

this
is
astonishing
said
as
handed
back
the

the
man
career
is
that
of
an
honourable
soldier
it
is
true
holmes
answered
up
to
certain
point
he
did
well
he
was
always
man
of
iron
nerve
and
the
story
is
still
told
in
india
how
he
crawled
down
drain
after
wounded
man
eating
tiger
there
are
some
trees
watson
which
grow
to
certain
height
and
then
suddenly
develop
some
unsightly
eccentricity
you
will
see
it
often
in
humans
have
theory
that
the
individual
represents
in
his
development
the
whole
procession
of
his
ancestors
and
that
such
sudden
turn
to
good
or
evil
stands
for
some
strong
influence
which
came
into
the
line
of
his
pedigree
the
person
becomes
as
it
were
the
epitome
of
the
history
of
his
own
family
it
is
surely
rather
fanciful
well
don
insist
upon
it
whatever
the
cause
colonel
moran
began
to
go
wrong
without
any
open
scandal
he
still
made
india
too
hot
to
hold
him
he
retired
came
to
london
and
again
acquired
an
evil
name
it
was
at
this
time
that
he
was
sought
out
by
professor
moriarty
to
whom
for
time
he
was
chief
of
the
staff
moriarty
supplied
him
liberally
with
money
and
used
him
only
in
one
or
two
very
high
class
jobs
which
no
ordinary
criminal
could
have
undertaken
you
may
have
some
recollection
of
the
death
of
mrs
stewart
of
lauder
in
1887
not
well
am
sure
moran
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
but
nothing
could
be
proved
so
cleverly
was
the
colonel
concealed
that
even
when
the
moriarty
gang
was
broken
up
we
could
not
incriminate
him
you
remember
at
that
date
when
called
upon
you
in
your
rooms
how
put
up
the
shutters
for
fear
of
air
guns
no
doubt
you
thought
me
fanciful
knew
exactly
what
was
doing
for
knew
of
the
existence
of
this
remarkable
gun
and
knew
also
that
one
of
the
best
shots
in
the
world
would
be
behind
it
when
we
were
in
switzerland
he
followed
us
with
moriarty
and
it
was
undoubtedly
he
who
gave
me
that
evil
five
minutes
on
the
reichenbach
ledge
you
may
think
that
read
the
papers
with
some
attention
during
my
sojourn
in
france
on
the
look
out
for
any
chance
of
laying
him
by
the
heels
so
long
as
he
was
free
in
london
my
life
would
really
not
have
been
worth
living
night
and
day
the
shadow
would
have
been
over
me
and
sooner
or
later
his
chance
must
have
come
what
could
do
could
not
shoot
him
at
sight
or
should
myself
be
in
the
dock
there
was
no
use
appealing
to
magistrate
they
cannot
interfere
on
the
strength
of
what
would
appear
to
them
to
be
wild
suspicion
so
could
do
nothing
but
watched
the
criminal
news
knowing
that
sooner
or
later
should
get
him
then
came
the
death
of
this
ronald
adair
my
chance
had
come
at
last
knowing
what
did
was
it
not
certain
that
colonel
moran
had
done
it
he
had
played
cards
with
the
lad
he
had
followed
him
home
from
the
club
he
had
shot
him
through
the
open
window
there
was
not
doubt
of
it
the
bullets
alone
are
enough
to
put
his
head
in
noose
came
over
at
once
was
seen
by
the
sentinel
who
would
knew
direct
the
colonel
attention
to
my
presence
he
could
not
fail
to
connect
my
sudden
return
with
his
crime
and
to
be
terribly
alarmed
was
sure
that
he
would
make
an
attempt
to
get
me
out
of
the
way
at
once
and
would
bring
round
his
murderous
weapon
for
that
purpose
left
him
an
excellent
mark
in
the
window
and
having
warned
the
police
that
they
might
be
needed
by
the
way
watson
you
spotted
their
presence
in
that
doorway
with
unerring
accuracy
took
up
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
judicious
post
for
observation
never
dreaming
that
he
would
choose
the
same
spot
for
his
attack
now
my
dear
watson
does
anything
remain
for
me
to
explain
yes
said
you
have
not
made
it
clear
what
was
colonel
moran
motive
in
murdering
the
honourable
ronald
adair
ah
my
dear
watson
there
we
come
into
those
realms
of
conjecture
where
the
most
logical
mind
may
be
at
fault
each
may
form
his
own
hypothesis
upon
the
present
evidence
and
yours
is
as
likely
to
be
correct
as
mine
you
have
formed
one
then
think
that
it
is
not
difficult
to
explain
the
facts
it
came
out
in
evidence
that
colonel
moran
and
young
adair
had
between
them
won
considerable
amount
of
money
now
moran
undoubtedly
played
foul
of
that
have
long
been
aware
believe
that
on
the
day
of
the
murder
adair
had
discovered
that
moran
was
cheating
very
likely
he
had
spoken
to
him
privately
and
had
threatened
to
expose
him
unless
he
voluntarily
resigned
his
membership
of
the
club
and
promised
not
to
play
cards
again
it
is
unlikely
that
youngster
like
adair
would
at
once
make
hideous
scandal
by
exposing
well
known
man
so
much
older
than
himself
probably
he
acted
as
suggest
the
exclusion
from
his
clubs
would
mean
ruin
to
moran
who
lived
by
his
ill
gotten
card
gains
he
therefore
murdered
adair
who
at
the
time
was
endeavouring
to
work
out
how
much
money
he
should
himself
return
since
he
could
not
profit
by
his
partner
foul
play
he
locked
the
door
lest
the
ladies
should
surprise
him
and
insist
upon
knowing
what
he
was
doing
with
these
names
and
coins
will
it
pass
have
no
doubt
that
you
have
hit
upon
the
truth
it
will
be
verified
or
disproved
at
the
trial
meanwhile
come
what
may
colonel
moran
will
trouble
us
no
more
the
famous
air
gun
of
von
herder
will
embellish
the
scotland
yard
museum
and
once
again
mr
sherlock
holmes
is
free
to
devote
his
life
to
examining
those
interesting
little
problems
which
the
complex
life
of
london
so
plentifully
presents
ii
the
adventure
of
the
norwood
builder
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
criminal
expert
said
mr
sherlock
holmes
london
has
become
singularly
uninteresting
city
since
the
death
of
the
late
lamented
professor
moriarty
can
hardly
think
that
you
would
find
many
decent
citizens
to
agree
with
you
answered
well
must
not
be
selfish
said
he
with
smile
as
he
pushed
back
his
chair
from
the
breakfast
table
the
community
is
certainly
the
gainer
and
no
one
the
loser
save
the
poor
out
of
work
specialist
whose
occupation
has
gone
with
that
man
in
the
field
one
morning
paper
presented
infinite
possibilities
often
it
was
only
the
smallest
trace
watson
the
faintest
indication
and
yet
it
was
enough
to
tell
me
that
the
great
malignant
brain
was
there
as
the
gentlest
tremors
of
the
edges
of
the
web
remind
one
of
the
foul
spider
which
lurks
in
the
centre
petty
thefts
wanton
assaults
purposeless
outrage
to
the
man
who
held
the
clue
all
could
be
worked
into
one
connected
whole
to
the
scientific
student
of
the
higher
criminal
world
no
capital
in
europe
offered
the
advantages
which
london
then
possessed
but
now
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
humorous
deprecation
of
the
state
of
things
which
he
had
himself
done
so
much
to
produce

at
the
time
of
which
speak
holmes
had
been
back
for
some
months
and
at
his
request
had
sold
my
practice
and
returned
to
share
the
old
quarters
in
baker
street
young
doctor
named
verner
had
purchased
my
small
kensington
practice
and
given
with
astonishingly
little
demur
the
highest
price
that
ventured
to
ask
an
incident
which
only
explained
itself
some
years
later
when
found
that
verner
was
distant
relation
of
holmes
and
that
it
was
my
friend
who
had
really
found
the
money
our
months
of
partnership
had
not
been
so
uneventful
as
he
had
stated
for
find
on
looking
over
my
notes
that
this
period
includes
the
case
of
the
papers
of
ex
president
murillo
and
also
the
shocking
affair
of
the
dutch
steamship
friesland
which
so
nearly
cost
us
both
our
lives
his
cold
and
proud
nature
was
always
averse
however
to
anything
in
the
shape
of
public
applause
and
he
bound
me
in
the
most
stringent
terms
to
say
no
further
word
of
himself
his
methods
or
his
successes
prohibition
which
as
have
explained
has
only
now
been
removed
mr
sherlock
holmes
was
leaning
back
in
his
chair
after
his
whimsical
protest
and
was
unfolding
his
morning
paper
in
leisurely
fashion
when
our
attention
was
arrested
by
tremendous
ring
at
the
bell
followed
immediately
by
hollow
drumming
sound
as
if
someone
were
beating
on
the
outer
door
with
his
fist
as
it
opened
there
came
tumultuous
rush
into
the
hall
rapid
feet
clattered
up
the
stair
and
an
instant
later
wild
eyed
and
frantic
young
man
pale
dishevelled
and
palpitating
burst
into
the
room
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
and
under
our
gaze
of
inquiry
he
became
conscious
that
some
apology
was
needed
for
this
unceremonious
entry
sorry
mr
holmes
he
cried
you
mustn
blame
me
am
nearly
mad
mr
holmes
am
the
unhappy
john
hector
mcFarlane
he
made
the
announcement
as
if
the
name
alone
would
explain
both
his
visit
and
its
manner
but
could
see
by
my
companion
unresponsive
face
that
it
meant
no
more
to
him
than
to
me
have
cigarette
mr
mcFarlane
said
he
pushing
his
case
across
am
sure
that
with
your
symptoms
my
friend
dr
watson
here
would
prescribe
sedative
the
weather
has
been
so
very
warm
these
last
few
days
now
if
you
feel
little
more
composed
should
be
glad
if
you
would
sit
down
in
that
chair
and
tell
us
very
slowly
and
quietly
who
you
are
and
what
it
is
that
you
want
you
mentioned
your
name
as
if
should
recognise
it
but
assure
you
that
beyond
the
obvious
facts
that
you
are
bachelor
solicitor
freemason
and
an
asthmatic
know
nothing
whatever
about
you
familiar
as
was
with
my
friend
methods
it
was
not
difficult
for
me
to
follow
his
deductions
and
to
observe
the
untidiness
of
attire
the
sheaf
of
legal
papers
the
watch
charm
and
the
breathing
which
had
prompted
them
our
client
however
stared
in
amazement
yes
am
all
that
mr
holmes
and
in
addition
am
the
most
unfortunate
man
at
this
moment
in
london
for
heaven
sake
don
abandon
me
mr
holmes
if
they
come
to
arrest
me
before
have
finished
my
story
make
them
give
me
time
so
that
may
tell
you
the
whole
truth
could
go
to
gaol
happy
if
knew
that
you
were
working
for
me
outside
arrest
you
said
holmes
this
is
really
most
grati
most
interesting
on
what
charge
do
you
expect
to
be
arrested
upon
the
charge
of
murdering
mr
jonas
oldacre
of
lower
norwood

companion

showed
sympathy
which
was
not
am
afraid
entirely
unmixed
with
satisfaction
dear
me
said
he
it
was
only
this
moment
at
breakfast
that
was
saying
to
my
friend
dr
watson
that
sensational
cases
had
disappeared
out
of
our
papers
our
visitor
stretched
forward
quivering
hand
and
picked
up
the
daily
telegraph
which
still
lay
upon
holmes
knee
if
you
had
looked
at
it
sir
you
would
have
seen
at
glance
what
the
errand
is
on
which
have
come
to
you
this
morning
feel
as
if
my
name
and
my
misfortune
must
be
in
every
man
mouth
he
turned
it
over
to
expose
the
central
page
here
it
is
and
with
your
permission
will
read
it
to
you
listen
to
this
mr
holmes
the
head
lines
are
mysterious
affair
at
lower
norwood
disappearance
of
well
known

of
murder
and
arson
clue
to
the
criminal
that
is
the
clue
which
they
are
already
following
mr
holmes
and
know
that
it
leads
infallibly
to
me

been
followed
from
london

and
am
sure
that
they
are
only
waiting
for
the
warrant
to
arrest
me
it
will
break
my
mother
heart
it
will
break
her
heart
he
wrung
his
hands
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
and
swayed
backwards
and
forwards
in
his
chair
looked
with
interest
upon
this
man
who
was
accused
of
being
the
perpetrator
of
crime
of
violence
he
was
flaxen
haired
and
handsome
in
washed
out
negative
fashion
with
frightened
blue
eyes
and
clean
shaven
face
with
weak
sensitive
mouth
his
age
may
have
been
about
twenty
seven
his
dress
and
bearing
that
of
gentleman
from
the
pocket
of
his
light
summer
overcoat
protruded
the
bundle
of
endorsed
papers
which
proclaimed
his
profession
we
must
use
what
time
we
have
said
holmes
watson
would
you
have
the
kindness
to
take
the
paper
and
to
read
me
the
paragraph
in
question
underneath
the
vigorous
head
lines
which
our
client
had
quoted
read
the
following
suggestive
narrative
late
last
night
or
early
this
morning
an
incident
occurred
at
lower
norwood
which
points
it
is
feared
to
serious
crime
mr
jonas
oldacre
is
well
known
resident
of
that
suburb
where
he
has
carried
on
his
business
as
builder
for
many
years
mr
oldacre
is
bachelor
fifty
two
years
of
age
and
lives
in
deep
dene
house
at
the
sydenham
end
of
the
road
of
that
name
he
has
had
the
reputation
of
being
man
of
eccentric
habits
secretive
and
retiring
for
some
years
he
has
practically
withdrawn
from
the
business
in
which
he
is
said
to
have
amassed
considerable
wealth
small
timber
yard
still
exists
however
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
last
night
about
twelve
clock
an
alarm
was
given
that
one
of
the
stacks
was
on
fire
the
engines
were
soon
upon
the
spot
but
the
dry
wood
burned
with
great
fury
and
it
was
impossible
to
arrest
the
conflagration
until
the
stack
had
been
entirely
consumed
up
to
this
point
the
incident
bore
the
appearance
of
an
ordinary
accident
but
fresh
indications
seem
to
point
to
serious
crime
surprise
was
expressed
at
the
absence
of
the
master
of
the
establishment
from
the
scene
of
the
fire
and
an
inquiry
followed
which
showed
that
he
had
disappeared
from
the
house
an
examination
of
his
room
revealed
that
the
bed
had
not
been
slept
in
that
safe
which
stood
in
it
was
open
that
number
of
important
papers
were
scattered
about
the
room
and
finally
that
there
were
signs
of
murderous
struggle
slight
traces
of
blood
being
found
within
the
room
and
an
oaken
walking
stick
which
also
showed
stains
of
blood
upon
the
handle
it
is
known
that
mr
jonas
oldacre
had
received
late
visitor
in
his
bedroom
upon
that
night
and
the
stick
found
has
been
identified
as
the
property
of
this
person
who
is
young
london
solicitor
named
john
hector
mcFarlane
junior
partner
of
graham
and
mcFarlane
of
426
gresham
buildings
the
police
believe
that
they
have
evidence
in
their
possession
which
supplies
very
convincing
motive
for
the
crime
and
altogether
it
cannot
be
doubted
that
sensational
developments
will
follow
later
it
is
rumoured
as
we
go
to
press
that
mr
john
hector
mcFarlane
has
actually
been
arrested
on
the
charge
of
the
murder
of
mr
jonas
oldacre
it
is
at
least
certain
that
warrant
has
been
issued
there
have
been
further
and
sinister
developments
in
the
investigation
at
norwood
besides
the
signs
of
struggle
in
the
room
of
the
unfortunate
builder
it
is
now
known
that
the
french
windows
of
his
bedroom
which
is
on
the
ground
floor
were
found
to
be
open
that
there
were
marks
as
if
some
bulky
object
had
been
dragged
across
to
the
wood
pile
and
finally
it
is
asserted
that
charred
remains
have
been
found
among
the
charcoal
ashes
of
the
fire
the
police
theory
is
that
most
sensational
crime
has
been
committed
that
the
victim
was
clubbed
to
death
in
his
own
bedroom
his
papers
rifled
and
his
dead
body
dragged
across
to
the
wood
stack
which
was
then
ignited
so
as
to
hide
all
traces
of
the
crime
the
conduct
of
the
criminal
investigation
has
been
left
in
the
experienced
hands
of
inspector
lestrade
of
scotland
yard
who
is
following
up
the
clues
with
his
accustomed
energy
and
sagacity
sherlock
holmes
listened
with
closed
eyes
and
finger
tips
together
to
this
remarkable
account
the
case
has
certainly
some
points
of
interest
said
he
in
his
languid
fashion
may
ask
in
the
first
place
mr
mcFarlane
how
it
is
that
you
are
still
at
liberty
since
there
appears
to
be
enough
evidence
to
justify
your
arrest
live
at
torrington
lodge
blackheath
with
my
parents
mr
holmes
but
last
night
having
to
do
business
very
late
with
mr
jonas
oldacre
stayed
at
an
hotel
in
norwood
and
came
to
my
business
from
there
knew
nothing
of
this
affair
until
was
in
the
train
when
read
what
you
have
just
heard
at
once
saw
the
horrible
danger
of
my
position
and
hurried
to
put
the
case
into
your
hands
have
no
doubt
that
should
have
been
arrested
either
at
my
city
office
or
at
my
home
man
followed
me
from
london
bridge
station
and
have
no
doubt
great
heaven
what
is

it
was
clang
of
the
bell
followed
instantly
by
heavy
steps
upon
the
stair
moment
later
our
old
friend
lestrade
appeared
in
the
doorway
over
his
shoulder
caught
glimpse
of
one
or
two
uniformed
policemen
outside
mr
john
hector
mcFarlane
said
lestrade
our
unfortunate
client
rose
with
ghastly
face
arrest
you
for
the
wilful
murder
of
mr
jonas
oldacre
of
lower
norwood
mcFarlane
turned
to
us
with
gesture
of
despair
and
sank
into
his
chair
once
more
like
one
who
is
crushed
one
moment
lestrade
said
holmes
half
an
hour
more
or
less
can
make
no
difference
to
you
and
the
gentleman
was
about
to
give
us
an
account
of
this
very
interesting
affair
which
might
aid
us
in
clearing
it
up
think
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
clearing
it
up
said
lestrade
grimly
none
the
less
with
your
permission
should
be
much
interested
to
hear
his
account
well
mr
holmes
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
refuse
you
anything
for
you
have
been
of
use
to
the
force
once
or
twice
in
the
past
and
we
owe
you
good
turn
at
scotland
yard
said
lestrade
at
the
same
time
must
remain
with
my
prisoner
and
am
bound
to
warn
him
that
anything
he
may
say
will
appear
in
evidence
against
him
wish
nothing
better
said
our
client
all
ask
is
that
you
should
hear
and
recognise
the
absolute
truth
lestrade
looked
at
his
watch
ll
give
you
half
an
hour
said
he
must
explain
first
said
mcFarlane
that
knew
nothing
of
mr
jonas
oldacre
his
name
was
familiar
to
me
for
many
years
ago
my
parents
were
acquainted
with
him
but
they
drifted
apart
was
very
much
surprised
therefore
when
yesterday
about
three
clock
in
the
afternoon
he
walked
into
my
office
in
the
city
but
was
still
more
astonished
when
he
told
me
the
object
of
his
visit
he
had
in
his
hand
several
sheets
of
note
book
covered
with
scribbled
writing
here
they
are
and
he
laid
them
on
my
table
here
is
my
will
said
he
want
you
mr
mcFarlane
to
cast
it
into
proper
legal
shape
will
sit
here
while
you
do
so
set
myself
to
copy
it
and
you
can
imagine
my
astonishment
when
found
that
with
some
reservations
he
had
left
all
his
property
to
me
he
was
strange
little
ferret
like
man
with
white
eyelashes
and
when
looked
up
at
him
found
his
keen
grey
eyes
fixed
upon
me
with
an
amused
expression
could
hardly
believe
my
own
senses
as
read
the
terms
of
the
will
but
he
explained
that
he
was
bachelor
with
hardly
any
living
relation
that
he
had
known
my
parents
in
his
youth
and
that
he
had
always
heard
of
me
as
very
deserving
young
man
and
was
assured
that
his
money
would
be
in
worthy
hands
of
course
could
only
stammer
out
my
thanks
the
will
was
duly
finished
signed
and
witnessed
by
my
clerk
this
is
it
on
the
blue
paper
and
these
slips
as
have
explained
are
the
rough
draft
mr
jonas
oldacre
then
informed
me
that
there
were
number
of
documents
building
leases
title
deeds
mortgages
scrip
and
so
forth
which
it
was
necessary
that
should
see
and
understand
he
said
that
his
mind
would
not
be
easy
until
the
whole
thing
was
settled
and
he
begged
me
to
come
out
to
his
house
at
norwood
that
night
bringing
the
will
with
me
and
to
arrange
matters
remember
my
boy
not
one
word
to
your
parents
about
the
affair
until
everything
is
settled
we
will
keep
it
as
little
surprise
for
them
he
was
very
insistent
upon
this
point
and
made
me
promise
it
faithfully
you
can
imagine
mr
holmes
that
was
not
in
humour
to
refuse
him
anything
that
he
might
ask
he
was
my
benefactor
and
all
my
desire
was
to
carry
out
his
wishes
in
every
particular
sent
telegram
home
therefore
to
say
that
had
important
business
on
hand
and
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
say
how
late
might
be
mr
oldacre
had
told
me
that
he
would
like
me
to
have
supper
with
him
at
nine
as
he
might
not
be
home
before
that
hour
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
his
house
however
and
it
was
nearly
half
past
before
reached
it
found
him
one
moment
said
holmes
who
opened
the
door
middle
aged
woman
who
was
suppose
his
housekeeper
and
it
was
she
presume
who
mentioned
your
name
exactly
said
mcFarlane
pray
proceed
mcFarlane
wiped
his
damp
brow
and
then
continued
his
narrative
was
shown
by
this
woman
into
sitting
room
where
frugal
supper
was
laid
out
afterwards
mr
jonas
oldacre
led
me
into
his
bedroom
in
which
there
stood
heavy
safe
this
he
opened
and
took
out
mass
of
documents
which
we
went
over
together
it
was
between
eleven
and
twelve
when
we
finished
he
remarked
that
we
must
not
disturb
the
housekeeper
he
showed
me
out
through
his
own
french
window
which
had
been
open
all
this
time
was
the
blind
down
asked
holmes
will
not
be
sure
but
believe
that
it
was
only
half
down
yes
remember
how
he
pulled
it
up
in
order
to
swing
open
the
window
could
not
find
my
stick
and
he
said
never
mind
my
boy
shall
see
good
deal
of
you
now
hope
and
will
keep
your
stick
until
you
come
back
to
claim
it
left
him
there
the
safe
open
and
the
papers
made
up
in
packets
upon
the
table
it
was
so
late
that
could
not
get
back
to
blackheath
so
spent
the
night
at
the
anerley
arms
and
knew
nothing
more
until
read
of
this
horrible
affair
in
the
morning
anything
more
that
you
would
like
to
ask
mr
holmes
said
lestrade
whose
eyebrows
had
gone
up
once
or
twice
during
this
remarkable
explanation
not
until
have
been
to
blackheath
you
mean
to
norwood
said
lestrade
oh
yes
no
doubt
that
is
what
must
have
meant
said
holmes
with
his
enigmatical
smile
lestrade
had
learned
by
more
experiences
than
he
would
care
to
acknowledge
that
razor
like
brain
could
cut
through
that
which
was
impenetrable
to
him
saw
him
look
curiously
at
my
companion
think
should
like
to
have
word
with
you
presently
mr
sherlock
holmes
said
he
now
mr
mcFarlane
two
of
my
constables
are
at
the
door
and
there
is
four
wheeler
waiting
the
wretched
young
man
arose
and
with
last
beseeching
glance
at
us
walked
from
the
room
the
officers
conducted
him
to
the
cab
but
lestrade
remained
holmes
had
picked
up
the
pages
which
formed
the
rough
draft
of
the
will
and
was
looking
at
them
with
the
keenest
interest
upon
his
face
there
are
some
points
about
that
document
lestrade
are
there
not
said
he
pushing
them
over
the
official
looked
at
them
with
puzzled
expression
can
read
the
first
few
lines
and
these
in
the
middle
of
the
second
page
and
one
or
two
at
the
end
those
are
as
clear
as
print
said
he
but
the
writing
in
between
is
very
bad
and
there
are
three
places
where
cannot
read
it
at
all
what
do
you
make
of
that
said
holmes
well
what
do
you
make
of
it
that
it
was
written
in
train
the
good
writing
represents
stations
the
bad
writing
movement
and
the
very
bad
writing
passing
over
points
scientific
expert
would
pronounce
at
once
that
this
was
drawn
up
on
suburban
line
since
nowhere
save
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
great
city
could
there
be
so
quick
succession
of
points
granting
that
his
whole
journey
was
occupied
in
drawing
up
the
will
then
the
train
was
an
express
only
stopping
once
between
norwood
and
london
bridge
lestrade
began
to
laugh
you
are
too
many
for
me
when
you
begin
to
get
on
your
theories
mr
holmes
said
he
how
does
this
bear
on
the
case
well
it
corroborates
the
young
man
story
to
the
extent
that
the
will
was
drawn
up
by
jonas
oldacre
in
his
journey
yesterday
it
is
curious
is
it
not
that
man
should
draw
up
so
important
document
in
so
haphazard
fashion
it
suggests
that
he
did
not
think
it
was
going
to
be
of
much
practical
importance
if
man
drew
up
will
which
he
did
not
intend
ever
to
be
effective
he
might
do
it
so
well
he
drew
up
his
own
death
warrant
at
the
same
time
said
lestrade
oh
you
think
so
don
you
well
it
is
quite
possible
but
the
case
is
not
clear
to
me
yet
not
clear
well
if
that
isn
clear
what
could
be
clear
here
is
young
man
who
learns
suddenly
that
if
certain
older
man
dies
he
will
succeed
to
fortune
what
does
he
do
he
says
nothing
to
anyone
but
he
arranges
that
he
shall
go
out
on
some
pretext
to
see
his
client
that
night
he
waits
until
the
only
other
person
in
the
house
is
in
bed
and
then
in
the
solitude
of
man
room
he
murders
him
burns
his
body
in
the
wood
pile
and
departs
to
neighbouring
hotel
the
blood
stains
in
the
room
and
also
on
the
stick
are
very
slight
it
is
probable
that
he
imagined
his
crime
to
be
bloodless
one
and
hoped
that
if
the
body
were
consumed
it
would
hide
all
traces
of
the
method
of
his
death
traces
which
for
some
reason
must
have
pointed
to
him
is
all
this
not
obvious
страница

it
strikes
me
my
good
lestrade
as
being
just
trifle
too
obvious
said
holmes
you
do
not
add
imagination
to
your
other
great
qualities
but
if
you
could
for
one
moment
put
yourself
in
the
place
of
this
young
man
would
you
choose
the
very
night
after
the
will
had
been
made
to
commit
your
crime
would
it
not
seem
dangerous
to
you
to
make
so
very
close
relation
between
the
two
incidents
again
would
you
choose
an
occasion
when
you
are
known
to
be
in
the
house
when
servant
has
let
you
in
and
finally
would
you
take
the
great
pains
to
conceal
the
body
and
yet
leave
your
own
stick
as
sign
that
you
were
the
criminal
confess
lestrade
that
all
this
is
very
unlikely
as
to
the
stick
mr
holmes
you
know
as
well
as
do
that
criminal
is
often
flurried
and
does
things
which
cool
man
would
avoid
he
was
very
likely
afraid
to
go
back
to
the
room
give
me
another
theory
that
would
fit
the
facts
could
very
easily
give
you
half
dozen
said
holmes
here
for
example
is
very
possible
and
even
probable
one
make
you
free
present
of
it
the
older
man
is
showing
documents
which
are
of
evident
value
passing
tramp
sees
them
through
the
window
the
blind
of
which
is
only
half
down
exit
the
solicitor
enter
the
tramp
he
seizes
stick
which
he
observes
there
kills
oldacre
and
departs
after
burning
the
body
why
should
the
tramp
burn
the
body
for
the
matter
of
that
why
should
mcFarlane
to
hide
some
evidence
possibly
the
tramp
wanted
to
hide
that
any
murder
at
all
had
been
committed
and
why
did
the
tramp
take
nothing
because
they
were
papers
that
he
could
not
negotiate
lestrade
shook
his
head
though
it
seemed
to
me
that
his
manner
was
less
absolutely
assured
than
before
well
mr
sherlock
holmes
you
may
look
for
your
tramp
and
while
you
are
finding
him
we
will
hold
on
to
our
man
the
future
will
show
which
is
right
just
notice
this
point
mr
holmes
that
so
far
as
we
know
none
of
the
papers
were
removed
and
that
the
prisoner
is
the
one
man
in
the
world
who
had
no
reason
for
removing
them
since
he
was
heir
at
law
and
would
come
into
them
in
any
case
my
friend
seemed
struck
by
this
remark
don
mean
to
deny
that
the
evidence
is
in
some
ways
very
strongly
in
favour
of
your
theory
said
he
only
wish
to
point
out
that
there
are
other
theories
possible
as
you
say
the
future
will
decide
good
morning
dare
say
that
in
the
course
of
the
day
shall
drop
in
at
norwood
and
see
how
you
are
getting
on
when
the
detective
departed
my
friend
rose
and
made
his
preparations
for
the
day
work
with
the
alert
air
of
man
who
has
congenial
task
before
him
my
first
movement
watson
said
he
as
he
bustled
into
his
frock
coat
must
as
said
be
in
the
direction
of
blackheath
and
why
not
norwood
because
we
have
in
this
case
one
singular
incident
coming
close
to
the
heels
of
another
singular
incident
the
police
are
making
the
mistake
of
concentrating
their
attention
upon
the
second
because
it
happens
to
be
the
one
which
is
actually
criminal
but
it
is
evident
to
me
that
the
logical
way
to
approach
the
case
is
to
begin
by
trying
to
throw
some
light
upon
the
first
incident
the
curious
will
so
suddenly
made
and
to
so
unexpected
an
heir
it
may
do
something
to
simplify
what
followed
no
my
dear
fellow
don
think
you
can
help
me
there
is
no
prospect
of
danger
or
should
not
dream
of
stirring
out
without
you
trust
that
when
see
you
in
the
evening
will
be
able
to
report
that
have
been
able
to
do
something
for
this
unfortunate
youngster
who
has
thrown
himself
upon
my
protection
it
was
late
when
my
friend
returned
and
could
see
by
glance
at
his
haggard
and
anxious
face
that
the
high
hopes
with
which
he
had
started
had
not
been
fulfilled
for
an
hour
he
droned
away
upon
his
violin
endeavouring
to
soothe
his
own
ruffled
spirits
at
last
he
flung
down
the
instrument
and
plunged
into
detailed
account
of
his
misadventures
it
all
going
wrong
watson
all
as
wrong
as
it
can
go
kept
bold
face
before
lestrade
but
upon
my
soul
believe
that
for
once
the
fellow
is
on
the
right
track
and
we
are
on
the
wrong
all
my
instincts
are
one
way
and
all
the
facts
are
the
other
and
much
fear
that
british
juries
have
not
yet
attained
that
pitch
of
intelligence
when
they
will
give
the
preference
to
my
theories
over
lestrade
facts
did
you
go
to
blackheath
yes
watson
went
there
and
found
very
quickly
that
the
late
lamented
oldacre
was
pretty
considerable
black
guard
the
father
was
away
in
search
of
his
son
the
mother
was
at
home
little
fluffy
blue
eyed
person
in
tremor
of
fear
and
indignation
of
course
she
would
not
admit
even
the
possibility
of
his
guilt
but
she
would
not
express
either
surprise
or
regret
over
the
fate
of
oldacre
on
the
contrary
she
spoke
of
him
with
such
bitterness
that
she
was
unconsciously
considerably
strengthening
the
case
of
the
police
for
of
course
if
her
son
had
heard
her
speak
of
the
man
in
this
fashion
it
would
predispose
him
towards
hatred
and
violence
he
was
more
like
malignant
and
cunning
ape
than
human
being
said
she
and
he
always
was
ever
since
he
was
young
man
you
knew
him
at
that
time
said
yes
knew
him
well
in
fact
he
was
an
old
suitor
of
mine
thank
heaven
that
had
the
sense
to
turn
away
from
him
and
to
marry
better
if
poorer
man
was
engaged
to
him
mr
holmes
when
heard
shocking
story
of
how
he
had
turned
cat
loose
in
an
aviary
and
was
so
horrified
at
his
brutal
cruelty
that
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him
she
rummaged
in
bureau
and
presently
she
produced
photograph
of
woman
shamefully
defaced
and
mutilated
with
knife
that
is
my
own
photograph
she
said
he
sent
it
to
me
in
that
state
with
his
curse
upon
my
wedding
morning
well
said
at
least
he
has
forgiven
you
now
since
he
has
left
all
his
property
to
your
son
neither
my
son
nor
want
anything
from
jonas
oldacre
dead
or
alive
she
cried
with
proper
spirit
there
is
god
in
heaven
mr
holmes
and
that
same
god
who
has
punished
that
wicked
man
will
show
in
his
own
good
time
that
my
son
hands
are
guiltless
of
his
blood
well
tried
one
or
two
leads
but
could
get
at
nothing
which
would
help
our
hypothesis
and
several
points
which
would
make
against
it
gave
it
up
at
last
and
off
went
to
norwood
this
place
deep
dene
house
is
big
modern
villa
of
staring
brick
standing
back
in
its
own
grounds
with
laurel
clumped
lawn
in
front
of
it
to
the
right
and
some
distance
back
from
the
road
was
the
timber
yard
which
had
been
the
scene
of
the
fire
here
rough
plan
on
leaf
of
my
note
book
this
window
on
the
left
is
the
one
which
opens
into
oldacre
room
you
can
look
into
it
from
the
road
you
see
that
is
about
the
only
bit
of
consolation
have
had
to
day
lestrade
was
not
there
but
his
head
constable
did
the
honours
they
had
just
made
great
treasure
trove
they
had
spent
the
morning
raking
among
the
ashes
of
the
burned
wood
pile
and
besides
the
charred
organic
remains
they
had
secured
several
discoloured
metal
discs
examined
them
with
care
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
they
were
trouser
buttons
even
distinguished
that
one
of
them
was
marked
with
the
name
of
hyams
who
was
oldacre
tailor
then
worked
the
lawn
very
carefully
for
signs
and
traces
but
this
drought
has
made
everything
as
hard
as
iron
nothing
was
to
be
seen
save
that
some
body
or
bundle
had
been
dragged
through
low
privet
hedge
which
is
in
line
with
the
wood
pile
all
that
of
course
fits
in
with
the
official
theory
crawled
about
the
lawn
with
an
august
sun
on
my
back
but
got
up
at
the
end
of
an
hour
no
wiser
than
before
well
after
this
fiasco
went
into
the
bedroom
and
examined
that
also
the
blood
stains
were
very
slight
mere
smears
and
discolourations
but
undoubtedly
fresh
the
stick
had
been
removed
but
there
also
the
marks
were
slight
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
stick
belonging
to
our
client
he
admits
it
footmarks
of
both
men
could
be
made
out
on
the
carpet
but
none
of
any
third
person
which
again
is
trick
for
the
other
side
they
were
piling
up
their
score
all
the
time
and
we
were
at
standstill
only
one
little
gleam
of
hope
did
get
and
yet
it
amounted
to
nothing
examined
the
contents
of
the
safe
most
of
which
had
been
taken
out
and
left
on
the
table
the
papers
had
been
made
up
into
sealed
envelopes
one
or
two
of
which
had
been
opened
by
the
police
they
were
not
so
far
as
could
judge
of
any
great
value
nor
did
the
bank
book
show
that
mr
oldacre
was
in
such
very
affluent
circumstances
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
the
papers
were
not
there
were
allusions
to
some
deeds
possibly
the
more
valuable
which
could
not
find
this
of
course
if
we
could
definitely
prove
it
would
turn
lestrade
argument
against
himself
for
who
would
steal
thing
if
he
knew
that
he
would
shortly
inherit
it

finally
having
drawn
every
other
cover
and
picked
up
no
scent
tried
my
luck
with
the
housekeeper
mrs
lexington
is
her
name
little
dark
silent
person
with
suspicious
and
sidelong
eyes
she
could
tell
us
something
if
she
would
am
convinced
of
it
but
she
was
as
close
as
wax
yes
she
had
let
mr
mcFarlane
in
at
half
past
nine
she
wished
her
hand
had
withered
before
she
had
done
so
she
had
gone
to
bed
at
half
past
ten
her
room
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
and
she
could
hear
nothing
of
what
passed
mr
mcFarlane
had
left
his
hat
and
to
the
best
of
her
belief
his
stick
in
the
hall
she
had
been
awakened
by
the
alarm
of
fire
her
poor
dear
master
had
certainly
been
murdered
had
he
any
enemies
well
every
man
had
enemies
but
mr
oldacre
kept
himself
very
much
to
himself
and
only
met
people
in
the
way
of
business
she
had
seen
the
buttons
and
was
sure
that
they
belonged
to
the
clothes
which
he
had
worn
last
night
the
wood
pile
was
very
dry
for
it
had
not
rained
for
month
it
burned
like
tinder
and
by
the
time
she
reached
the
spot
nothing
could
be
seen
but
flames
she
and
all
the
firemen
smelled
the
burned
flesh
from
inside
it
she
knew
nothing
of
the
papers
nor
of
mr
oldacre
private
affairs
so
my
dear
watson
there
my
report
of
failure
and
yet
and
yet
he
clenched
his
thin
hands
in
paroxysm
of
conviction
know
it
all
wrong
feel
it
in
my
bones
there
is
something
that
has
not
come
out
and
that
housekeeper
knows
it
there
was
sort
of
sulky
defiance
in
her
eyes
which
only
goes
with
guilty
knowledge
however
there
no
good
talking
any
more
about
it
watson
but
unless
some
lucky
chance
comes
our
way
fear
that
the
norwood
disappearance
case
will
not
figure
in
that
chronicle
of
our
successes
which
foresee
that
patient
public
will
sooner
or
later
have
to
endure
surely
said
the
man
appearance
would
go
far
with
any
jury
that
is
dangerous
argument
my
dear
watson
you
remember
that
terrible
murderer
bert
stevens
who
wanted
us
to
get
him
off
in
87
was
there
ever
more
mild
mannered
sunday
school
young
man
it
is
true
unless
we
succeed
in
establishing
an
alternative
theory
this
man
is
lost
you
can
hardly
find
flaw
in
the
case
which
can
now
be
presented
against
him
and
all
further
investigation
has
served
to
strengthen
it
by
the
way
there
is
one
curious
little
point
about
those
papers
which
may
serve
us
as
the
starting
point
for
an
inquiry
on
looking
over
the
bank
book
found
that
the
low
state
of
the
balance
was
principally
due
to
large
cheques
which
have
been
made
out
during
the
last
year
to
mr
cornelius
confess
that
should
be
interested
to
know
who
this
mr
cornelius
may
be
with
whom
retired
builder
has
such
very
large
transactions
is
it
possible
that
he
has
had
hand
in
the
affair
cornelius
might
be
broker
but
we
have
found
no
scrip
to
correspond
with
these
large
payments
failing
any
other
indication
my
researches
must
now
take
the
direction
of
an
inquiry
at
the
bank
for
the
gentleman
who
has
cashed
these
cheques
but
fear
my
dear
fellow
that
our
case
will
end
ingloriously
by
lestrade
hanging
our
client
which
will
certainly
be
triumph
for
scotland
yard
do
not
know
how
far
sherlock
holmes
took
any
sleep
that
night
but
when
came
down
to
breakfast
found
him
pale
and
harassed
his
bright
eyes
the
brighter
for
the
dark
shadows
round
them
the
carpet
round
his
chair
was
littered
with
cigarette
ends
and
with
the
early
editions
of
the
morning
papers
an
open
telegram
lay
upon
the
table
what
do
you
think
of
this
watson
he
asked
tossing
it
across
it
was
from
norwood
and
ran
as
follows
important
fresh
evidence
to
hand
mcfarlane
guilt
definitely
established
advise
you
to
abandon
case
lestrade
this
sounds
serious
said
it
is
lestrade
little
cock
doodle
of
victory
holmes
answered
with
bitter
smile
and
yet
it
may
be
premature
to
abandon
the
case
after
all
important
fresh
evidence
is
two
edged
thing
and
may
possibly
cut
in
very
different
direction
to
that
which
lestrade
imagines
take
your
breakfast
watson
and
we
will
go
out
together
and
see
what
we
can
do
feel
as
if
shall
need
your
company
and
your
moral
support
to
day
my
friend
had
no
breakfast
himself
for
it
was
one
of
his
peculiarities
that
in
his
more
intense
moments
he
would
permit
himself
no
food
and
have
known
him
presume
upon
his
iron
strength
until
he
has
fainted
from
pure
inanition
at
present
cannot
spare
energy
and
nerve
force
for
digestion
he
would
say
in
answer
to
my
medical
remonstrances
was
not
surprised
therefore
when
this
morning
he
left
his
untouched
meal
behind
him
and
started
with
me
for
norwood
crowd
of
morbid
sightseers
were
still
gathered
round
deep
dene
house
which
was
just
such
suburban
villa
as
had
pictured
within
the
gates
lestrade
met
us
his
face
flushed
with
victory
his
manner
grossly
triumphant
well
mr
holmes
have
you
proved
us
to
be
wrong
yet
have
you
found
your
tramp
he
cried
have
formed
no
conclusion
whatever
my
companion
answered
but
we
formed
ours
yesterday
and
now
it
proves
to
be
correct
so
you
must
acknowledge
that
we
have
been
little
in
front
of
you
this
time
mr
holmes
you
certainly
have
the
air
of
something
unusual
having
occurred
said
holmes
lestrade
laughed
loudly
you
don
like
being
beaten
any
more
than
the
rest
of
us
do
said
he
man
can
expect
always
to
have
it
his
own
way
can
he
dr
watson
step
this
way
if
you
please
gentlemen
and
think
can
convince
you
once
for
all
that
it
was
john
mcFarlane
who
did
this
crime
he
led
us
through
the
passage
and
out
into
dark
hall
beyond
this
is
where
young
mcFarlane
must
have
come
out
to
get
his
hat
after
the
crime
was
done
said
he
now
look
at
this
with
dramatic
suddenness
he
struck
match
and
by
its
light
exposed
stain
of
blood
upon
the
whitewashed
wall
as
he
held
the
match
nearer
saw
that
it
was
more
than
stain
it
was
the
well
marked
print
of
thumb
look
at
that
with
your
magnifying
glass
mr
holmes
yes
am
doing
so
you
are
aware
that
no
two
thumb
marks
are
alike
have
heard
something
of
the
kind
well
then
will
you
please
compare
that
print
with
this
wax
impression
of
young
mcFarlane
right
thumb
taken
by
my
orders
this
morning
as
he
held
the
waxen
print
close
to
the
blood
stain
it
did
not
take
magnifying
glass
to
see
that
the
two
were
undoubtedly
from
the
same
thumb
it
was
evident
to
me
that
our
unfortunate
client
was
lost
that
is
final
said
lestrade
yes
that
is
final
involuntarily
echoed
it
is
final
said
holmes
something
in
his
tone
caught
my
ear
and
turned
to
look
at
him
an
extraordinary
change
had
come
over
his
face
it
was
writhing
with
inward
merriment
his
two
eyes
were
shining
like
stars
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
making
desperate
efforts
to
restrain
convulsive
attack
of
laughter
dear
me
dear
me
he
said
at
last
well
now
who
would
have
thought
it
and
how
deceptive
appearances
may
be
to
be
sure
such
nice
young
man
to
look
at
it
is
lesson
to
us
not
to
trust
our
own
judgment
is
it
not
lestrade
yes
some
of
us
are
little
too
much
inclined
to
be
cocksure
mr
holmes
said
lestrade
the
man
insolence
was
maddening
but
we
could
not
resent
it
what
providential
thing
that
this
young
man
should
press
his
right
thumb
against
the
wall
in
taking
his
hat
from
the
peg
such
very
natural
action
too
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
holmes
was
outwardly
calm
but
his
whole
body
gave
wriggle
of
suppressed
excitement
as
he
spoke
by
the
way
lestrade
who
made
this
remarkable
discovery
it
was
the
housekeeper
mrs
lexington
who
drew
the
night
constable
attention
to
it
where
was
the
night
constable
he
remained
on
guard
in
the
bedroom
where
the
crime
was
committed
so
as
to
see
that
nothing
was
touched
but
why
didn
the
police
see
this
mark
yesterday
well
we
had
no
particular
reason
to
make
careful
examination
of
the
hall
besides
it
not
in
very
prominent
place
as
you
see
no
of
course
not
suppose
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
mark
was
there
yesterday
lestrade
looked
at
holmes
as
if
he
thought
he
was
going
out
of
his
mind
confess
that
was
myself
surprised
both
at
his
hilarious
manner
and
at
his
rather
wild
observation
don
know
whether
you
think
that
mcFarlane
came
out
of
gaol
in
the
dead
of
the
night
in
order
to
strengthen
the
evidence
against
himself
said
lestrade
leave
it
to
any
expert
in
the
world
whether
that
is
not
the
mark
of
his
thumb
it
is
unquestionably
the
mark
of
his
thumb
there
that
enough
said
lestrade
am
practical
man
mr
holmes
and
when
have
got
my
evidence
come
to
my
conclusions
if
you
have
anything
to
say
you
will
find
me
writing
my
report
in
the
sitting
room

holmes
had
recovered
his
equanimity
though
still
seemed
to
detect
gleams
of
amusement
in
his
expression
dear
me
this
is
very
sad
development
watson
is
it
not
said
he
and
yet
there
are
singular
points
about
it
which
hold
out
some
hopes
for
our
client
am
delighted
to
hear
it
said
heartily
was
afraid
it
was
all
up
with
him
would
hardly
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
my
dear
watson
the
fact
is
that
there
is
one
really
serious
flaw
in
this
evidence
to
which
our
friend
attaches
so
much
importance
indeed
holmes
what
is
it
only
this
that
know
that
mark
was
not
there
when
examined
the
hall
yesterday
and
now
watson
let
us
have
little
stroll
round
in
the
sunshine
with
confused
brain
but
with
heart
into
which
some
warmth
of
hope
was
returning
accompanied
my
friend
in
walk
round
the
garden
holmes
took
each
face
of
the
house
in
turn
and
examined
it
with
great
interest
he
then
led
the
way
inside
and
went
over
the
whole
building
from
basement
to
attics
most
of
the
rooms
were
unfurnished
but
none
the
less
holmes
inspected
them
all
minutely
finally
on
the
top
corridor
which
ran
outside
three
untenanted
bedrooms
he
again
was
seized
with
spasm
of
merriment
there
are
really
some
very
unique
features
about
this
case
watson
said
he
think
it
is
time
now
that
we
took
our
friend
lestrade
into
our
confidence
he
has
had
his
little
smile
at
our
expense
and
perhaps
we
may
do
as
much
by
him
if
my
reading
of
this
problem
proves
to
be
correct
yes
think
see
how
we
should
approach
it
the
scotland
yard
inspector
was
still
writing
in
the
parlour
when
holmes
interrupted
him
understood
that
you
were
writing
report
of
this
case
said
he
so
am
don
you
think
it
may
be
little
premature
can
help
thinking
that
your
evidence
is
not
complete
lestrade
knew
my
friend
too
well
to
disregard
his
words
he
laid
down
his
pen
and
looked
curiously
at
him
what
do
you
mean
mr
holmes
only
that
there
is
an
important
witness
whom
you
have
not
seen
can
you
produce
him
think
can
then
do
so
will
do
my
best
how
many
constables
have
you
there
are
three
within
call
excellent
said
holmes
may
ask
if
they
are
all
large
able
bodied
men
with
powerful
voices
have
no
doubt
they
are
though
fail
to
see
what
their
voices
have
to
do
with
it
perhaps
can
help
you
to
see
that
and
one
or
two
other
things
as
well
said
holmes
kindly
summon
your
men
and
will
try
five
minutes
later
three
policemen
had
assembled
in
the
hall
in
the
outhouse
you
will
find
considerable
quantity
of
straw
said
holmes
will
ask
you
to
carry
in
two
bundles
of
it
think
it
will
be
of
the
greatest
assistance
in
producing
the
witness
whom
require
thank
you
very
much
believe
you
have
some
matches
in
your
pocket
watson
now
mr
lestrade
will
ask
you
all
to
accompany
me
to
the
top
landing
as
have
said
there
was
broad
corridor
there
which
ran
outside
three
empty
bedrooms
at
one
end
of
the
corridor
we
were
all
marshalled
by
sherlock
holmes
the
constables
grinning
and
lestrade
staring
at
my
friend
with
amazement
expectation
and
derision
chasing
each
other
across
his
features
holmes
stood
before
us
with
the
air
of
conjurer
who
is
performing
trick
would
you
kindly
send
one
of
your
constables
for
two
buckets
of
water
put
the
straw
on
the
floor
here
free
from
the
wall
on
either
side
now
think
that
we
are
all
ready
lestrade
face
had
begun
to
grow
red
and
angry
don
know
whether
you
are
playing
game
with
us
mr
sherlock
holmes
said
he
if
you
know
anything
you
can
surely
say
it
without
all
this
tomfoolery
assure
you
my
good
lestrade
that
have
an
excellent
reason
for
everything
that
do
you
may
possibly
remember
that
you
chaffed
me
little
some
hours
ago
when
the
sun
seemed
on
your
side
of
the
hedge
so
you
must
not
grudge
me
little
pomp
and
ceremony
now
might
ask
you
watson
to
open
that
window
and
then
to
put
match
to
the
edge
of
the
straw
did
so
and
driven
by
the
draught
coil
of
grey
smoke
swirled
down
the
corridor
while
the
dry
straw
crackled
and
flamed
now
we
must
see
if
we
can
find
this
witness
for
you
lestrade
might
ask
you
all
to
join
in
the
cry
of
fire
now
then
one
two
three
fire
we
all
yelled
thank
you
will
trouble
you
once
again
fire
just
once
more
gentlemen
and
all
together
fire
the
shout
must
have
rung
over
norwood
it
had
hardly
died
away
when
an
amazing
thing
happened
door
suddenly
flew
open
out
of
what
appeared
to
be
solid
wall
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
and
little
wizened
man
darted
out
of
it
like
rabbit
out
of
its
burrow
capital
said
holmes
calmly
watson
bucket
of
water
over
the
straw
that
will
do
lestrade
allow
me
to
present
you
with
your
principal
missing
witness
mr
jonas
oldacre
the
detective
stared
at
the
new
comer
with
blank
amazement
the
latter
was
blinking
in
the
bright
light
of
the
corridor
and
peering
at
us
and
at
the
smouldering
fire
it
was
an
odious
face
crafty
vicious
malignant
with
shifty
light
grey
eyes
and
white
eyelashes
what
this
then
said
lestrade
at
last
what
have
you
been
doing
all
this
time
eh
oldacre
gave
an
uneasy
laugh
shrinking
back
from
the
furious
red
face
of
the
angry
detective
have
done
no
harm
no
harm
you
have
done
your
best
to
get
an
innocent
man
hanged
if
it
wasn
for
this
gentleman
here
am
not
sure
that
you
would
not
have
succeeded
the
wretched
creature
began
to
whimper
am
sure
sir
it
was
only
my
practical
joke
oh
joke
was
it
you
won
find
the
laugh
on
your
side
promise
you
take
him
down
and
keep
him
in
the
sitting
room
until
come
mr
holmes
he
continued
when
they
had
gone
could
not
speak
before
the
constables
but
don
mind
saying
in
the
presence
of
dr
watson
that
this
is
the
brightest
thing
that
you
have
done
yet
though
it
is
mystery
to
me
how
you
did
it
you
have
saved
an
innocent
man
life
and
you
have
prevented
very
grave
scandal
which
would
have
ruined
my
reputation
in
the
force
holmes
smiled
and
clapped
lestrade
upon
the
shoulder
instead
of
being
ruined
my
good
sir
you
will
find
that
your
reputation
has
been
enormously
enhanced
just
make
few
alterations
in
that
report
which
you
were
writing
and
they
will
understand
how
hard
it
is
to
throw
dust
in
the
eyes
of
inspector
lestrade
and
you
don
want
your
name
to
appear
not
at
all
the
work
is
its
own
reward
perhaps
shall
get
the
credit
also
at
some
distant
day
when
permit
my
zealous
historian
to
lay
out
his
foolscap
once
more
eh
watson
well
now
let
us
see
where
this
rat
has
been
lurking
lath
and
plaster
partition
had
been
run
across
the
passage
six
feet
from
the
end
with
door
cunningly
concealed
in
it
was
lit
within
by
slits
under
the
eaves
few
articles
of
furniture
and
supply
of
food
and
water
were
within
together
with
number
of
books
and
papers
there
the
advantage
of
being
builder
said
holmes
as
we
came
out
he
was
able
to
fix
up
his
own
little
hiding
place
without
any
confederate
save
of
course
that
precious
housekeeper
of
his
whom
should
lose
no
time
in
adding
to
your
bag
lestrade
ll
take
your
advice
but
how
did
you
know
of
this
place
mr
holmes
made
up
my
mind
that
the
fellow
was
in
hiding
in
the
house
when
paced
one
corridor
and
found
it
six
feet
shorter
than
the
corresponding
one
below
it
was
pretty
clear
where
he
was
thought
he
had
not
the
nerve
to
lie
quiet
before
an
alarm
of
fire
we
could
of
course
have
gone
in
and
taken
him
but
it
amused
me
to
make
him
reveal
himself
besides
owed
you
little
mystification
lestrade
for
your
chaff
in
the
morning
well
sir
you
certainly
got
equal
with
me
on
that
but
how
in
the
world
did
you
know
that
he
was
in
the
house
at
all
the
thumb
mark
lestrade
you
said
it
was
final
and
so
it
was
in
very
different
sense
knew
it
had
not
been
there
the
day
before
pay
good
deal
of
attention
to
matters
of
detail
as
you
may
have
observed
and
had
examined
the
hall
and
was
sure
that
the
wall
was
clear
therefore
it
had
been
put
on
during
the
night
but
how
very
simply
when
those
packets
were
sealed
up
jonas
oldacre
got
mcFarlane
to
secure
one
of
the
seals
by
putting
his
thumb
upon
the
soft
wax
it
would
be
done
so
quickly
and
so
naturally
that
dare
say
the
young
man
himself
has
no
recollection
of
it
very
likely
it
just
so
happened
and
oldacre
had
himself
no
notion
of
the
use
he
would
put
it
to
brooding
over
the
case
in
that
den
of
his
it
suddenly
struck
him
what
absolutely
damning
evidence
he
could
make
against
mcFarlane
by
using
that
thumb
mark
it
was
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
for
him
to
take
wax
impression
from
the
seal
to
moisten
it
in
as
much
blood
as
he
could
get
from
pin
prick
and
to
put
the
mark
upon
the
wall
during
the
night
either
with
his
own
hand
or
with
that
of
his
housekeeper
if
you
examine
among
those
documents
which
he
took
with
him
into
his
retreat
will
lay
you
wager
that
you
find
the
seal
with
the
thumb
mark
upon
it

wonderful
said
lestrade
wonderful
it
all
as
clear
as
crystal
as
you
put
it
but
what
is
the
object
of
this
deep
deception
mr
holmes
it
was
amusing
to
me
to
see
how
the
detective
overbearing
manner
had
changed
suddenly
to
that
of
child
asking
questions
of
its
teacher
well
don
think
that
is
very
hard
to
explain
very
deep
malicious
vindictive
person
is
the
gentleman
who
is
now
awaiting
us
downstairs
you
know
that
he
was
once
refused
by
mcFarlane
mother
you
don
told
you
that
you
should
go
to
blackheath
first
and
norwood
afterwards
well
this
injury
as
he
would
consider
it
has
rankled
in
his
wicked
scheming
brain
and
all
his
life
he
has
longed
for
vengeance
but
never
seen
his
chance
during
the
last
year
or
two
things
have
gone
against
him
secret
speculation
think
and
he
finds
himself
in
bad
way
he
determines
to
swindle
his
creditors
and
for
this
purpose
he
pays
large
cheques
to
certain
mr
cornelius
who
is
imagine
himself
under
another
name
have
not
traced
these
cheques
yet
but
have
no
doubt
that
they
were
banked
under
that
name
at
some
provincial
town
where
oldacre
from
time
to
time
led
double
existence
he
intended
to
change
his
name
altogether
draw
this
money
and
vanish
starting
life
again
elsewhere
well
that
likely
enough
it
would
strike
him
that
in
disappearing
he
might
throw
all
pursuit
off
his
track
and
at
the
same
time
have
an
ample
and
crushing
revenge
upon
his
old
sweetheart
if
he
could
give
the
impression
that
he
had
been
murdered
by
her
only
child
it
was
masterpiece
of
villainy
and
he
carried
it
out
like
master
the
idea
of
the
will
which
would
give
an
obvious
motive
for
the
crime
the
secret
visit
unknown
to
his
own
parents
the
retention
of
the
stick
the
blood
and
the
animal
remains
and
buttons
in
the
wood
pile
all
were
admirable
it
was
net
from
which
it
seemed
to
me
few
hours
ago
that
there
was
no
possible
escape
but
he
had
not
that
supreme
gift
of
the
artist
the
knowledge
of
when
to
stop
he
wished
to
improve
that
which
was
already
perfect
to
draw
the
rope
tighter
yet
round
the
neck
of
his
unfortunate
victim
and
so
he
ruined
all
let
us
descend
lestrade
there
are
just
one
or
two
questions
that
would
ask
him
the
malignant
creature
was
seated
in
his
own
parlour
with
policeman
upon
each
side
of
him
it
was
joke
my
good
sir
practical
joke
nothing
more
he
whined
incessantly
assure
you
sir
that
simply
concealed
myself
in
order
to
see
the
effect
of
my
disappearance
and
am
sure
that
you
would
not
be
so
unjust
as
to
imagine
that
would
have
allowed
any
harm
to
befall
poor
young
mr
mcFarlane
that
for
jury
to
decide
said
lestrade
anyhow
we
shall
have
you
on
charge
of
conspiracy
if
not
for
attempted
murder
and
you
ll
probably
find
that
your
creditors
will
impound
the
banking
account
of
mr
cornelius
said
holmes
the
little
man
started
and
turned
his
malignant
eyes
upon
my
friend
have
to
thank
you
for
good
deal
said
he
perhaps
ll
pay
my
debt
some
day
holmes
smiled
indulgently
fancy
that
for
some
few
years
you
will
find
your
time
very
fully
occupied
said
he
by
the
way
what
was
it
you
put
into
the
wood
pile
besides
your
old
trousers
dead
dog
or
rabbits
or
what
you
won
tell
dear
me
how
very
unkind
of
you
well
dare
say
that
couple
of
rabbits
would
account
both
for
the
blood
and
for
the
charred
ashes
if
ever
you
write
an
account
watson
you
can
make
rabbits
serve
your
turn
iii
the
adventure
of
the
dancing
men
holmes
had
been
seated
for
some
hours
in
silence
with
his
long
thin
back
curved
over
chemical
vessel
in
which
he
was
brewing
particularly
malodorous
product
his
head
was
sunk
upon
his
breast
and
he
looked
from
my
point
of
view
like
strange
lank
bird
with
dull
grey
plumage
and
black
top
knot
so
watson
said
he
suddenly
you
do
not
propose
to
invest
in
south
african
securities
gave
start
of
astonishment
accustomed
as
was
to
holmes
curious
faculties
this
sudden
intrusion
into
my
most
intimate
thoughts
was
utterly
inexplicable
how
on
earth
do
you
know
that
asked
he
wheeled
round
upon
his
stool
with
steaming
test
tube
in
his
hand
and
gleam
of
amusement
in
his
deep
set
eyes
now
watson
confess
yourself
utterly
taken
aback
said
he
am
ought
to
make
you
sign
paper
to
that
effect
why
because
in
five
minutes
you
will
say
that
it
is
all
so
absurdly
simple
am
sure
that
shall
say
nothing
of
the
kind
you
see
my
dear
watson
he
propped
his
test
tube
in
the
rack
and
began
to
lecture
with
the
air
of
professor
addressing
his
class
it
is
not
really
difficult
to
construct
series
of
inferences
each
dependent
upon
its
predecessor
and
each
simple
in
itself
if
after
doing
so
one
simply
knocks
out
all
the
central
inferences
and
presents
one
audience
with
the
starting
point
and
the
conclusion
one
may
produce
startling
though
possibly
meretricious
effect
now
it
was
not
really
difficult
by
an
inspection
of
the
groove
between
your
left
forefinger
and
thumb
to
feel
sure
that
you
did
not
propose
to
invest
your
small
capital
in
the
goldfields
see
no
connection
very
likely
not
but
can
quickly
show
you
close
connection
here
are
the
missing
links
of
the
very
simple
chain
you
had
chalk
between
your
left
finger
and
thumb
when
you
returned
from
the
club
last
night
you
put
chalk
there
when
you
play
billiards
to
steady
the
cue
you
never
play
billiards
except
with
thurston
you
told
me
four
weeks
ago
that
thurston
had
an
option
on
some
south
african
property
which
would
expire
in
month
and
which
he
desired
you
to
share
with
him
your
cheque
book
is
locked
in
my
drawer
and
you
have
not
asked
for
the
key
you
do
not
propose
to
invest
your
money
in
this
manner
how
absurdly
simple
cried
quite
so
said
he
little
nettled
every
problem
becomes
very
childish
when
once
it
is
explained
to
you
here
is
an
unexplained
one
see
what
you
can
make
of
that
friend
watson
he
tossed
sheet
of
paper
upon
the
table
and
turned
once
more
to
his
chemical
analysis
looked
with
amazement
at
the
absurd
hieroglyphics
upon
the
paper
why
holmes
it
is
child
drawing
cried
oh
that
your
idea
what
else
should
it
be
that
is
what
mr
hilton
cubitt
of
riding
thorpe
manor
norfolk
is
very
anxious
to
know
this
little
conundrum
came
by
the
first
post
and
he
was
to
follow
by
the
next
train
there
ring
at
the
bell
watson
should
not
be
very
much
surprised
if
this
were
he
heavy
step
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
and
an
instant
later
there
entered
tall
ruddy
clean
shaven
gentleman
whose
clear
eyes
and
florid
cheeks
told
of
life
led
far
from
the
fogs
of
baker
street
he
seemed
to
bring
whiff
of
his
strong
fresh
bracing
east
coast
air
with
him
as
he
entered
having
shaken
hands
with
each
of
us
he
was
about
to
sit
down
when
his
eye
rested
upon
the
paper
with
the
curious
markings
which
had
just
examined
and
left
upon
the
table
well
mr
holmes
what
do
you
make
of
these
he
cried
they
told
me
that
you
were
fond
of
queer
mysteries
and
don
think
you
can
find
queerer
one
than
that
sent
the
paper
on
ahead
so
that
you
might
have
time
to
study
it
before
came
it
is
certainly
rather
curious
production
said
holmes
at
first
sight
it
would
appear
to
be
some
childish
prank
it
consists
of
number
of
absurd
little
figures
dancing
across
the
paper
upon
which
they
are
drawn
why
should
you
attribute
any
importance
to
so
grotesque
an
object
never
should
mr
holmes
but
my
wife
does
it
is
frightening
her
to
death
she
says
nothing
but
can
see
terror
in
her
eyes
that
why
want
to
sift
the
matter
to
the
bottom
holmes
held
up
the
paper
so
that
the
sunlight
shone
full
upon
it
was
page
torn
from
note
book
the
markings
were
done
in
pencil
and
ran
in
this
way
holmes
examined
it
for
some
time
and
then
folding
it
carefully
up
he
placed
it
in
his
pocket
book
this
promises
to
be
most
interesting
and
unusual
case
said
he
you
gave
me
few
particulars
in
your
letter
mr
hilton
cubitt
but
should
be
very
much
obliged
if
you
would
kindly
go
over
it
all
again
for
the
benefit
of
my
friend
dr
watson
not
much
of
story
teller
said
our
visitor
nervously
clasping
and
unclasping
his
great
strong
hands
you
ll
just
ask
me
anything
that
don
make
clear
ll
begin
at
the
time
of
my
marriage
last
year
but
want
to
say
first
of
all
that
though
not
rich
man
my
people
have
been
at
ridling
thorpe
for
matter
of
five
centuries
and
there
is
no
better
known
family
in
the
county
of
norfolk
last
year
came
up
to
london
for
the
jubilee
and
stopped
at
boarding
house
in
russell
square
because
parker
the
vicar
of
our
parish
was
staying
in
it
there
was
an
american
young
lady
there
patrick
was
the
name
elsie
patrick
in
some
way
we
became
friends
until
before
my
month
was
up
was
as
much
in
love
as
man
could
be
we
were
quietly
married
at
registry
office
and
we
returned
to
norfolk
wedded
couple
you
ll
think
it
very
mad
mr
holmes
that
man
of
good
old
family
should
marry
wife
in
this
fashion
knowing
nothing
of
her
past
or
of
her
people
but
if
you
saw
her
and
knew
her
it
would
help
you
to
understand

she
was
very
straight
about
it
was
elsie
can
say
that
she
did
not
give
me
every
chance
of
getting
out
of
it
if
wished
to
do
so
have
had
some
very
disagreeable
associations
in
my
life
said
she
wish
to
forget
all
about
them
would
rather
never
allude
to
the
past
for
it
is
very
painful
to
me
if
you
take
me
hilton
you
will
take
woman
who
has
nothing
that
she
need
be
personally
ashamed
of
but
you
will
have
to
be
content
with
my
word
for
it
and
to
allow
me
to
be
silent
as
to
all
that
passed
up
to
the
time
when
became
yours
if
these
conditions
are
too
hard
then
go
back
to
norfolk
and
leave
me
to
the
lonely
life
in
which
you
found
me
it
was
only
the
day
before
our
wedding
that
she
said
those
very
words
to
me
told
her
that
was
content
to
take
her
on
her
own
terms
and
have
been
as
good
as
my
word
well
we
have
been
married
now
for
year
and
very
happy
we
have
been
but
about
month
ago
at
the
end
of
june
saw
for
the
first
time
signs
of
trouble
one
day
my
wife
received
letter
from
america
saw
the
american
stamp
she
turned
deadly
white
read
the
letter
and
threw
it
into
the
fire
she
made
no
allusion
to
it
afterwards
and
made
none
for
promise
is
promise
but
she
has
never
known
an
easy
hour
from
that
moment
there
is
always
look
of
fear
upon
her
face
look
as
if
she
were
waiting
and
expecting
she
would
do
better
to
trust
me
she
would
find
that
was
her
best
friend
but
until
she
speaks
can
say
nothing
mind
you
she
is
truthful
woman
mr
holmes
and
whatever
trouble
there
may
have
been
in
her
past
life
it
has
been
no
fault
of
hers
am
only
simple
norfolk
squire
but
there
is
not
man
in
england
who
ranks
his
family
honour
more
highly
than
do
she
knows
it
well
and
she
knew
it
well
before
she
married
me
she
would
never
bring
any
stain
upon
it
of
that
am
sure
well
now
come
to
the
queer
part
of
my
story
about
week
ago
it
was
the
tuesday
of
last
week
found
on
one
of
the
window
sills
number
of
absurd
little
dancing
figures
like
these
upon
the
paper
they
were
scrawled
with
chalk
thought
that
it
was
the
stable
boy
who
had
drawn
them
but
the
lad
swore
he
knew
nothing
about
it
anyhow
they
had
come
there
during
the
night
had
them
washed
out
and
only
mentioned
the
matter
to
my
wife
afterwards
to
my
surprise
she
took
it
very
seriously
and
begged
me
if
any
more
came
to
let
her
see
them
none
did
come
for
week
and
then
yesterday
morning
found
this
paper
lying
on
the
sun
dial
in
the
garden
showed
it
to
elsie
and
down
she
dropped
in
dead
faint
since
then
she
has
looked
like
woman
in
dream
half
dazed
and
with
terror
always
lurking
in
her
eyes
it
was
then
that
wrote
and
sent
the
paper
to
you
mr
holmes
it
was
not
thing
that
could
take
to
the
police
for
they
would
have
laughed
at
me
but
you
will
tell
me
what
to
do
am
not
rich
man
but
if
there
is
any
danger
threatening
my
little
woman
would
spend
my
last
copper
to
shield
her
he
was
fine
creature
this
man
of
the
old
english
soil
simple
straight
and
gentle
with
his
great
earnest
blue
eyes
and
broad
comely
face
his
love
for
his
wife
and
his
trust
in
her
shone
in
his
features
holmes
had
listened
to
his
story
with
the
utmost
attention
and
now
he
sat
for
some
time
in
silent
thought
don
you
think
mr
cubitt
said
he
at
last
that
your
best
plan
would
be
to
make
direct
appeal
to
your
wife
and
to
ask
her
to
share
her
secret
with
you
hilton
cubitt
shook
his
massive
head
promise
is
promise
mr
holmes
if
elsie
wished
to
tell
me
she
would
if
not
it
is
not
for
me
to
force
her
confidence
but
am
justified
in
taking
my
own
line
and
will
then
will
help
you
with
all
my
heart
in
the
first
place
have
you
heard
of
any
strangers
being
seen
in
your
neighbourhood
no
presume
that
it
is
very
quiet
place
any
fresh
face
would
cause
comment
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
yes
but
we
have
several
small
watering
places
not
very
far
away
and
the
farmers
take
in
lodgers
these
hieroglyphics
have
evidently
meaning
if
it
is
purely
arbitrary
one
it
may
be
impossible
for
us
to
solve
it
if
on
the
other
hand
it
is
systematic
have
no
doubt
that
we
shall
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
but
this
particular
sample
is
so
short
that
can
do
nothing
and
the
facts
which
you
have
brought
me
are
so
indefinite
that
we
have
no
basis
for
an
investigation
would
suggest
that
you
return
to
norfolk
that
you
keep
keen
look
out
and
that
you
take
an
exact
copy
of
any
fresh
dancing
men
which
may
appear
it
is
thousand
pities
that
we
have
not
reproduction
of
those
which
were
done
in
chalk
upon
the
window
sill
make
discreet
inquiry
also
as
to
any
strangers
in
the
neighbourhood
when
you
have
collected
some
fresh
evidence
come
to
me
again
that
is
the
best
advice
which
can
give
you
mr
hilton
cubitt
if
there
are
any
pressing
fresh
developments
shall
be
always
ready
to
run
down
and
see
you
in
your
norfolk
home
the
interview
left
sherlock
holmes
very
thoughtful
and
several
times
in
the
next
few
days
saw
him
take
his
slip
of
paper
from
his
note
book
and
look
long
and
earnestly
at
the
curious
figures
inscribed
upon
it
he
made
no
allusion
to
the
affair
however
until
one
afternoon
fortnight
or
so
later
was
going
out
when
he
called
me
back
you
had
better
stay
here
watson
why
because
had
wire
from
hilton
cubitt
this
morning
you
remember
hilton
cubitt
of
the
dancing
men
he
was
to
reach
liverpool
street
at
one
twenty
he
may
be
here
at
any
moment
gather
from
his
wire
that
there
have
been
some
new
incidents
of
importance
we
had
not
long
to
wait
for
our
norfolk
squire
came
straight
from
the
station
as
fast
as
hansom
could
bring
him
he
was
looking
worried
and
depressed
with
tired
eyes
and
lined
forehead
it
getting
on
my
nerves
this
business
mr
holmes
said
he
as
he
sank
like
wearied
man
into
an
arm
chair
it
bad
enough
to
feel
that
you
are
surrounded
by
unseen
unknown
folk
who
have
some
kind
of
design
upon
you
but
when
in
addition
to
that
you
know
that
it
is
just
killing
your
wife
by
inches
then
it
becomes
as
much
as
flesh
and
blood
can
endure
she
wearing
away
under
it
just
wearing
away
before
my
eyes
has
she
said
anything
yet
no
mr
holmes
she
has
not
and
yet
there
have
been
times
when
the
poor
girl
has
wanted
to
speak
and
yet
could
not
quite
bring
herself
to
take
the
plunge
have
tried
to
help
her
but
dare
say
did
it
clumsily
and
scared
her
off
from
it
she
has
spoken
about
my
old
family
and
our
reputation
in
the
county
and
our
pride
in
our
unsullied
honour
and
always
felt
it
was
leading
to
the
point
but
somehow
it
turned
off
before
we
got
there
but
you
have
found
out
something
for
yourself
good
deal
mr
holmes
have
several
fresh
dancing
men
pictures
for
you
to
examine
and
what
is
more
important
have
seen
the
fellow
what
the
man
who
draws
them
yes
saw
him
at
his
work
but
will
tell
you
everything
in
order
when
got
back
after
my
visit
to
you
the
very
first
thing
saw
next
morning
was
fresh
crop
of
dancing
men
they
had
been
drawn
in
chalk
upon
the
black
wooden
door
of
the
tool
house
which
stands
beside
the
lawn
in
full
view
of
the
front
windows
took
an
exact
copy
and
here
it
is
he
unfolded
paper
and
laid
it
upon
the
table
here
is
copy
of
the
hieroglyphics
excellent
said
holmes
excellent
pray
continue
when
had
taken
the
copy
rubbed
out
the
marks
but
two
mornings
later
fresh
inscription
had
appeared
have
copy
of
it
here
holmes
rubbed
his
hands
and
chuckled
with
delight
our
material
is
rapidly
accumulating
said
he
three
days
later
message
was
left
scrawled
upon
paper
and
placed
under
pebble
upon
the
sun
dial
here
it
is
the
characters
are
as
you
see
exactly
the
same
as
the
last
one
after
that
determined
to
lie
in
wait
so
got
out
my
revolver
and
sat
up
in
my
study
which
overlooks
the
lawn
and
garden
about
two
in
the
morning
was
seated
by
the
window
all
being
dark
save
for
the
moonlight
outside
when
heard
steps
behind
me
and
there
was
my
wife
in
her
dressing
gown
she
implored
me
to
come
to
bed
told
her
frankly
that
wished
to
see
who
it
was
who
played
such
absurd
tricks
upon
us
she
answered
that
it
was
some
senseless
practical
joke
and
that
should
not
take
any
notice
of
it
if
it
really
annoys
you
hilton
we
might
go
and
travel
you
and
so
avoid
this
nuisance
what
be
driven
out
of
our
own
house
by
practical
joker
said
why
we
should
have
the
whole
county
laughing
at
us
well
come
to
bed
said
she
and
we
can
discuss
it
in
the
morning
suddenly
as
she
spoke
saw
her
white
face
grow
whiter
yet
in
the
moonlight
and
her
hand
tightened
upon
my
shoulder
something
was
moving
in
the
shadow
of
the
tool
house
saw
dark
creeping
figure
which
crawled
round
the
corner
and
squatted
in
front
of
the
door
seizing
my
pistol
was
rushing
out
when
my
wife
threw
her
arms
round
me
and
held
me
with
convulsive
strength
tried
to
throw
her
off
but
she
clung
to
me
most
desperately
at
last
got
clear
but
by
the
time
had
opened
the
door
and
reached
the
house
the
creature
was
gone
he
had
left
trace
of
his
presence
however
for
there
on
the
door
was
the
very
same
arrangement
of
dancing
men
which
had
already
twice
appeared
and
which
have
copied
on
that
paper
there
was
no
other
sign
of
the
fellow
anywhere
though
ran
all
over
the
grounds
and
yet
the
amazing
thing
is
that
he
must
have
been
there
all
the
time
for
when
examined
the
door
again
in
the
morning
he
had
scrawled
some
more
of
his
pictures
under
the
line
which
had
already
seen

have
you
that
fresh
drawing
yes
it
is
very
short
but
made
copy
of
it
and
here
it
is
again
he
produced
paper
the
new
dance
was
in
this
form
tell
me
said
holmes
and
could
see
by
his
eyes
that
he
was
much
excited
was
this
mere
addition
to
the
first
or
did
it
appear
to
be
entirely
separate
it
was
on
different
panel
of
the
door
excellent
this
is
far
the
most
important
of
all
for
our
purpose
it
fills
me
with
hopes
now
mr
hilton
cubitt
please
continue
your
most
interesting
statement
have
nothing
more
to
say
mr
holmes
except
that
was
angry
with
my
wife
that
night
for
having
held
me
back
when
might
have
caught
the
skulking
rascal
she
said
that
she
feared
that
might
come
to
harm
for
an
instant
it
had
crossed
my
mind
that
perhaps
what
she
really
feared
was
that
he
might
come
to
harm
for
could
not
doubt
that
she
knew
who
this
man
was
and
what
he
meant
by
these
strange
signals
but
there
is
tone
in
my
wife
voice
mr
holmes
and
look
in
her
eyes
which
forbid
doubt
and
am
sure
that
it
was
indeed
my
own
safety
that
was
in
her
mind
there
the
whole
case
and
now
want
your
advice
as
to
what
ought
to
do
my
own
inclination
is
to
put
half
dozen
of
my
farm
lads
in
the
shrubbery
and
when
this
fellow
comes
again
to
give
him
such
hiding
that
he
will
leave
us
in
peace
for
the
future
fear
it
is
too
deep
case
for
such
simple
remedies
said
holmes
how
long
can
you
stay
in
london
must
go
back
to
day
would
not
leave
my
wife
alone
all
night
for
anything
she
is
very
nervous
and
begged
me
to
come
back
dare
say
you
are
right
but
if
you
could
have
stopped
might
possibly
have
been
able
to
return
with
you
in
day
or
two
meanwhile
you
will
leave
me
these
papers
and
think
that
it
is
very
likely
that
shall
be
able
to
pay
you
visit
shortly
and
to
throw
some
light
upon
your
case
sherlock
holmes
preserved
his
calm
professional
manner
until
our
visitor
had
left
us
although
it
was
easy
for
me
who
knew
him
so
well
to
see
that
he
was
profoundly
excited
the
moment
that
hilton
cubitt
broad
back
had
disappeared
through
the
door
my
comrade
rushed
to
the
table
laid
out
all
the
slips
of
paper
containing
dancing
men
in
front
of
him
and
threw
himself
into
an
intricate
and
elaborate
calculation
for
two
hours
watched
him
as
he
covered
sheet
after
sheet
of
paper
with
figures
and
letters
so
completely
absorbed
in
his
task
that
he
had
evidently
forgotten
my
presence
sometimes
he
was
making
progress
and
whistled
and
sang
at
his
work
sometimes
he
was
puzzled
and
would
sit
for
long
spells
with
furrowed
brow
and
vacant
eye
finally
he
sprang
from
his
chair
with
cry
of
satisfaction
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
rubbing
his
hands
together
then
he
wrote
long
telegram
upon
cable
form
if
my
answer
to
this
is
as
hope
you
will
have
very
pretty
case
to
add
to
your
collection
watson
said
he
expect
that
we
shall
be
able
to
go
down
to
norfolk
to
morrow
and
to
take
our
friend
some
very
definite
news
as
to
the
secret
of
his
annoyance
confess
that
was
filled
with
curiosity
but
was
aware
that
holmes
liked
to
make
his
disclosures
at
his
own
time
and
in
his
own
way
so
waited
until
it
should
suit
him
to
take
me
into
his
confidence
but
there
was
delay
in
that
answering
telegram
and
two
days
of
impatience
followed
during
which
holmes
pricked
up
his
ears
at
every
ring
of
the
bell
on
the
evening
of
the
second
there
came
letter
from
hilton
cubitt
all
was
quiet
with
him
save
that
long
inscription
had
appeared
that
morning
upon
the
pedestal
of
the
sun
dial
he
inclosed
copy
of
it
which
is
here
reproduced
holmes
bent
over
this
grotesque
frieze
for
some
minutes
and
then
suddenly
sprang
to
his
feet
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
dismay
his
face
was
haggard
with
anxiety
we
have
let
this
affair
go
far
enough
said
he
is
there
train
to
north
walsham
to
night
turned
up
the
time
table
the
last
had
just
gone
then
we
shall
breakfast
early
and
take
the
very
first
in
the
morning
said
holmes
our
presence
is
most
urgently
needed
ah
here
is
our
expected
cablegram
one
moment
mrs
hudson
there
may
be
an
answer
no
that
is
quite
as
expected
this
message
makes
it
even
more
essential
that
we
should
not
lose
an
hour
in
letting
hilton
cubitt
know
how
matters
stand
for
it
is
singular
and
dangerous
web
in
which
our
simple
norfolk
squire
is
entangled
so
indeed
it
proved
and
as
come
to
the
dark
conclusion
of
story
which
had
seemed
to
me
to
be
only
childish
and
bizarre
experience
once
again
the
dismay
and
horror
with
which
was
filled
would
that
had
some
brighter
ending
to
communicate
to
my
readers
but
these
are
the
chronicles
of
fact
and
must
follow
to
their
dark
crisis
the
strange
chain
of
events
which
for
some
days
made
ridling
thorpe
manor
household
word
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
england
we
had
hardly
alighted
at
north
walsham
and
mentioned
the
name
of
our
destination
when
the
station
master
hurried
towards
us
suppose
that
you
are
the
detectives
from
london
said
he
look
of
annoyance
passed
over
holmes
face
what
makes
you
think
such
thing
because
inspector
martin
from
norwich
has
just
passed
through
but
maybe
you
are
the
surgeons
she
not
dead
or
wasn
by
last
accounts
you
may
be
in
time
to
save
her
yet
though
it
be
for
the
gallows
holmes
brow
was
dark
with
anxiety
we
are
going
to
ridling
thorpe
manor
said
he
but
we
have
heard
nothing
of
what
has
passed
there
it
terrible
business
said
the
station
master
they
are
shot
both
mr
hilton
cubitt
and
his
wife
she
shot
him
and
then
herself
so
the
servants
say
he
dead
and
her
life
is
despaired
of
dear
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
the
county
of
norfolk
and
one
of
the
most
honoured
without
word
holmes
hurried
to
carriage
and
during
the
long
seven
miles
drive
he
never
opened
his
mouth
seldom
have
seen
him
so
utterly
despondent
he
had
been
uneasy
during
all
our
journey
from
town
and
had
observed
that
he
had
turned
over
the
morning
papers
with
anxious
attention
but
now
this
sudden
realization
of
his
worst
fears
left
him
in
blank
melancholy
he
leaned
back
in
his
seat
lost
in
gloomy
speculation
yet
there
was
much
around
to
interest
us
for
we
were
passing
through
as
singular
country
side
as
any
in
england
where
few
scattered
cottages
represented
the
population
of
to
day
while
on
every
hand
enormous
square
towered
churches
bristled
up
from
the
flat
green
landscape
and
told
of
the
glory
and
prosperity
of
old
east
anglia
at
last
the
violet
rim
of
the
german
ocean
appeared
over
the
green
edge
of
the
norfolk
coast
and
the
driver
pointed
with
his
whip
to
two
old
brick
and
timber
gables
which
projected
from
grove
of
trees
that
ridling
thorpe
manor
said
he
as
we
drove
up
to
the
porticoed
front
door
observed
in
front
of
it
beside
the
tennis
lawn
the
black
tool
house
and
the
pedestalled
sun
dial
with
which
we
had
such
strange
associations
dapper
little
man
with
quick
alert
manner
and
waxed
moustache
had
just
descended
from
high
dog
cart
he
introduced
himself
as
inspector
martin
of
the
norfolk
constabulary
and
he
was
considerably
astonished
when
he
heard
the
name
of
my
companion
why
mr
holmes
the
crime
was
only
committed
at
three
this
morning
how
could
you
hear
of
it
in
london
and
get
to
the
spot
as
soon
as
anticipated
it
came
in
the
hope
of
preventing
it
then
you
must
have
important
evidence
of
which
we
are
ignorant
for
they
were
said
to
be
most
united
couple
have
only
the
evidence
of
the
dancing
men
said
holmes
will
explain
the
matter
to
you
later
meanwhile
since
it
is
too
late
to
prevent
this
tragedy
am
very
anxious
that
should
use
the
knowledge
which
possess
in
order
to
ensure
that
justice
be
done
will
you
associate
me
in
your
investigation
or
will
you
prefer
that
should
act
independently
should
be
proud
to
feel
that
we
were
acting
together
mr
holmes
said
the
inspector
earnestly
in
that
case
should
be
glad
to
hear
the
evidence
and
to
examine
the
premises
without
an
instant
of
unnecessary
delay
inspector
martin
had
the
good
sense
to
allow
my
friend
to
do
things
in
his
own
fashion
and
contented
himself
with
carefully
noting
the
results
the
local
surgeon
an
old
white
haired
man
had
just
come
down
from
mrs
hilton
cubitt
room
and
he
reported
that
her
injuries
were
serious
but
not
necessarily
fatal
the
bullet
had
passed
through
the
front
of
her
brain
and
it
would
probably
be
some
time
before
she
could
regain
consciousness
on
the
question
of
whether
she
had
been
shot
or
had
shot
herself
he
would
not
venture
to
express
any
decided
opinion
certainly
the
bullet
had
been
discharged
at
very
close
quarters
there
was
only
the
one
pistol
found
in
the
room
two
barrels
of
which
had
been
emptied
mr
hilton
cubitt
had
been
shot
through
the
heart
it
was
equally
conceivable
that
he
had
shot
her
and
then
himself
or
that
she
had
been
the
criminal
for
the
revolver
lay
upon
the
floor
midway
between
them

has
he
been
moved
asked
holmes
we
have
moved
nothing
except
the
lady
we
could
not
leave
her
lying
wounded
upon
the
floor
how
long
have
you
been
here
doctor
since
four
clock
anyone
else
yes
the
constable
here
and
you
have
touched
nothing
you
have
acted
with
great
discretion
who
sent
for
you
the
housemaid
saunders
was
it
she
who
gave
the
alarm
she
and
mrs
king
the
cook
where
are
they
now
in
the
kitchen
believe
then
think
we
had
better
hear
their
story
at
once
the
old
hall
oak
panelled
and
high
windowed
had
been
turned
into
court
of
investigation
holmes
sat
in
great
old
fashioned
chair
his
inexorable
eyes
gleaming
out
of
his
haggard
face
could
read
in
them
set
purpose
to
devote
his
life
to
this
quest
until
the
client
whom
he
had
failed
to
save
should
at
last
be
avenged
the
trim
inspector
martin
the
old
grey
headed
country
doctor
myself
and
stolid
village
policeman
made
up
the
rest
of
that
strange
company
the
two
women
told
their
story
clearly
enough
they
had
been
aroused
from
their
sleep
by
the
sound
of
an
explosion
which
had
been
followed
minute
later
by
second
one
they
slept
in
adjoining
rooms
and
mrs
king
had
rushed
in
to
saunders
together
they
had
descended
the
stairs
the
door
of
the
study
was
open
and
candle
was
burning
upon
the
table
their
master
lay
upon
his
face
in
the
centre
of
the
room
he
was
quite
dead
near
the
window
his
wife
was
crouching
her
head
leaning
against
the
wall
she
was
horribly
wounded
and
the
side
of
her
face
was
red
with
blood
she
breathed
heavily
but
was
incapable
of
saying
anything
the
passage
as
well
as
the
room
was
full
of
smoke
and
the
smell
of
powder
the
window
was
certainly
shut
and
fastened
upon
the
inside
both
women
were
positive
upon
the
point
they
had
at
once
sent
for
the
doctor
and
for
the
constable
then
with
the
aid
of
the
groom
and
the
stable
boy
they
had
conveyed
their
injured
mistress
to
her
room
both
she
and
her
husband
had
occupied
the
bed
she
was
clad
in
her
dress
he
in
his
dressing
gown
over
his
night
clothes
nothing
had
been
moved
in
the
study
so
far
as
they
knew
there
had
never
been
any
quarrel
between
husband
and
wife
they
had
always
looked
upon
them
as
very
united
couple
these
were
the
main
points
of
the
servants
evidence
in
answer
to
inspector
martin
they
were
clear
that
every
door
was
fastened
upon
the
inside
and
that
no
one
could
have
escaped
from
the
house
in
answer
to
holmes
they
both
remembered
that
they
were
conscious
of
the
smell
of
powder
from
the
moment
that
they
ran
out
of
their
rooms
upon
the
top
floor
commend
that
fact
very
carefully
to
your
attention
said
holmes
to
his
professional
colleague
and
now
think
that
we
are
in
position
to
undertake
thorough
examination
of
the
room
the
study
proved
to
be
small
chamber
lined
on
three
sides
with
books
and
with
writing
table
facing
an
ordinary
window
which
looked
out
upon
the
garden
our
first
attention
was
given
to
the
body
of
the
unfortunate
squire
whose
huge
frame
lay
stretched
across
the
room
his
disordered
dress
showed
that
he
had
been
hastily
aroused
from
sleep
the
bullet
had
been
fired
at
him
from
the
front
and
had
remained
in
his
body
after
penetrating
the
heart
his
death
had
certainly
been
instantaneous
and
painless
there
was
no
powder
marking
either
upon
his
dressing
gown
or
on
his
hands
according
to
the
country
surgeon
the
lady
had
stains
upon
her
face
but
none
upon
her
hand
the
absence
of
the
latter
means
nothing
though
its
presence
may
mean
everything
said
holmes
unless
the
powder
from
badly
fitting
cartridge
happens
to
spurt
backwards
one
may
fire
many
shots
without
leaving
sign
would
suggest
that
mr
cubitt
body
may
now
be
removed
suppose
doctor
you
have
not
recovered
the
bullet
which
wounded
the
lady
serious
operation
will
be
necessary
before
that
can
be
done
but
there
are
still
four
cartridges
in
the
revolver
two
have
been
fired
and
two
wounds
inflicted
so
that
each
bullet
can
be
accounted
for
so
it
would
seem
said
holmes
perhaps
you
can
account
also
for
the
bullet
which
has
so
obviously
struck
the
edge
of
the
window
he
had
turned
suddenly
and
his
long
thin
finger
was
pointing
to
hole
which
had
been
drilled
right
through
the
lower
window
sash
about
an
inch
above
the
bottom
by
george
cried
the
inspector
how
ever
did
you
see
that
because
looked
for
it
wonderful
said
the
country
doctor
you
are
certainly
right
sir
then
third
shot
has
been
fired
and
therefore
third
person
must
have
been
present
but
who
could
that
have
been
and
how
could
he
have
got
away
that
is
the
problem
which
we
are
now
about
to
solve
said
sherlock
holmes
you
remember
inspector
martin
when
the
servants
said
that
on
leaving
their
room
they
were
at
once
conscious
of
smell
of
powder
remarked
that
the
point
was
an
extremely
important
one
yes
sir
but
confess
did
not
quite
follow
you
it
suggested
that
at
the
time
of
the
firing
the
window
as
well
as
the
door
of
the
room
had
been
open
otherwise
the
fumes
of
powder
could
not
have
been
blown
so
rapidly
through
the
house
draught
in
the
room
was
necessary
for
that
both
door
and
window
were
only
open
for
very
short
time
however
how
do
you
prove
that
because
the
candle
has
not
guttered
capital
cried
the
inspector
capital
feeling
sure
that
the
window
had
been
open
at
the
time
of
the
tragedy
conceived
that
there
might
have
been
third
person
in
the
affair
who
stood
outside
this
opening
and
fired
through
it
any
shot
directed
at
this
person
might
hit
the
sash
looked
and
there
sure
enough
was
the
bullet
mark
but
how
came
the
window
to
be
shut
and
fastened
the
woman
first
instinct
would
be
to
shut
and
fasten
the
window
but
halloa
what
is
this
it
was
lady
hand
bag
which
stood
upon
the
study
table
trim
little
hand
bag
of
crocodile
skin
and
silver
holmes
opened
it
and
turned
the
contents
out
there
were
twenty
fifty
pound
notes
of
the
bank
of
england
held
together
by
an
india
rubber
band
nothing
else
this
must
be
preserved
for
it
will
figure
in
the
trial
said
holmes
as
he
handed
the
bag
with
its
contents
to
the
inspector
it
is
now
necessary
that
we
should
try
to
throw
some
light
upon
this
third
bullet
which
has
clearly
from
the
splintering
of
the
wood
been
fired
from
inside
the
room
should
like
to
see
mrs
king
the
cook
again
you
said
mrs
king
that
you
were
awakened
by
loud
explosion
when
you
said
that
did
you
mean
that
it
seemed
to
you
to
be
louder
than
the
second
one
well
sir
it
wakened
me
from
my
sleep
and
so
it
is
hard
to
judge
but
it
did
seem
very
loud
you
don
think
that
it
might
have
been
two
shots
fired
almost
at
the
same
instant
am
sure
couldn
say
sir
believe
that
it
was
undoubtedly
so
rather
think
inspector
martin
that
we
have
now
exhausted
all
that
this
room
can
teach
us
if
you
will
kindly
step
round
with
me
we
shall
see
what
fresh
evidence
the
garden
has
to
offer
flower
bed
extended
up
to
the
study
window
and
we
all
broke
into
an
exclamation
as
we
approached
it
the
flowers
were
trampled
down
and
the
soft
soil
was
imprinted
all
over
with
footmarks
large
masculine
feet
they
were
with
peculiarly
long
sharp
toes
holmes
hunted
about
among
the
grass
and
leaves
like
retriever
after
wounded
bird
then
with
cry
of
satisfaction
he
bent
forward
and
picked
up
little
brazen
cylinder
thought
so
said
he
the
revolver
had
an
ejector
and
here
is
the
third
cartridge
really
think
inspector
martin
that
our
case
is
almost
complete
the
country
inspector
face
had
shown
his
intense
amazement
at
the
rapid
and
masterful
progress
of
holmes
investigation
at
first
he
had
shown
some
disposition
to
assert
his
own
position
but
now
he
was
overcome
with
admiration
and
ready
to
follow
without
question
wherever
holmes
led
whom
do
you
suspect
he
asked
ll
go
into
that
later
there
are
several
points
in
this
problem
which
have
not
been
able
to
explain
to
you
yet
now
that
have
got
so
far
had
best
proceed
on
my
own
lines
and
then
clear
the
whole
matter
up
once
and
for
all
just
as
you
wish
mr
holmes
so
long
as
we
get
our
man
have
no
desire
to
make
mysteries
but
it
is
impossible
at
the
moment
of
action
to
enter
into
long
and
complex
explanations
have
the
threads
of
this
affair
all
in
my
hand
even
if
this
lady
should
never
recover
consciousness
we
can
still
reconstruct
the
events
of
last
night
and
ensure
that
justice
be
done
first
of
all
wish
to
know
whether
there
is
any
inn
in
this
neighbourhood
known
as
elrige
the
servants
were
cross
questioned
but
none
of
them
had
heard
of
such
place
the
stable
boy
threw
light
upon
the
matter
by
remembering
that
farmer
of
that
name
lived
some
miles
off
in
the
direction
of
east

is
it
lonely
farm
very
lonely
sir
perhaps
they
have
not
heard
yet
of
all
that
happened
here
during
the
night
maybe
not
sir
holmes
thought
for
little
and
then
curious
smile
played
over
his
face
saddle
horse
my
lad
said
he
shall
wish
you
to
take
note
to
elrige
farm
he
took
from
his
pocket
the
various
slips
of
the
dancing
men
with
these
in
front
of
him
he
worked
for
some
time
at
the
study
table
finally
he
handed
note
to
the
boy
with
directions
to
put
it
into
the
hands
of
the
person
to
whom
it
was
addressed
and
especially
to
answer
no
questions
of
any
sort
which
might
be
put
to
him
saw
the
outside
of
the
note
addressed
in
straggling
irregular
characters
very
unlike
holmes
usual
precise
hand
it
was
consigned
to
mr
abe
slaney
elrige
farm
east
ruston
norfolk
think
inspector
holmes
remarked
that
you
would
do
well
to
telegraph
for
an
escort
as
if
my
calculations
prove
to
be
correct
you
may
have
particularly
dangerous
prisoner
to
convey
to
the
county
gaol
the
boy
who
takes
this
note
could
no
doubt
forward
your
telegram
if
there
is
an
afternoon
train
to
town
watson
think
we
should
do
well
to
take
it
as
have
chemical
analysis
of
some
interest
to
finish
and
this
investigation
draws
rapidly
to
close
when
the
youth
had
been
dispatched
with
the
note
sherlock
holmes
gave
his
instructions
to
the
servants
if
any
visitor
were
to
call
asking
for
mrs
hilton
cubitt
no
information
should
be
given
as
to
her
condition
but
he
was
to
be
shown
at
once
into
the
drawing
room
he
impressed
these
points
upon
them
with
the
utmost
earnestness
finally
he
led
the
way
into
the
drawing
room
with
the
remark
that
the
business
was
now
out
of
our
hands
and
that
we
must
while
away
the
time
as
best
we
might
until
we
could
see
what
was
in
store
for
us
the
doctor
had
departed
to
his
patients
and
only
the
inspector
and
myself
remained
think
that
can
help
you
to
pass
an
hour
in
an
interesting
and
profitable
manner
said
holmes
drawing
his
chair
up
to
the
table
and
spreading
out
in
front
of
him
the
various
papers
upon
which
were
recorded
the
antics
of
the
dancing
men
as
to
you
friend
watson
owe
you
every
atonement
for
having
allowed
your
natural
curiosity
to
remain
so
long
unsatisfied
to
you
inspector
the
whole
incident
may
appeal
as
remarkable
professional
study
must
tell
you
first
of
all
the
interesting
circumstances
connected
with
the
previous
consultations
which
mr
hilton
cubitt
has
had
with
me
in
baker
street
he
then
shortly
recapitulated
the
facts
which
have
already
been
recorded
have
here
in
front
of
me
these
singular
productions
at
which
one
might
smile
had
they
not
proved
themselves
to
be
the
fore
runners
of
so
terrible
tragedy
am
fairly
familiar
with
all
forms
of
secret
writings
and
am
myself
the
author
of
trifling
monograph
upon
the
subject
in
which
analyze
one
hundred
and
sixty
separate
ciphers
but
confess
that
this
is
entirely
new
to
me
the
object
of
those
who
invented
the
system
has
apparently
been
to
conceal
that
these
characters
convey
message
and
to
give
the
idea
that
they
are
the
mere
random
sketches
of
children
having
once
recognised
however
that
the
symbols
stood
for
letters
and
having
applied
the
rules
which
guide
us
in
all
forms
of
secret
writings
the
solution
was
easy
enough
the
first
message
submitted
to
me
was
so
short
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
do
more
than
to
say
with
some
confidence
that
the
symbol
stood
for
as
you
are
aware
is
the
most
common
letter
in
the
english
alphabet
and
it
predominates
to
so
marked
an
extent
that
even
in
short
sentence
one
would
expect
to
find
it
most
often
out
of
fifteen
symbols
in
the
first
message
four
were
the
same
so
it
was
reasonable
to
set
this
down
as
it
is
true
that
in
some
cases
the
figure
was
bearing
flag
and
in
some
cases
not
but
it
was
probable
from
the
way
in
which
the
flags
were
distributed
that
they
were
used
to
break
the
sentence
up
into
words
accepted
this
as
hypothesis
and
noted
that
was
represented
by
but
now
came
the
real
difficulty
of
the
inquiry
the
order
of
the
english
letters
after
is
by
no
means
well
marked
and
any
preponderance
which
may
be
shown
in
an
average
of
printed
sheet
may
be
reversed
in
single
short
sentence
speaking
roughly
and
are
the
numerical
order
in
which
letters
occur
but
and
are
very
nearly
abreast
of
each
other
and
it
would
be
an
endless
task
to
try
each
combination
until
meaning
was
arrived
at
therefore
waited
for
fresh
material
in
my
second
interview
with
mr
hilton
cubitt
he
was
able
to
give
me
two
other
short
sentences
and
one
message
which
appeared
since
there
was
no
flag
to
be
single
word
here
are
the
symbols
now
in
the
single
word
have
already
got
the
two
coming
second
and
fourth
in
word
of
five
letters
it
might
be
sever
or
lever
or
never
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
latter
as
reply
to
an
appeal
is
far
the
most
probable
and
the
circumstances
pointed
to
its
being
reply
written
by
the
lady
accepting
it
as
correct
we
are
now
able
to
say
that
the
symbols
stand
respectively
for
and
even
now
was
in
considerable
difficulty
but
happy
thought
put
me
in
possession
of
several
other
letters
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
these
appeals
came
as
expected
from
someone
who
had
been
intimate
with
the
lady
in
her
early
life
combination
which
contained
two
with
three
letters
between
might
very
well
stand
for
the
name
elsie
on
examination
found
that
such
combination
formed
the
termination
of
the
message
which
was
three
times
repeated
it
was
certainly
some
appeal
to
elsie
in
this
way
had
got
my
and
but
what
appeal
could
it
be
there
were
only
four
letters
in
the
word
which
preceded
elsie
and
it
ended
in
surely
the
word
must
be
come
tried
all
other
four
letters
ending
in
but
could
find
none
to
fit
the
case
so
now
was
in
possession
of
and
was
in
position
to
attack
the
first
message
once
more
dividing
it
into
words
and
putting
dots
for
each
symbol
which
was
still
unknown
so
treated
it
worked
out
in
this
fashion
ere…E
sl
ne
now
the
first
letter
can
only
be
which
is
most
useful
discovery
since
it
occurs
no
fewer
than
three
times
in
this
short
sentence
and
the
is
also
apparent
in
the
second
word
now
it
becomes
am
here
slane
or
filling
in
the
obvious
vacancies
in
the
name
am
here
abe
slaney
had
so
many
letters
now
that
could
proceed
with
considerable
confidence
to
the
second
message
which
worked
out
in
this
fashion
elri
es
here
could
only
make
sense
by
putting
and
for
the
missing
letters
and
supposing
that
the
name
was
that
of
some
house
or
inn
at
which
the
writer
was
staying
inspector
martin
and
had
listened
with
the
utmost
interest
to
the
full
and
clear
account
of
how
my
friend
had
produced
results
which
had
led
to
so
complete
command
over
our
difficulties
what
did
you
do
then
sir
asked
the
inspector
had
every
reason
to
suppose
that
this
abe
slaney
was
an
american
since
abe
is
an
american
contraction
and
since
letter
from
america
had
been
the
starting
point
of
all
the
trouble
had
also
every
cause
to
think
that
there
was
some
criminal
secret
in
the
matter
the
lady
allusions
to
her
past
and
her
refusal
to
take
her
husband
into
her
confidence
both
pointed
in
that
direction
therefore
cabled
to
my
friend
wilson
hargreave
of
the
new
york
police
bureau
who
has
more
than
once
made
use
of
my
knowledge
of
london
crime
asked
him
whether
the
name
of
abe
slaney
was
known
to
him
here
is
his
reply
the
most
dangerous
crook
in
chicago
on
the
very
evening
upon
which
had
his
answer
hilton
cubitt
sent
me
the
last
message
from
slaney
working
with
known
letters
it
took
this
form
elsie
re
are
to
meet
thy
go
the
addition
of
and
completed
message
which
showed
me
that
the
rascal
was
proceeding
from
persuasion
to
threats
and
my
knowledge
of
the
crooks
of
chicago
prepared
me
to
find
that
he
might
very
rapidly
put
his
words
into
action
at
once
came
to
norfolk
with
my
friend
and
colleague
dr
watson
but
unhappily
only
in
time
to
find
that
the
worst
had
already
occurred
it
is
privilege
to
be
associated
with
you
in
the
handling
of
case
said
the
inspector
warmly
you
will
excuse
me
however
if
speak
frankly
to
you
are
only
answerable
to
yourself
but
have
to
answer
to
my
superiors
if
this
abe
slaney
living
at
elrige
is
indeed
the
murderer
and
if
he
has
made
his
escape
while
am
seated
here
should
certainly
get
into
serious
trouble
страница

you
need
not
be
uneasy
he
will
not
try
to
escape
how
do
you
know
to
fly
would
be
confession
of
guilt
then
let
us
go
to
arrest
him
expect
him
here
every
instant
but
why
should
he
come
because
have
written
and
asked
him
but
this
is
incredible
mr
holmes
why
should
he
come
because
you
have
asked
him
would
not
such
request
rather
rouse
his
suspicions
and
cause
him
to
fly
think
have
known
how
to
frame
the
letter
said
sherlock
holmes
in
fact
if
am
not
very
much
mistaken
here
is
the
gentleman
himself
coming
up
the
drive
man
was
striding
up
the
path
which
led
to
the
door
he
was
tall
handsome
swarthy
fellow
clad
in
suit
of
grey
flannel
with
panama
hat
bristling
black
beard
and
great
aggressive
hooked
nose
and
flourishing
cane
as
he
walked
he
swaggered
up
the
path
as
if
the
place
belonged
to
him
and
we
heard
his
loud
confident
peal
at
the
bell
think
gentlemen
said
holmes
quietly
that
we
had
best
take
up
our
position
behind
the
door
every
precaution
is
necessary
when
dealing
with
such
fellow
you
will
need
your
handcuffs
inspector
you
can
leave
the
talking
to
me
we
waited
in
silence
for
minute
one
of
those
minutes
which
one
can
never
forget
then
the
door
opened
and
the
man
stepped
in
an
instant
holmes
clapped
pistol
to
his
head
and
martin
slipped
the
handcuffs
over
his
wrists
it
was
all
done
so
swiftly
and
deftly
that
the
fellow
was
helpless
before
he
knew
that
he
was
attacked
he
glared
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
with
pair
of
blazing
black
eyes
then
he
burst
into
bitter
laugh
well
gentlemen
you
have
the
drop
on
me
this
time
seem
to
have
knocked
up
against
something
hard
but
came
here
in
answer
to
letter
from
mrs
hilton
cubitt
don
tell
me
that
she
is
in
this
don
tell
me
that
she
helped
to
set
trap
for
me
mrs
hilton
cubitt
was
seriously
injured
and
is
at
death
door
the
man
gave
hoarse
cry
of
grief
which
rang
through
the
house
you
re
crazy
he
cried
fiercely
it
was
he
that
was
hurt
not
she
who
would
have
hurt
little
elsie
may
have
threatened
her
god
forgive
me
but
would
not
have
touched
hair
of
her
pretty
head
take
it
back
you
say
that
she
is
not
hurt
she
was
found
badly
wounded
by
the
side
of
her
dead
husband
he
sank
with
deep
groan
on
to
the
settee
and
buried
his
face
in
his
manacled
hands
for
five
minutes
he
was
silent
then
he
raised
his
face
once
more
and
spoke
with
the
cold
composure
of
despair
have
nothing
to
hide
from
you
gentlemen
said
he
if
shot
the
man
he
had
his
shot
at
me
and
there
no
murder
in
that
but
if
you
think
could
have
hurt
that
woman
then
you
don
know
either
me
or
her
tell
you
there
was
never
man
in
this
world
loved
woman
more
than
loved
her
had
right
to
her
she
was
pledged
to
me
years
ago
who
was
this
englishman
that
he
should
come
between
us
tell
you
that
had
the
first
right
to
her
and
that
was
only
claiming
my
own
she
broke
away
from
your
influence
when
she
found
the
man
that
you
are
said
holmes
sternly
she
fled
from
america
to
avoid
you
and
she
married
an
honourable
gentleman
in
england
you
dogged
her
and
followed
her
and
made
her
life
misery
to
her
in
order
to
induce
her
to
abandon
the
husband
whom
she
loved
and
respected
in
order
to
fly
with
you
whom
she
feared
and
hated
you
have
ended
by
bringing
about
the
death
of
noble
man
and
driving
his
wife
to
suicide
that
is
your
record
in
this
business
mr
abe
slaney
and
you
will
answer
for
it
to
the
law
if
elsie
dies
care
nothing
what
becomes
of
me
said
the
american
he
opened
one
of
his
hands
and
looked
at
note
crumpled
up
in
his
palm
see
here
mister
he
cried
with
gleam
of
suspicion
in
his
eyes
you
re
not
trying
to
scare
me
over
this
are
you
if
the
lady
is
hurt
as
bad
as
you
say
who
was
it
that
wrote
this
note
he
tossed
it
forwards
on
to
the
table
wrote
it
to
bring
you
here
you
wrote
it
there
was
no
one
on
earth
outside
the
joint
who
knew
the
secret
of
the
dancing
men
how
came
you
to
write
it
what
one
man
can
invent
another
can
discover
said
holmes
there
is
cab
coming
to
convey
you
to
norwich
mr
slaney
but
meanwhile
you
have
time
to
make
some
small
reparation
for
the
injury
you
have
wrought
are
you
aware
that
mrs
hilton
cubitt
has
herself
lain
under
grave
suspicion
of
the
murder
of
her
husband
and
that
it
was
only
my
presence
here
and
the
knowledge
which
happened
to
possess
which
has
saved
her
from
the
accusation
the
least
that
you
owe
her
is
to
make
it
clear
to
the
whole
world
that
she
was
in
no
way
directly
or
indirectly
responsible
for
his
tragic
end
ask
nothing
better
said
the
american
guess
the
very
best
case
can
make
for
myself
is
the
absolute
naked
truth
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
you
that
it
will
be
used
against
you
cried
the
inspector
with
the
magnificent
fair
play
of
the
british
criminal
law
slaney
shrugged
his
shoulders
ll
chance
that
said
he
first
of
all
want
you
gentlemen
to
understand
that
have
known
this
lady
since
she
was
child
there
were
seven
of
us
in
gang
in
chicago
and
elsie
father
was
the
boss
of
the
joint
he
was
clever
man
was
old
patrick
it
was
he
who
invented
that
writing
which
would
pass
as
child
scrawl
unless
you
just
happened
to
have
the
key
to
it
well
elsie
learned
some
of
our
ways
but
she
couldn
stand
the
business
and
she
had
bit
of
honest
money
of
her
own
so
she
gave
us
all
the
slip
and
got
away
to
london
she
had
been
engaged
to
me
and
she
would
have
married
me
believe
if
had
taken
over
another
profession
but
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
anything
on
the
cross
it
was
only
after
her
marriage
to
this
englishman
that
was
able
to
find
out
where
she
was
wrote
to
her
but
got
no
answer
after
that
came
over
and
as
letters
were
no
use
put
my
messages
where
she
could
read
them
well
have
been
here
month
now
lived
in
that
farm
where
had
room
down
below
and
could
get
in
and
out
every
night
and
no
one
the
wiser
tried
all
could
to
coax
elsie
away
knew
that
she
read
the
messages
for
once
she
wrote
an
answer
under
one
of
them
then
my
temper
got
the
better
of
me
and
began
to
threaten
her
she
sent
me
letter
then
imploring
me
to
go
away
and
saying
that
it
would
break
her
heart
if
any
scandal
should
come
upon
her
husband
she
said
that
she
would
come
down
when
her
husband
was
asleep
at
three
in
the
morning
and
speak
with
me
through
the
end
window
if
would
go
away
afterwards
and
leave
her
in
peace
she
came
down
and
brought
money
with
her
trying
to
bribe
me
to
go
this
made
me
mad
and
caught
her
arm
and
tried
to
pull
her
through
the
window
at
that
moment
in
rushed
the
husband
with
his
revolver
in
his
hand
elsie
had
sunk
down
upon
the
floor
and
we
were
face
to
face
was
heeled
also
and
held
up
my
gun
to
scare
him
off
and
let
me
get
away
he
fired
and
missed
me
pulled
off
almost
at
the
same
instant
and
down
he
dropped
made
away
across
the
garden
and
as
went
heard
the
window
shut
behind
me
that
god
truth
gentlemen
every
word
of
it
and
heard
no
more
about
it
until
that
lad
came
riding
up
with
note
which
made
me
walk
in
here
like
jay
and
give
myself
into
your
hands
cab
had
driven
up
whilst
the
american
had
been
talking
two
uniformed
policemen
sat
inside
inspector
martin
rose
and
touched
his
prisoner
on
the
shoulder
it
is
time
for
us
to
go
can
see
her
first
no
she
is
not
conscious
mr
sherlock
holmes
only
hope
that
if
ever
again
have
an
important
case
shall
have
the
good
fortune
to
have
you
by
my
side
we
stood
at
the
window
and
watched
the
cab
drive
away
as
turned
back
my
eye
caught
the
pellet
of
paper
which
the
prisoner
had
tossed
upon
the
table
it
was
the
note
with
which
holmes
had
decoyed
him
see
if
you
can
read
it
watson
said
he
with
smile
it
contained
no
word
but
this
little
line
of
dancing
men
if
you
use
the
code
which
have
explained
said
holmes
you
will
find
that
it
simply
means
come
here
at
once
was
convinced
that
it
was
an
invitation
which
he
would
not
refuse
since
he
could
never
imagine
that
it
could
come
from
anyone
but
the
lady
and
so
my
dear
watson
we
have
ended
by
turning
the
dancing
men
to
good
when
they
have
so
often
been
the
agents
of
evil
and
think
that
have
fulfilled
my
promise
of
giving
you
something
unusual
for
your
note
book
three
forty
is
our
train
and
fancy
we
should
be
back
in
baker
street
for
dinner
only
one
word
of
epilogue
the
american
abe
slaney
was
condemned
to
death
at
the
winter
assizes
at
norwich
but
his
penalty
was
changed
to
penal
servitude
in
consideration
of
mitigating
circumstances
and
the
certainty
that
hilton
cubitt
had
fired
the
first
shot
of
mrs
hilton
cubitt
only
know
that
have
heard
she
recovered
entirely
and
that
she
still
remains

iv
the
adventure
of
the
solitary
cyclist
from
the
years
1894
to
1901
inclusive
mr
sherlock
holmes
was
very
busy
man
it
is
safe
to
say
that
there
was
no
public
case
of
any
difficulty
in
which
he
was
not
consulted
during
those
eight
years
and
there
were
hundreds
of
private
cases
some
of
them
of
the
most
intricate
and
extraordinary
character
in
which
he
played
prominent
part
many
startling
successes
and
few
unavoidable
failures
were
the
outcome
of
this
long
period
of
continuous
work
as
have
preserved
very
full
notes
of
all
these
cases
and
was
myself
personally
engaged
in
many
of
them
it
may
be
imagined
that
it
is
no
easy
task
to
know
which
should
select
to
lay
before
the
public
shall
however
preserve
my
former
rule
and
give
the
preference
to
those
cases
which
derive
their
interest
not
so
much
from
the
brutality
of
the
crime
as
from
the
ingenuity
and
dramatic
quality
of
the
solution
for
this
reason
will
now
lay
before
the
reader
the
facts
connected
with
miss
violet
smith
the
solitary
cyclist
of
charlington
and
the
curious
sequel
of
our
investigation
which
culminated
in
unexpected
tragedy
it
is
true
that
the
circumstances
did
not
admit
of
any
striking
illustration
of
those
powers
for
which
my
friend
was
famous
but
there
were
some
points
about
the
case
which
made
it
stand
out
in
those
long
records
of
crime
from
which
gather
the
material
for
these
little
narratives
on
referring
to
my
note
book
for
the
year
1895
find
that
it
was
upon
saturday
the
23rd
of
april
that
we
first
heard
of
miss
violet
smith
her
visit
was
remember
extremely
unwelcome
to
holmes
for
he
was
immersed
at
the
moment
in
very
abstruse
and
complicated
problem
concerning
the
peculiar
persecution
to
which
john
vincent
harden
the
well
known
tobacco
millionaire
had
been
subjected
my
friend
who
loved
above
all
things
precision
and
concentration
of
thought
resented
anything
which
distracted
his
attention
from
the
matter
in
hand
and
yet
without
harshness
which
was
foreign
to
his
nature
it
was
impossible
to
refuse
to
listen
to
the
story
of
the
young
and
beautiful
woman
tall
graceful
and
queenly
who
presented
herself
at
baker
street
late
in
the
evening
and
implored
his
assistance
and
advice
it
was
vain
to
urge
that
his
time
was
already
fully
occupied
for
the
young
lady
had
come
with
the
determination
to
tell
her
story
and
it
was
evident
that
nothing
short
of
force
could
get
her
out
of
the
room
until
she
had
done
so
with
resigned
air
and
somewhat
weary
smile
holmes
begged
the
beautiful
intruder
to
take
seat
and
to
inform
us
what
it
was
that
was
troubling
her
at
least
it
cannot
be
your
health
said
he
as
his
keen
eyes
darted
over
her
so
ardent
bicyclist
must
be
full
of
energy
she
glanced
down
in
surprise
at
her
own
feet
and
observed
the
slight
roughening
of
the
side
of
the
sole
caused
by
the
friction
of
the
edge
of
the
pedal
yes
bicycle
good
deal
mr
holmes
and
that
has
something
to
do
with
my
visit
to
you
to
day
my
friend
took
the
lady
ungloved
hand
and
examined
it
with
as
close
an
attention
and
as
little
sentiment
as
scientist
would
show
to
specimen
you
will
excuse
me
am
sure
it
is
my
business
said
he
as
he
dropped
it
nearly
fell
into
the
error
of
supposing
that
you
were
typewriting
of
course
it
is
obvious
that
it
is
music
you
observe
the
spatulate
finger
end
watson
which
is
common
to
both
professions
there
is
spirituality
about
the
face
however
he
gently
turned
it
towards
the
light
which
the
typewriter
does
not
generate
this
lady
is
musician
yes
mr
holmes
teach
music
in
the
country
presume
from
your
complexion
yes
sir
near
farnham
on
the
borders
of
surrey
beautiful
neighbourhood
and
full
of
the
most
interesting
associations
you
remember
watson
that
it
was
near
there
that
we
took
archie
stamford
the
forger
now
miss
violet
what
has
happened
to
you
near
farnham
on
the
borders
of
surrey
the
young
lady
with
great
clearness
and
composure
made
the
following
curious
statement
my
father
is
dead
mr
holmes
he
was
james
smith
who
conducted
the
orchestra
at
the
old
imperial
theatre
my
mother
and
were
left
without
relation
in
the
world
except
one
uncle
ralph
smith
who
went
to
africa
twenty
five
years
ago
and
we
have
never
had
word
from
him
since
when
father
died
we
were
left
very
poor
but
one
day
we
were
told
that
there
was
an
advertisement
in
the
times
inquiring
for
our
whereabouts
you
can
imagine
how
excited
we
were
for
we
thought
that
someone
had
left
us
fortune
we
went
at
once
to
the
lawyer
whose
name
was
given
in
the
paper
there
we
met
two
gentlemen
mr
carruthers
and
mr
woodley
who
were
home
on
visit
from
south
africa
they
said
that
my
uncle
was
friend
of
theirs
that
he
died
some
months
before
in
great
poverty
in
johannesburg
and
that
he
had
asked
them
with
his
last
breath
to
hunt
up
his
relations
and
see
that
they
were
in
no
want
it
seemed
strange
to
us
that
uncle
ralph
who
took
no
notice
of
us
when
he
was
alive
should
be
so
careful
to
look
after
us
when
he
was
dead
but
mr
carruthers
explained
that
the
reason
was
that
my
uncle
had
just
heard
of
the
death
of
his
brother
and
so
felt
responsible
for
our
fate
excuse
me
said
holmes
when
was
this
interview
last
december
four
months
ago
pray
proceed
mr
woodley
seemed
to
me
to
be
most
odious
person
he
was
for
ever
making
eyes
at
me
coarse
puffy
faced
red
moustached
young
man
with
his
hair
plastered
down
on
each
side
of
his
forehead
thought
that
he
was
perfectly
hateful
and
was
sure
that
cyril
would
not
wish
me
to
know
such
person
oh
cyril
is
his
name
said
holmes
smiling
the
young
lady
blushed
and
laughed
yes
mr
holmes
cyril
morton
an
electrical
engineer
and
we
hope
to
be
married
at
the
end
of
the
summer
dear
me
how
did
get
talking
about
him
what
wished
to
say
was
that
mr
woodley
was
perfectly
odious
but
that
mr
carruthers
who
was
much
older
man
was
more
agreeable
he
was
dark
sallow
clean
shaven
silent
person
but
he
had
polite
manners
and
pleasant
smile
he
inquired
how
we
were
left
and
on
finding
that
we
were
very
poor
he
suggested
that
should
come
and
teach
music
to
his
only
daughter
aged
ten
said
that
did
not
like
to
leave
my
mother
on
which
he
suggested
that
should
go
home
to
her
every
week
end
and
he
offered
me
hundred
year
which
was
certainly
splendid
pay
so
it
ended
by
my
accepting
and
went
down
to
chiltern
grange
about
six
miles
from
farnham
mr
carruthers
was
widower
but
he
had
engaged
lady
housekeeper
very
respectable
elderly
person
called
mrs
dixon
to
look
after
his
establishment
the
child
was
dear
and
everything
promised
well
mr
carruthers
was
very
kind
and
very
musical
and
we
had
most
pleasant
evenings
together
every
week
end
went
home
to
my
mother
in
town
the
first
flaw
in
my
happiness
was
the
arrival
of
the
red
moustached
mr
woodley
he
came
for
visit
of
week
and
oh
it
seemed
three
months
to
me
he
was
dreadful
person
bully
to
everyone
else
but
to
me
something
infinitely
worse
he
made
odious
love
to
me
boasted
of
his
wealth
said
that
if
married
him
would
have
the
finest
diamonds
in
london
and
finally
when
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
he
seized
me
in
his
arms
one
day
after
dinner
he
was
hideously
strong
and
he
swore
that
he
would
not
let
me
go
until
had
kissed
him
mr
carruthers
came
in
and
tore
him
off
from
me
on
which
he
turned
upon
his
own
host
knocking
him
down
and
cutting
his
face
open
that
was
the
end
of
his
visit
as
you
can
imagine
mr
carruthers
apologized
to
me
next
day
and
assured
me
that
should
never
be
exposed
to
such
an
insult
again
have
not
seen
mr
woodley
since
and
now
mr
holmes
come
at
last
to
the
special
thing
which
has
caused
me
to
ask
your
advice
to
day
you
must
know
that
every
saturday
forenoon
ride
on
my
bicycle
to
farnham
station
in
order
to
get
the
12
22
to
town
the
road
from
chiltern
grange
is
lonely
one
and
at
one
spot
it
is
particularly
so
for
it
lies
for
over
mile
between
charlington
heath
upon
one
side
and
the
woods
which
lie
round
charlington
hall
upon
the
other
you
could
not
find
more
lonely
tract
of
road
anywhere
and
it
is
quite
rare
to
meet
so
much
as
cart
or
peasant
until
you
reach
the
high
road
near
crooksbury
hill
two
weeks
ago
was
passing
this
place
when
chanced
to
look
back
over
my
shoulder
and
about
two
hundred
yards
behind
me
saw
man
also
on
bicycle
he
seemed
to
be
middle
aged
man
with
short
dark
beard
looked
back
before
reached
farnham
but
the
man
was
gone
so
thought
no
more
about
it
but
you
can
imagine
how
surprised
was
mr
holmes
when
on
my
return
on
the
monday
saw
the
same
man
on
the
same
stretch
of
road
my
astonishment
was
increased
when
the
incident
occurred
again
exactly
as
before
on
the
following
saturday
and
monday
he
always
kept
his
distance
and
did
not
molest
me
in
any
way
but
still
it
certainly
was
very
odd
mentioned
it
to
mr
carruthers
who
seemed
interested
in
what
said
and
told
me
that
he
had
ordered
horse
and
trap
so
that
in
future
should
not
pass
over
these
lonely
roads
without
some
companion

the
horse
and
trap
were
to
have
come
this
week
but
for
some
reason
they
were
not
delivered
and
again
had
to
cycle
to
the
station
that
was
this
morning
you
can
think
that
looked
out
when
came
to
charlington
heath
and
there
sure
enough
was
the
man
exactly
as
he
had
been
the
two
weeks
before
he
always
kept
so
far
from
me
that
could
not
clearly
see
his
face
but
it
was
certainly
someone
whom
did
not
know
he
was
dressed
in
dark
suit
with
cloth
cap
the
only
thing
about
his
face
that
could
clearly
see
was
his
dark
beard
to
day
was
not
alarmed
but
was
filled
with
curiosity
and
determined
to
find
out
who
he
was
and
what
he
wanted
slowed
down
my
machine
but
he
slowed
down
his
then
stopped
altogether
but
he
stopped
also
then
laid
trap
for
him
there
is
sharp
turning
of
the
road
and
pedalled
very
quickly
round
this
and
then
stopped
and
waited
expected
him
to
shoot
round
and
pass
me
before
he
could
stop
but
he
never
appeared
then
went
back
and
looked
round
the
corner
could
see
mile
of
road
but
he
was
not
on
it
to
make
it
the
more
extraordinary
there
was
no
side
road
at
this
point
down
which
he
could
have
gone
holmes
chuckled
and
rubbed
his
hands
this
case
certainly
presents
some
features
of
its
own
said
he
how
much
time
elapsed
between
your
turning
the
corner
and
your
discovery
that
the
road
was
clear
two
or
three
minutes
then
he
could
not
have
retreated
down
the
road
and
you
say
that
there
are
no
side
roads
none
then
he
certainly
took
footpath
on
one
side
or
the
other
it
could
not
have
been
on
the
side
of
the
heath
or
should
have
seen
him
so
by
the
process
of
exclusion
we
arrive
at
the
fact
that
he
made
his
way
towards
charlington
hall
which
as
understand
is
situated
in
its
own
grounds
on
one
side
of
the
road
anything
else
nothing
mr
holmes
save
that
was
so
perplexed
that
felt
should
not
be
happy
until
had
seen
you
and
had
your
advice
holmes
sat
in
silence
for
some
little
time
where
is
the
gentleman
to
whom
you
are
engaged
he
asked
at
last
he
is
in
the
midland
electrical
company
at
coventry
he
would
not
pay
you
surprise
visit
oh
mr
holmes
as
if
should
not
know
him
have
you
had
any
other
admirers
several
before
knew
cyril
and
since
there
was
this
dreadful
man
woodley
if
you
can
call
him
an
admirer
no
one
else
our
fair
client
seemed
little
confused
who
was
he
asked
holmes
oh
it
may
be
mere
fancy
of
mine
but
it
has
seemed
to
me
sometimes
that
my
employer
mr
carruthers
takes
great
deal
of
interest
in
me
we
are
thrown
rather
together
play
his
accompaniments
in
the
evening
he
has
never
said
anything
he
is
perfect
gentleman
but
girl
always
knows
ha
holmes
looked
grave
what
does
he
do
for
living
he
is
rich
man
no
carriages
or
horses
well
at
least
he
is
fairly
well
to
do
but
he
goes
into
the
city
two
or
three
times
week
he
is
deeply
interested
in
south
african
gold
shares
you
will
let
me
know
any
fresh
development
miss
smith
am
very
busy
just
now
but
will
find
time
to
make
some
inquiries
into
your
case
in
the
meantime
take
no
step
without
letting
me
know
good
bye
and
trust
that
we
shall
have
nothing
but
good
news
from
you
it
is
part
of
the
settled
order
of
nature
that
such
girl
should
have
followers
said
holmes
as
he
pulled
at
his
meditative
pipe
but
for
choice
not
on
bicycles
in
lonely
country
roads
some
secretive
lover
beyond
all
doubt
but
there
are
curious
and
suggestive
details
about
the
case
watson
that
he
should
appear
only
at
that
point
exactly
our
first
effort
must
be
to
find
who
are
the
tenants
of
charlington
hall
then
again
how
about
the
connection
between
carruthers
and
woodley
since
they
appear
to
be
men
of
such
different
type
how
came
they
both
to
be
so
keen
upon
looking
up
ralph
smith
relations
one
more
point
what
sort
of
menage
is
it
which
pays
double
the
market
price
for
governess
but
does
not
keep
horse
although
six
miles
from
the
station
odd
watson
very
odd
you
will
go
down
no
my
dear
fellow
you
will
go
down
this
may
be
some
trifling
intrigue
and
cannot
break
my
other
important
research
for
the
sake
of
it
on
monday
you
will
arrive
early
at
farnham
you
will
conceal
yourself
near
charlington
heath
you
will
observe
these
facts
for
yourself
and
act
as
your
own
judgment
advises
then
having
inquired
as
to
the
occupants
of
the
hall
you
will
come
back
to
me
and
report
and
now
watson
not
another
word
of
the
matter
until
we
have
few
solid
stepping
stones
on
which
we
may
hope
to
get
across
to
our
solution
we
had
ascertained
from
the
lady
that
she
went
down
upon
the
monday
by
the
train
which
leaves
waterloo
at
50
so
started
early
and
caught
the
13
at
farnham
station
had
no
difficulty
in
being
directed
to
charlington
heath
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
the
scene
of
the
young
lady
adventure
for
the
road
runs
between
the
open
heath
on
one
side
and
an
old
yew
hedge
upon
the
other
surrounding
park
which
is
studded
with
magnificent
trees
there
was
main
gateway
of
lichen
studded
stone
each
side
pillar
surmounted
by
mouldering
heraldic
emblems
but
besides
this
central
carriage
drive
observed
several
points
where
there
were
gaps
in
the
hedge
and
paths
leading
through
them
the
house
was
invisible
from
the
road
but
the
surroundings
all
spoke
of
gloom
and
decay
the
heath
was
covered
with
golden
patches
of
flowering
gorse
gleaming
magnificently
in
the
light
of
the
bright
spring
sunshine
behind
one
of
these
clumps
took
up
my
position
so
as
to
command
both
the
gateway
of
the
hall
and
long
stretch
of
the
road
upon
either
side
it
had
been
deserted
when
left
it
but
now
saw
cyclist
riding
down
it
from
the
opposite
direction
to
that
in
which
had
come
he
was
clad
in
dark
suit
and
saw
that
he
had
black
beard
on
reaching
the
end
of
the
charlington
grounds
he
sprang
from
his
machine
and
led
it
through
gap
in
the
hedge
disappearing
from
my
view
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
and
then
second
cyclist
appeared
this
time
it
was
the
young
lady
coming
from
the
station
saw
her
look
about
her
as
she
came
to
the
charlington
hedge
an
instant
later
the
man
emerged
from
his
hiding
place
sprang
upon
his
cycle
and
followed
her
in
all
the
broad
landscape
those
were
the
only
moving
figures
the
graceful
girl
sitting
very
straight
upon
her
machine
and
the
man
behind
her
bending
low
over
his
handle
bar
with
curiously
furtive
suggestion
in
every
movement
she
looked
back
at
him
and
slowed
her
pace
he
slowed
also
she
stopped
he
at
once
stopped
too
keeping
two
hundred
yards
behind
her
next
movement
was
as
unexpected
as
it
was
spirited
she
suddenly
whisked
her
wheels
round
and
dashed
straight
at
him
he
was
as
quick
as
she
however
and
darted
off
in
desperate
flight
presently
she
came
back
up
the
road
again
her
head
haughtily
in
the
air
not
deigning
to
take
any
further
notice
of
her
silent
attendant
he
had
turned
also
and
still
kept
his
distance
until
the
curve
of
the
road
hid
them
from
my
sight
remained
in
my
hiding
place
and
it
was
well
that
did
so
for
presently
the
man
reappeared
cycling
slowly
back
he
turned
in
at
the
hall
gates
and
dismounted
from
his
machine
for
some
few
minutes
could
see
him
standing
among
the
trees
his
hands
were
raised
and
he
seemed
to
be
settling
his
necktie
then
he
mounted
his
cycle
and
rode
away
from
me
down
the
drive
towards
the
hall
ran
across
the
heath
and
peered
through
the
trees
far
away
could
catch
glimpses
of
the
old
grey
building
with
its
bristling
tudor
chimneys
but
the
drive
ran
through
dense
shrubbery
and
saw
no
more
of
my
man
however
it
seemed
to
me
that
had
done
fairly
good
morning
work
and
walked
back
in
high
spirits
to
farnham
the
local
house
agent
could
tell
me
nothing
about
charlington
hall
and
referred
me
to
well
known
firm
in
pall
mall
there
halted
on
my
way
home
and
met
with
courtesy
from
the
representative
no
could
not
have
charlington
hall
for
the
summer
was
just
too
late
it
had
been
let
about
month
ago
mr
williamson
was
the
name
of
the
tenant
he
was
respectable
elderly
gentleman
the
polite
agent
was
afraid
he
could
say
no
more
as
the
affairs
of
his
clients
were
not
matters
which
he
could
discuss
mr
sherlock
holmes
listened
with
attention
to
the
long
report
which
was
able
to
present
to
him
that
evening
but
it
did
not
elicit
that
word
of
curt
praise
which
had
hoped
for
and
should
have
valued
on
the
contrary
his
austere
face
was
even
more
severe
than
usual
as
he
commented
upon
the
things
that
had
done
and
the
things
that
had
not
your
hiding
place
my
dear
watson
was
very
faulty
you
should
have
been
behind
the
hedge
then
you
would
have
had
close
view
of
this
interesting
person
as
it
is
you
were
some
hundreds
of
yards
away
and
can
tell
me
even
less
than
miss
smith
she
thinks
she
does
not
know
the
man
am
convinced
she
does
why
otherwise
should
he
be
so
desperately
anxious
that
she
should
not
get
so
near
him
as
to
see
his
features
you
describe
him
as
bending
over
the
handle
bar
concealment
again
you
see
you
really
have
done
remarkably
badly
he
returns
to
the
house
and
you
want
to
find
out
who
he
is
you
come
to
london
house

what
should
have
done
cried
with
some
heat
gone
to
the
nearest
public
house
that
is
the
centre
of
country
gossip
they
would
have
told
you
every
name
from
the
master
to
the
scullery
maid
williamson
it
conveys
nothing
to
my
mind
if
he
is
an
elderly
man
he
is
not
this
active
cyclist
who
sprints
away
from
that
athletic
young
lady
pursuit
what
have
we
gained
by
your
expedition
the
knowledge
that
the
girl
story
is
true
never
doubted
it
that
there
is
connection
between
the
cyclist
and
the
hall
never
doubted
that
either
that
the
hall
is
tenanted
by
williamson
who
the
better
for
that
well
my
dear
sir
don
look
so
depressed
we
can
do
little
more
until
next
saturday
and
in
the
meantime
may
make
one
or
two
inquiries
myself
next
morning
we
had
note
from
miss
smith
recounting
shortly
and
accurately
the
very
incidents
which
had
seen
but
the
pith
of
the
letter
lay
in
the
postscript
am
sure
that
you
will
respect
my
confidence
mr
holmes
when
tell
you
that
my
place
here
has
become
difficult
owing
to
the
fact
that
my
employer
has
proposed
marriage
to
me
am
convinced
that
his
feelings
are
most
deep
and
most
honourable
at
the
same
time
my
promise
is
of
course
given
he
took
my
refusal
very
seriously
but
also
very
gently
you
can
understand
however
that
the
situation
is
little
strained
our
young
friend
seems
to
be
getting
into
deep
waters
said
holmes
thoughtfully
as
he
finished
the
letter
the
case
certainly
presents
more
features
of
interest
and
more
possibility
of
development
than
had
originally
thought
should
be
none
the
worse
for
quiet
peaceful
day
in
the
country
and
am
inclined
to
run
down
this
afternoon
and
test
one
or
two
theories
which
have
formed
holmes
quiet
day
in
the
country
had
singular
termination
for
he
arrived
at
baker
street
late
in
the
evening
with
cut
lip
and
discoloured
lump
upon
his
forehead
besides
general
air
of
dissipation
which
would
have
made
his
own
person
the
fitting
object
of
scotland
yard
investigation
he
was
immensely
tickled
by
his
own
adventures
and
laughed
heartily
as
he
recounted
them
get
so
little
active
exercise
that
it
is
always
treat
said
he
you
are
aware
that
have
some
proficiency
in
the
good
old
british
sport
of
boxing
occasionally
it
is
of
service
to
day
for
example
should
have
come
to
very
ignominious
grief
without
it
begged
him
to
tell
me
what
had
occurred
found
that
country
pub
which
had
already
recommended
to
your
notice
and
there
made
my
discreet
inquiries
was
in
the
bar
and
garrulous
landlord
was
giving
me
all
that
wanted
williamson
is
white
bearded
man
and
he
lives
alone
with
small
staff
of
servants
at
the
hall
there
is
some
rumour
that
he
is
or
has
been
clergyman
but
one
or
two
incidents
of
his
short
residence
at
the
hall
struck
me
as
peculiarly
unecclesiastical
have
already
made
some
inquiries
at
clerical
agency
and
they
tell
me
that
there
was
man
of
that
name
in
orders
whose
career
has
been
singularly
dark
one
the
landlord
further
informed
me
that
there
are
usually
week
end
visitors
warm
lot
sir
at
the
hall
and
especially
one
gentleman
with
red
moustache
mr
woodley
by
name
who
was
always
there
we
had
got
as
far
as
this
when
who
should
walk
in
but
the
gentleman
himself
who
had
been
drinking
his
beer
in
the
tap
room
and
had
heard
the
whole
conversation
who
was
what
did
want
what
did
mean
by
asking
questions
he
had
fine
flow
of
language
and
his
adjectives
were
very
vigorous
he
ended
string
of
abuse
by
vicious
back
hander
which
failed
to
entirely
avoid
the
next
few
minutes
were
delicious
it
was
straight
left
against
slogging
ruffian
emerged
as
you
see
me
mr
woodley
went
home
in
cart
so
ended
my
country
trip
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
however
enjoyable
my
day
on
the
surrey
border
has
not
been
much
more
profitable
than
your
own
the
thursday
brought
us
another
letter
from
our
client
you
will
not
be
surprised
mr
holmes
said
she
to
hear
that
am
leaving
mr
carruthers
employment
even
the
high
pay
cannot
reconcile
me
to
the
discomforts
of
my
situation
on
saturday
come
up
to
town
and
do
not
intend
to
return
mr
carruthers
has
got
trap
and
so
the
dangers
of
the
lonely
road
if
there
ever
were
any
dangers
are
now
over
as
to
the
special
cause
of
my
leaving
it
is
not
merely
the
strained
situation
with
mr
carruthers
but
it
is
the
reappearance
of
that
odious
man
mr
woodley
he
was
always
hideous
but
he
looks
more
awful
than
ever
now
for
he
appears
to
have
had
an
accident
and
he
is
much
disfigured
saw
him
out
of
the
window
but
am
glad
to
say
did
not
meet
him
he
had
long
talk
with
mr
carruthers
who
seemed
much
excited
afterwards
woodley
must
be
staying
in
the
neighbourhood
for
he
did
not
sleep
here
and
yet
caught
glimpse
of
him
again
this
morning
slinking
about
in
the
shrubbery
would
sooner
have
savage
wild
animal
loose
about
the
place
loathe
and
fear
him
more
than
can
say
how
can
mr
carruthers
endure
such
creature
for
moment
however
all
my
troubles
will
be
over
on
saturday
so
trust
watson
so
trust
said
holmes
gravely
there
is
some
deep
intrigue
going
on
round
that
little
woman
and
it
is
our
duty
to
see
that
no
one
molests
her
upon
that
last
journey
think
watson
that
we
must
spare
time
to
run
down
together
on
saturday
morning
and
make
sure
that
this
curious
and
inconclusive
investigation
has
no
untoward
ending
confess
that
had
not
up
to
now
taken
very
serious
view
of
the
case
which
had
seemed
to
me
rather
grotesque
and
bizarre
than
dangerous
that
man
should
lie
in
wait
for
and
follow
very
handsome
woman
is
no
unheard
of
thing
and
if
he
had
so
little
audacity
that
he
not
only
dared
not
address
her
but
even
fled
from
her
approach
he
was
not
very
formidable
assailant
the
ruffian
woodley
was
very
different
person
but
except
on
one
occasion
he
had
not
molested
our
client
and
now
he
visited
the
house
of
carruthers
without
intruding
upon
her
presence
the
man
on
the
bicycle
was
doubtless
member
of
those
week
end
parties
at
the
hall
of
which
the
publican
had
spoken
but
who
he
was
or
what
he
wanted
was
as
obscure
as
ever
it
was
the
severity
of
holmes
manner
and
the
fact
that
he
slipped
revolver
into
his
pocket
before
leaving
our
rooms
which
impressed
me
with
the
feeling
that
tragedy
might
prove
to
lurk
behind
this
curious
train
of
events
rainy
night
had
been
followed
by
glorious
morning
and
the
heath
covered
country
side
with
the
glowing
clumps
of
flowering
gorse
seemed
all
the
more
beautiful
to
eyes
which
were
weary
of
the
duns
and
drabs
and
slate
greys
of
london
holmes
and
walked
along
the
broad
sandy
road
inhaling
the
fresh
morning
air
and
rejoicing
in
the
music
of
the
birds
and
the
fresh
breath
of
the
spring
from
rise
of
the
road
on
the
shoulder
of
crooksbury
hill
we
could
see
the
grim
hall
bristling
out
from
amidst
the
ancient
oaks
which
old
as
they
were
still
younger
than
the
building
which
they
surrounded
holmes
pointed
down
the
long
tract
of
road
which
wound
reddish
yellow
band
between
the
brown
of
the
heath
and
the
budding
green
of
the
woods
far
away
black
dot
we
could
see
vehicle
moving
in
our
direction
holmes
gave
an
exclamation
of
impatience
had
given
margin
of
half
an
hour
said
he
if
that
is
her
trap
she
must
be
making
for
the
earlier
train
fear
watson
that
she
will
be
past
charlington
before
we
can
possibly
meet
her
from
the
instant
that
we
passed
the
rise
we
could
no
longer
see
the
vehicle
but
we
hastened
onwards
at
such
pace
that
my
sedentary
life
began
to
tell
upon
me
and
was
compelled
to
fall
behind
holmes
however
was
always
in
training
for
he
had
inexhaustible
stores
of
nervous
energy
upon
which
to
draw
his
springy
step
never
slowed
until
suddenly
when
he
was
hundred
yards
in
front
of
me
he
halted
and
saw
him
throw
up
his
hand
with
gesture
of
grief
and
despair
at
the
same
instant
an
empty
dog
cart
the
horse
cantering
the
reins
trailing
appeared
round
the
curve
of
the
road
and
rattled
swiftly
towards
us
too
late
watson
too
late
cried
holmes
as
ran
panting
to
his
side
fool
that
was
not
to
allow
for
that
earlier
train
it

knows
what

the
road
stop
the
horse
that
right
now
jump
in
and
let
us
see
if
can
repair
the
consequences
of
my
own
blunder
we
had
sprung
into
the
dog
cart
and
holmes
after
turning
the
horse
gave
it
sharp
cut
with
the
whip
and
we
flew
back
along
the
road
as
we
turned
the
curve
the
whole
stretch
of
road
between
the
hall
and
the
heath
was
opened
up
grasped
holmes
arm
that
the
man
gasped
solitary
cyclist
was
coming
towards
us
his
head
was
down
and
his
shoulders
rounded
as
he
put
every
ounce
of
energy
that
he
possessed
on
to
the
pedals
he
was
flying
like
racer
suddenly
he
raised
his
bearded
face
saw
us
close
to
him
and
pulled
up
springing
from
his
machine
that
coal
black
beard
was
in
singular
contrast
to
the
pallor
of
his
face
and
his
eyes
were
as
bright
as
if
he
had
fever
he
stared
at
us
and
at
the
dog
cart
then
look
of
amazement
came
over
his
face

that

met
the

drove
back
to
help
the
young
lady

he
ran
distractedly
his
pistol
in
his
hand
towards
gap
in
the
hedge
holmes
followed
him
and
leaving
the
horse
grazing
beside
the
road

this
in

about

like

he
lay
upon
his

his

drawn
up
terrible
cut
upon

head
he
was
insensible

at

we
ran
frantically
down
the
path
which
wound
among
the
trees

had
reached
the
shrubbery
which
surrounded

pulled
up

shrill
scream
which
vibrated
with
frenzy
of
horror
burst
from
the
thick
green
clump
of
bushes
in

of

ended
suddenly
on
its
highest
note
with
choke
and
gurgle
this

this
way
they
are
in
the
bowling
alley
cried
the
stranger
darting
through
the
bushes
ah
the
cowardly
dogs
follow
me
gentlemen
too
late
too
late
by
the
living
jingo
we
had
broken
suddenly
into
lovely
glade
of
greensward
surrounded
by
ancient
trees
on
the
farther
side
of
it
under
the
shadow
of
mighty
oak
there
stood
singular
group
of
three
people
one
was
woman
our
client
drooping
and
faint
handkerchief
round
her
mouth
opposite
her
stood
brutal
heavy
faced
red
moustached
young
man
his
gaitered
legs
parted
wide
one
arm
akimbo
the
other
waving
riding
crop
his
whole
attitude
suggestive
of
triumphant
bravado
between
them
an
elderly
grey
bearded
man
wearing
short
surplice
over
light
tweed
suit
had
evidently
just
completed
the
wedding
service
for
he
pocketed
his
prayer
book
as
we
appeared
and
slapped
the
sinister
bridegroom
upon
the
back
in
jovial
congratulation
they
re
married
gasped
come
on
cried
our
guide
come
on
he
rushed
across
the
glade
holmes
and
at
his
heels
as
we
approached
the
lady
staggered
against
the
trunk
of
the
tree
for
support
williamson
the
ex
clergyman
bowed
to
us
with
mock
politeness
and
the
bully
woodley
advanced
with
shout
of
brutal
and
exultant
laughter
you
can
take
your
beard
off
bob
said
he
know
you
right
enough
well
you
and
your
pals
have
just
come
in
time
for
me
to
be
able
to
introduce
you
to
mrs
woodley
our
guide
answer
was
singular
one
he
snatched
off
the
dark
beard
which
had
disguised
him
and
threw
it
on
the
ground
disclosing
long
sallow
clean
shaven
face
below
it
then
he
raised
his
revolver
and
covered
the
young
ruffian
who
was
advancing
upon
him
with
his
dangerous
riding
crop
swinging
in
his
hand
yes
said
our
ally
am
bob
carruthers
and
ll
see
this
woman
righted
if
have
to
swing
for
it
told
you
what
do
if
you
molested
her
and
by
the
lord
ll
be
as
good
as
my
word
you
re
too
late
she
my
wife
no
she
your
widow
his
revolver
cracked
and
saw
the
blood
spurt
from
the
front
of
woodley
waistcoat
he
spun
round
with
scream
and
fell
upon
his
back
his
hideous
red
face
turning
suddenly
to
dreadful
mottled
pallor
the
old
man
still
clad
in
his
surplice
burst
into
such
string
of
foul
oaths
as
have
never
heard
and
pulled
out
revolver
of
his
own
but
before
he
could
raise
it
he
was
looking
down
the
barrel
of
holmes
weapon
enough
of
this
said
my
friend
coldly
drop
that
pistol
watson
pick
it
up
hold
it
to
his
head
thank
you
carruthers
give
me
that
revolver
we
ll
have
no
more
violence
come
hand
it
over
who
are
you
then
my
name
is
sherlock
holmes
good
lord
you
have
heard
of
me
see
will
represent
the
official
police
until
their
arrival
here
you
he
shouted
to
frightened
groom
who
had
appeared
at
the
edge
of
the
glade
come
here
take
this
note
as
hard
as
you
can
ride
to
farnham
he
scribbled
few
words
upon
leaf
from
his
note
book
give
it
to
the
superintendent
at
the
police
station
until
he
comes
must
detain
you
all
under
my
personal
custody
the
strong
masterful
personality
of
holmes
dominated
the
tragic
scene
and
all
were
equally
puppets
in
his
hands
williamson
and
carruthers
found
themselves
carrying
the
wounded
woodley
into
the
house
and
gave
my
arm
to
the
frightened
girl
the
injured
man
was
laid
on
his
bed
and
at
holmes
request
examined
him
carried
my
report
to
where
he
sat
in
the
old
tapestry
hung
dining
room
with
his
two
prisoners
before
him
he
will
live
said
what
cried
carruthers
springing
out
of
his
chair
ll
go
upstairs
and
finish
him
first
do
you
tell
me
that
girl
that
angel
is
to
be
tied
to
roaring
jack
woodley
for
life
you
need
not
concern
yourself
about
that
said
holmes
there
are
two
very
good
reasons
why
she
should
under
no
circumstances
be
his
wife
in
the
first
place
we
are
very
safe
in
questioning
mr
williamson
right
to
solemnize
marriage
have
been
ordained
cried
the
old
rascal
and
also
unfrocked
once
clergyman
always
clergyman
think
not
how
about
the
license
we
had
license
for
the
marriage
have
it
here
in
my
pocket
then
you
got
it
by
trick
but
in
any
case
forced
marriage
is
no
marriage
but
it
is
very
serious
felony
as
you
will
discover
before
you
have
finished
you
ll
have
time
to
think
the
point
out
during
the
next
ten
years
or
so
unless
am
mistaken
as
to
you
carruthers
you
would
have
done
better
to
keep
your
pistol
in
your
pocket
begin
to
think
so
mr
holmes
but
when
thought
of
all
the
precaution
had
taken
to
shield
this
girl
for
loved
her
mr
holmes
and
it
is
the
only
time
that
ever
knew
what
love
was
it
fairly
drove
me
mad
to
think
that
she
was
in
the
power
of
the
greatest
brute
and
bully
in
south
africa
man
whose
name
is
holy
terror
from
kimberley
to
johannesburg
why
mr
holmes
you
ll
hardly
believe
it
but
ever
since
that
girl
has
been
in
my
employment
never
once
let
her
go
past
this
house
where
knew
these
rascals
were
lurking
without
following
her
on
my
bicycle
just
to
see
that
she
came
to
no
harm
kept
my
distance
from
her
and
wore
beard
so
that
she
should
not
recognise
me
for
she
is
good
and
high
spirited
girl
and
she
wouldn
have
stayed
in
my
employment
long
if
she
had
thought
that
was
following
her
about
the
country
roads
why
didn
you
tell
her
of
her
danger
because
then
again
she
would
have
left
me
and
couldn
bear
to
face
that
even
if
she
couldn
love
me
it
was
great
deal
to
me
just
to
see
her
dainty
form
about
the
house
and
to
hear
the
sound
of
her
voice
well
said
you
call
that
love
mr
carruthers
but
should
call
it
selfishness
maybe
the
two
things
go
together
anyhow
couldn
let
her
go
besides
with
this
crowd
about
it
was
well
that
she
should
have
someone
near
to
look
after
her
then
when
the
cable
came
knew
they
were
bound
to
make
move
what
cable
carruthers
took
telegram
from
his
pocket
that
it
said
he
it
was
short
and
concise
the
old
man
is
dead
hum
said
holmes
think
see
how
things
worked
and
can
understand
how
this
message
would
as
you
say
bring
them
to
head
but
while
we
wait
you
might
tell
me
what
you
can
the
old
reprobate
with
the
surplice
burst
into
volley
of
bad
language
by
heaven
said
he
if
you
squeal
on
us
bob
carruthers
ll
serve
you
as
you
served
jack
woodley
you
can
bleat
about
the
girl
to
your
heart
content
for
that
your
own
affair
but
if
you
round
on
your
pals
to
this
plain
clothes
copper
it
will
be
the
worst
day
work
that
ever
you
did

your
reverence
need
not
be
excited
said
holmes
lighting
cigarette
the
case
is
clear
enough
against
you
and
all
ask
is
few
details
for
my
private
curiosity
however
if
there
any
difficulty
in
your
telling
me
ll
do
the
talking
and
then
you
will
see
how
far
you
have
chance
of
holding
back
your
secrets
in
the
first
place
three
of
you
came
from
south
africa
on
this
game
you
williamson
you
carruthers
and
woodley
lie
number
one
said
the
old
man
never
saw
either
of
them
until
two
months
ago
and
have
never
been
in
africa
in
my
life
so
you
can
put
that
in
your
pipe
and
smoke
it
mr
busybody
holmes
what
he
says
is
true
said
carruthers
well
two
of
you
came
over
his
reverence
is
our
own
home
made
article
you
had
known
ralph
smith
in
south
africa
you
had
reason
to
believe
he
would
not
live
long
you
found
out
that
his
niece
would
inherit
his
fortune
how
that
eh
carruthers
nodded
and
williamson
swore
she
was
next
of
kin
no
doubt
and
you
were
aware
that
the
old
fellow
would
make
no
will
couldn
read
or
write
said
carruthers
so
you
came
over
the
two
of
you
and
hunted
up
the
girl
the
idea
was
that
one
of
you
was
to
marry
her
and
the
other
have
share
of
the
plunder
for
some
reason
woodley
was
chosen
as
the
husband
why
was
that
we
played
cards
for
her
on
the
voyage
he
won
see
you
got
the
young
lady
into
your
service
and
there
woodley
was
to
do
the
courting
she
recognised
the
drunken
brute
that
he
was
and
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
meanwhile
your
arrangement
was
rather
upset
by
the
fact
that
you
had
yourself
fallen
in
love
with
the
lady
you
could
no
longer
bear
the
idea
of
this
ruffian
owning
her
no
by
george
couldn
there
was
quarrel
between
you
he
left
you
in
rage
and
began
to
make
his
own
plans
independently
of
you
it
strikes
me
williamson
there
isn
very
much
that
we
can
tell
this
gentleman
cried
carruthers
with
bitter
laugh
yes
we
quarreled
and
he
knocked
me
down
am
level
with
him
on
that
anyhow
then
lost
sight
of
him
that
was
when
he
picked
up
with
this
cast
padre
here
found
that
they
had
set
up
house
keeping
together
at
this
place
on
the
line
that
she
had
to
pass
for
the
station
kept
my
eye
on
her
after
that
for
knew
there
was
some
devilry
in
the
wind
saw
them
from
time
to
time
for
was
anxious
to
know
what
they
were
after
two
days
ago
woodley
came
up
to
my
house
with
this
cable
which
showed
that
ralph
smith
was
dead
he
asked
me
if
would
stand
by
the
bargain
said
would
not
he
asked
me
if
would
marry
the
girl
myself
and
give
him
share
said
would
willingly
do
so
but
that
she
would
not
have
me
he
said
let
us
get
her
married
first
and
after
week
or
two
she
may
see
things
bit
different
said
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
violence
so
he
went
off
cursing
like
the
foul
mouthed
blackguard
that
he
was
and
swearing
that
he
would
have
her
yet
she
was
leaving
me
this
week
end
and
had
got
trap
to
take
her
to
the
station
but
was
so
uneasy
in
my
mind
that
followed
her
on
my
bicycle
she
had
got
start
however
and
before
could
catch
her
the
mischief
was
done
the
first
thing
knew
about
it
was
when
saw
you
two
gentlemen
driving
back
in
her
dog
cart
holmes
rose
and
tossed
the
end
of
his
cigarette
into
the
grate
have
been
very
obtuse
watson
said
he
when
in
your
report
you
said
that
you
had
seen
the
cyclist
as
you
thought
arrange
his
necktie
in
the
shrubbery
that
alone
should
have
told
me
all
however
we
may
congratulate
ourselves
upon
curious
and
in
some
respects
unique
case
perceive
three
of
the
county
constabulary
in
the
drive
and
am
glad
to
see
that
the
little
ostler
is
able
to
keep
pace
with
them
so
it
is
likely
that
neither
he
nor
the
interesting
bridegroom
will
be
permanently
damaged
by
their
morning
adventures
think
watson
that
in
your
medical
capacity
you
might
wait
upon
miss
smith
and
tell
her
that
if
she
is
sufficiently
recovered
we
shall
be
happy
to
escort
her
to
her
mother
home
if
she
is
not
quite
convalescent
you
will
find
that
hint
that
we
were
about
to
telegraph
to
young
electrician
in
the
midlands
would
probably
complete
the
cure
as
to
you
mr
carruthers
think
that
you
have
done
what
you
could
to
make
amends
for
your
share
in
an
evil
plot
there
is
my
card
sir
and
if
my
evidence
can
be
of
help
to
you
in
your
trial
it
shall
be
at
your
disposal
in
the
whirl
of
our
incessant
activity
it
has
often
been
difficult
for
me
as
the
reader
has
probably
observed
to
round
off
my
narratives
and
to
give
those
final
details
which
the
curious
might
expect
each
case
has
been
the
prelude
to
another
and
the
crisis
once
over
the
actors
have
passed
for
ever
out
of
our
busy
lives
find
however
short
note
at
the
end
of
my
manuscripts
dealing
with
this
case
in
which
have
put
it
upon
record
that
miss
violet
smith
did
indeed
inherit
large
fortune
and
that
she
is
now
the
wife
of
cyril
morton
the
senior
partner
of
morton
kennedy
the
famous
westminster
electricians
williamson
and
woodley
were
both
tried
for
abduction
and
assault
the
former
getting
seven
years
and
the
latter
ten
of
the
fate
of
carruthers
have
no
record
but
am
sure
that
his
assault
was
not
viewed
very
gravely
by
the
court
since
woodley
had
the
reputation
of
being
most
dangerous
ruffian
and
think
that
few
months
were
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
justice
the
adventure
of
the
priory
school
we
have
had
some
dramatic
entrances
and
exits
upon
our
small
stage
at
baker
street
but
cannot
recollect
anything
more
sudden
and
startling
than
the
first
appearance
of
thorneycroft
huxtable
ph
etc
his
card
which
seemed
too
small
to
carry
the
weight
of
his
academic
distinctions
preceded
him
by
few
seconds
and
then
he
entered
himself
so
large
so
pompous
and
so
dignified
that
he
was
the
very
embodiment
of
self
possession
and
solidity
and
yet
his
first
action
when
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
was
to
stagger
against
the
table
whence
he
slipped
down
upon
the
floor
and
there
was
that
majestic
figure
prostrate
and
insensible
upon
our
bearskin
hearthrug
we
had
sprung
to
our
feet
and
for
few
moments
we
stared
in
silent
amazement
at
this
ponderous
piece
of
wreckage
which
told
of
some
sudden
and
fatal
storm
far
out
on
the
ocean
of
life
then
holmes
hurried
with
cushion
for
his
head
and
with
brandy
for
his
lips
the
heavy
white
face
was
seamed
with
lines
of
trouble
the
hanging
pouches
under
the
closed
eyes
were
leaden
in
colour
the
loose
mouth
drooped
dolorously
at
the
corners
the
rolling
chins
were
unshaven
collar
and
shirt
bore
the
grime
of
long
journey
and
the
hair
bristled
unkempt
from
the
well
shaped
head
it
was
sorely
stricken
man
who
lay
before
us
what
is
it
watson
asked
holmes
absolute
exhaustion
possibly
mere
hunger
and
fatigue
said
with
my
finger
on
the
thready
pulse
where
the
stream
of
life
trickled
thin
and
small
return
ticket
from
mackleton
in
the
north
of
england
said
holmes
drawing
it
from
the
watch
pocket
it
is
not
twelve
clock
yet
he
has
certainly
been
an
early
starter
the
puckered
eyelids
had
begun
to
quiver
and
now
pair
of
vacant
grey
eyes
looked
up
at
us
an
instant
later
the
man
had
scrambled
on
to
his
feet
his
face
crimson
with
shame
forgive
this
weakness
mr
holmes
have
been
little
overwrought
thank
you
if
might
have
glass
of
milk
and
biscuit
have
no
doubt
that
should
be
better
came
personally
mr
holmes
in
order
to
ensure
that
you
would
return
with
me
feared
that
no
telegram
would
convince
you
of
the
absolute
urgency
of
the
case
when
you
are
quite
restored
am
quite
well
again
cannot
imagine
how
came
to
be
so
weak
wish
you
mr
holmes
to
come
to
mackleton
with
me
by
the
next
train
my
friend
shook
his
head
my
colleague
dr
watson
could
tell
you
that
we
are
very
busy
at
present
am
retained
in
this
case
of
the
ferrers
documents
and
the
abergavenny
murder
is
coming
up
for
trial
only
very
important
issue
could
call
me
from
london
at
present
important
our
visitor
threw
up
his
hands
have
you
heard
nothing
of
the
abduction
of
the
only
son
of
the
duke
of
holdernesse
what
the
late
cabinet
minister
exactly
we
had
tried
to
keep
it
out
of
the
papers
but
there
was
some
rumour
in
the
globe
last
night
thought
it
might
have
reached
your
ears
holmes
shot
out
his
long
thin
arm
and
picked

the
greatest
and
perhaps
the
wealthiest
am
aware
mr
holmes
that
you
take
very
high
line
in
professional
matters
and
that
you
are
prepared
to
work
for
the
work
sake
may
tell
you
however
that
his
grace
has
already
intimated
that
cheque
for
five
thousand
pounds
will
be
handed
over
to
the
person
who
can
tell
him
where
his
son
is
and
another
thousand
to
him
who
can
name
the
man
or
men
who
have
taken
him
it
is
princely
offer
said
holmes
watson
think
that
we
shall
accompany
dr
huxtable
back
to
the
north
of
england
and
now
dr
huxtable
when
you
have
consumed
that
milk
you
will
kindly
tell
me
what
has
happened
when
it
happened
how
it
happened
and
finally
what
dr
thorneycroft
huxtable
of
the
priory
school
near
mackleton
has
to
do
with
the
matter
and
why
he
comes
three
days
after
an
event
the
state
of
your
chin
gives
the
date
to
ask
for
my
humble
services
our
visitor
had
consumed
his
milk
and
biscuits
the
light
had
come
back
to
his
eyes
and
the
colour
to
his
cheeks
as
he
set
himself
with
great
vigour
and
lucidity
to
explain
the
situation
must
inform
you
gentlemen
that
the
priory
is
preparatory
school
of
which
am
the
founder
and
principal
huxtable
sidelights
on
horace
may
possibly
recall
my
name
to
your
memories
the
priory
is
without
exception
the
best
and
most
select
preparatory
school
in
england
lord
leverstoke
the
earl
of
blackwater
sir
cathcart
soames
they
all
have
entrusted
their
sons
to
me
but
felt
that
my
school
had
reached
its
zenith
when
three
weeks
ago
the
duke
of
holdernesse
sent
mr
james
wilder
his
secretary
with
the
intimation
that
young
lord
saltire
ten
years
old
his
only
son
and
heir
was
about
to
be
committed
to
my
charge
little
did
think
that
this
would
be
the
prelude
to
the
most
crushing
misfortune
of
my
life
on
may
1st
the
boy
arrived
that
being
the
beginning
of
the
summer
term
he
was
charming
youth
and
he
soon
fell
into
our
ways
may
tell
you
trust
that
am
not
indiscreet
but
half
confidences
are
absurd
in
such
case
that
he
was
not
entirely
happy
at
home
it
is
an
open
secret
that
the
duke
married
life
had
not
been
peaceful
one
and
the
matter
had
ended
in
separation
by
mutual
consent
the
duchess
taking
up
her
residence
in
the
south
of
france
this
had
occurred
very
shortly
before
and
the
boy
sympathies
are
known
to
have
been
strongly
with
his
mother
he
moped
after
her
departure
from
holdernesse
hall
and
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
duke
desired
to
send
him
to
my
establishment
in
fortnight
the
boy
was
quite
at
home
with
us
and
was
apparently
absolutely
happy
he
was
last
seen
on
the
night
of
may
13th
that
is
the
night
of
last
monday
his
room
was
on
the
second
floor
and
was
approached
through
another
larger
room
in
which
two
boys
were
sleeping
these
boys
saw
and
heard
nothing
so
that
it
is
certain
that
young
saltire
did
not
pass
out
that
way
his
window
was
open
and
there
is
stout
ivy
plant
leading
to
the
ground
we
could
trace
no
footmarks
below
but
it
is
sure
that
this
is
the
only
possible
exit
his
absence
was
discovered
at
seven
clock
on
tuesday
morning
his
bed
had
been
slept
in
he
had
dressed
himself
fully
before
going
off
in
his
usual
school
suit
of
black
eton
jacket
and
dark
grey
trousers
there
were
no
signs
that
anyone
had
entered
the
room
and
it
is
quite
certain
that
anything
in
the
nature
of
cries
or
struggle
would
have
been
heard
since
caunter
the
elder
boy
in
the
inner
room
is
very
light
sleeper
when
lord
saltire
disappearance
was
discovered
at
once
called
roll
of
the
whole
establishment
boys
masters
and
servants
it
was
then
that
we
ascertained
that
lord
saltire
had
not
been
alone
in
his
flight
heidegger
the
german
master
was
missing
his
room
was
on
the
second
floor
at
the
farther
end
of
the
building
facing
the
same
way
as
lord
saltire
his
bed
had
also
been
slept
in
but
he
had
apparently
gone
away
partly
dressed
since
his
shirt
and
socks
were
lying
on
the
floor
he
had
undoubtedly
let
himself
down
by
the
ivy
for
we
could
see
the
marks
of
his
feet
where
he
had
landed
on
the
lawn
his
bicycle
was
kept
in
small
shed
beside
this
lawn
and
it
also
was
gone
he
had
been
with
me
for
two
years
and
came
with
the
best
references
but
he
was
silent
morose
man
not
very
popular
either
with
masters
or
boys
no
trace
could
be
found
of
the
fugitives
and
now
on
thursday
morning
we
are
as
ignorant
as
we
were
on
tuesday
inquiry
was
of
course
made
at
once
at
holdernesse
hall
it
is
only
few
miles
away
and
we
imagined
that
in
some
sudden
attack
of
home
sickness
he
had
gone
back
to
his
father
but
nothing
had
been
heard
of
him
the
duke
is
greatly
agitated
and
as
to
me
you
have
seen
yourselves
the
state
of
nervous
prostration
to
which
the
suspense
and
the
responsibility
have
reduced
me
mr
holmes
if
ever
you
put
forward
your
full
powers
implore
you
to
do
so
now
for
never
in
your
life
could
you
have
case
which
is
more
worthy
of
them
sherlock
holmes
had
listened
with
the
utmost
intentness
to
the
statement
of
the
unhappy
schoolmaster
his
drawn
brows
and
the
deep
furrow
between
them
showed
that
he
needed
no
exhortation
to
concentrate
all
his
attention
upon
problem
which
apart
from
the
tremendous
interests
involved
must
appeal
so
directly
to
his
love
of
the
complex
and
the
unusual
he
now
drew
out
his
note
book
and
jotted
down
one
or
two
memoranda
you
have
been
very
remiss
in
not
coming
to
me
sooner
said
he
severely
you
start
me
on
my
investigation
with
very
serious
handicap
it
is
inconceivable
for
example
that
this
ivy
and
this
lawn
would
have
yielded
nothing
to
an
expert
observer
am
not
to
blame
mr
holmes
his
grace
was
extremely
desirous
to
avoid
all
public
scandal
he
was
afraid
of
his
family
unhappiness
being
dragged
before
the
world
he
has
deep
horror
of
anything
of
the
kind
but
there
has
been
some
official
investigation
yes
sir
and
it
has
proved
most
disappointing
an
apparent
clue
was
at
once
obtained
since
boy
and
young
man
were
reported
to
have
been
seen
leaving
neighbouring
station
by
an
early
train
only
last
night
we
had
news
that
the
couple
had
been
hunted
down
in
liverpool
and
they
prove
to
have
no
connection
whatever
with
the
matter
in
hand
then
it
was
that
in
my
despair
and
disappointment
after
sleepless
night
came
straight
to
you
by
the
early
train
suppose
the
local
investigation
was
relaxed
while
this
false
clue
was
being
followed
up
it
was
entirely
dropped
so
that
three
days
have
been
wasted
the
affair
has
been
most
deplorably
handled
feel
it
and
admit
it
and
yet
the
problem
should
be
capable
of
ultimate
solution
shall
be
very
happy
to
look
into
it
have
you
been
able
to
trace
any
connection
between
the
missing
boy
and
this
german
master
none
at
all
was
he
in
the
master
class
no
he
never
exchanged
word
with
him
so
far
as
know
that
is
certainly
very
singular
had
the
boy
bicycle
no
was
any
other
bicycle
missing
no
is
that
certain
quite
well
now
you
do
not
mean
to
seriously
suggest
that
this
german
rode
off
upon
bicycle
in
the
dead
of
the
night
bearing
the
boy
in
his
arms
certainly
not
then
what
is
the
theory
in
your
mind
the
bicycle
may
have
been
blind
it
may
have
been
hidden
somewhere
and
the
pair
gone
off
on
foot
quite
so
but
it
seems
rather
an
absurd
blind
does
it
not
were
there
other
bicycles
in
this
shed
several
would
he
not
have
hidden
couple
had
he
desired
to
give
the
idea
that
they
had
gone
off
upon
them
suppose
he
would
of
course
he
would
the
blind
theory
won
do
but
the
incident
is
an
admirable
starting
point
for
an
investigation
after
all
bicycle
is
not
an
easy
thing
to
conceal
or
to
destroy
one
other
question
did
anyone
call
to
see
the
boy
on
the
day
before
he
disappeared
no
did
he
get
any
letters
yes
one
letter
from
whom
from
his
father
do
you
open
the
boys
letters
no
how
do
you
know
it
was
from
the
father
the
coat
of
arms
was
on
the
envelope
and
it
was
addressed
in
the
duke
peculiar
stiff
hand
besides
the
duke
remembers
having
written
when
had
he
letter
before
that
not
for
several
days
had
he
ever
one
from
france
no
never
you
see
the
point
of
my
questions
of
course
either
the
boy
was
carried
off
by
force
or
he
went
of
his
own
free
will
in
the
latter
case
you
would
expect
that
some
prompting
from
outside
would
be
needed
to
make
so
young
lad
do
such
thing
if
he
has
had
no
visitors
that
prompting
must
have
come
in
letters
hence
try
to
find
out
who
were
his
correspondents
fear
cannot
help
you
much
his
only
correspondent
so
far
as
know
was
his
own
father

who
wrote
to
him
on
the
very
day
of
his
disappearance
were
the
relations
between
father
and
son
very
friendly
his
grace
is
never
very
friendly
with
anyone
he
is
completely
immersed
in
large
public
questions
and
is
rather
inaccessible
to
all
ordinary
emotions
but
he
was
always
kind
to
the
boy
in
his
own
way
but
the
sympathies
of
the
latter
were
with
the
mother
yes
did
he
say
so
no
the
duke
then
good
heavens
no
then
how
could
you
know
have
had
some
confidential
talks
with
mr
james
wilder
his
grace
secretary
it
was
he
who
gave
me
the
information
about
lord
saltire
feelings
see
by
the
way
that
last
letter
of
the
duke
was
it
found
in
the
boy
room
after
he
was
gone
no
he
had
taken
it
with
him
think
mr
holmes
it
is
time
that
we
were
leaving
for
euston
will
order
four
wheeler
in
quarter
of
an
hour
we
shall
be
at
your
service
if
you
are
telegraphing
home
mr
huxtable
it
would
be
well
to
allow
the
people
in
your
neighbourhood
to
imagine
that
the
inquiry
is
still
going
on
in
liverpool
or
wherever
else
that
red
herring
led
your
pack
in
the
meantime
will
do
little
quiet
work
at
your
own
doors
and
perhaps
the
scent
is
not
so
cold
but
that
two
old
hounds
like
watson
and
myself
may
get
sniff
of
it
that
evening
found
us
in
the
cold
bracing
atmosphere
of
the
peak
country
in
which
dr
huxtable
famous
school
is
situated
it
was
already
dark
when
we
reached
it
card
was
lying
on
the
hall
table
and
the
butler
whispered
something
to
his
master
who
turned
to
us
with
agitation
in
every
heavy
feature
the
duke
is
here
said
he
the
duke
and
mr
wilder
are
in
the
study
come
gentlemen
and
will
introduce
you
was
of
course
familiar
with
the
pictures
of
the
famous
statesman
but
the
man
himself
was
very
different
from
his
representation
he
was
tall
and
stately
person
scrupulously
dressed
with
drawn
thin
face
and
nose
which
was
grotesquely
curved
and
long
his
complexion
was
of
dead
pallor
which
was
more
startling
by
contrast
with
long
dwindling
beard
of
vivid
red
which
flowed
down
over
his
white
waistcoat
with
his
watch
chain
gleaming
through
its
fringe
such
was
the
stately
presence
who
looked
stonily
at
us
from
the
centre
of
dr
huxtable
hearthrug
beside
him
stood
very
young
man
whom
understood
to
be
wilder
the
private
secretary
he
was
small
nervous
alert
with
intelligent
light
blue
eyes
and
mobile
features
it
was
he
who
at
once
in
an
incisive
and
positive
tone
opened
the
conversation
called
this
morning
dr
huxtable
too
late
to
prevent
you
from
starting
for
london
learned
that
your
object
was
to
invite
mr
sherlock
holmes
to
undertake
the
conduct
of
this
case
his
grace
is
surprised
dr
huxtable
that
you
should
have
taken
such
step
without
consulting
him
when
learned
that
the
police
had
failed
his
grace
is
by
no
means
convinced
that
the
police
have
failed
but
surely
mr
wilder
you
are
well
aware
dr
huxtable
that
his
grace
is
particularly
anxious
to
avoid
all
public
scandal
he
prefers
to
take
as
few
people
as
possible
into
his
confidence
the
matter
can
be
easily
remedied
said
the
brow
beaten
doctor
mr
sherlock
holmes
can
return
to
london
by
the
morning
train
hardly
that
doctor
hardly
that
said
holmes
in
his
blandest
voice
this
northern
air
is
invigorating
and
pleasant
so
propose
to
spend
few
days
upon
your
moors
and
to
occupy
my
mind
as
best
may
whether
have
the
shelter
of
your
roof
or
of
the
village
inn
is
of
course
for
you
to
decide
could
see
that
the
unfortunate
doctor
was
in
the
last
stage
of
indecision
from
which
he
was
rescued
by
the
deep
sonorous
voice
of
the
red
bearded
duke
which
boomed
out
like
dinner
gong
agree
with
mr
wilder
dr
huxtable
that
you
would
have
done
wisely
to
consult
me
but
since
mr
holmes
has
already
been
taken
into
your
confidence
it
would
indeed
be
absurd
that
we
should
not
avail
ourselves
of
his
services
far
from
going
to
the
inn
mr
holmes
should
be
pleased
if
you
would
come
and
stay
with
me
at
holdernesse
hall
thank
your
grace
for
the
purposes
of
my
investigation
think
that
it
would
be
wiser
for
me
to
remain
at
the
scene
of
the
mystery
just
as
you
like
mr
holmes
any
information
which
mr
wilder
or
can
give
you
is
of
course
at
your
disposal
it
will
probably
be
necessary
for
me
to
see
you
at
the
hall
said
holmes
would
only
ask
you
now
sir
whether
you
have
formed
any
explanation
in
your
own
mind
as
to
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
your
son
no
sir
have
not
excuse
me
if
allude
to
that
which
is
painful
to
you
but
have
no
alternative
do
you
think
that
the
duchess
had
anything
to
do
with
the
matter
the
great
minister
showed
perceptible
hesitation
do
not
think
so
he
said
at
last
the
other
most
obvious
explanation
is
that
the
child
has
been
kidnapped
for
the
purpose
of
levying
ransom
you
have
not
had
any
demand
of
the
sort
no
sir
one
more
question
your
grace
understand
that
you
wrote
to
your
son
upon
the
day
when
this
incident
occurred
no
wrote
upon
the
day
before
exactly
but
he
received
it
on
that
day
yes
was
there
anything
in
your
letter
which
might
have
unbalanced
him
or
induced
him
to
take
such
step
no
sir
certainly
not
did
you
post
that
letter
yourself
the
nobleman
reply
was
interrupted
by
his
secretary
who
broke
in
with
some
heat
his
grace
is
not
in
the
habit
of
posting
letters
himself
said
he
this
letter
was
laid
with
others
upon
the
study
table
and
myself
put
them
in
the
post
bag
you
are
sure
this
one
was
among
them
yes
observed
it
how
many
letters
did
your
grace
write
that
day
twenty
or
thirty
have
large
correspondence
but
surely
this
is
somewhat
irrelevant
not
entirely
said
holmes
for
my
own
part
the
duke
continued
have
advised
the
police
to
turn
their
attention
to
the
south
of
france
have
already
said
that
do
not
believe
that
the
duchess
would
encourage
so
monstrous
an
action
but
the
lad
had
the
most
wrong
headed
opinions
and
it
is
possible
that
he
may
have
fled
to
her
aided
and
abetted
by
this
german
think
dr
huxtable
that
we
will
now
return
to
the
hall
could
see
that
there
were
other
questions
which
holmes
would
have
wished
to
put
but
the
nobleman
abrupt
manner
showed
that
the
interview
was
at
an
end
it
was
evident
that
to
his
intensely
aristocratic
nature
this
discussion
of
his
intimate
family
affairs
with
stranger
was
most
abhorrent
and
that
he
feared
lest
every
fresh
question
would
throw
fiercer
light
into
the
discreetly
shadowed
corners
of
his
ducal
history
when
the
nobleman
and
his
secretary
had
left
my
friend
flung
himself
at
once
with
characteristic
eagerness
into
the
investigation
the
boy
chamber
was
carefully
examined
and
yielded
nothing
save
the
absolute
conviction
that
it
was
only
through
the
window
that
he
could
have
escaped
the
german
master
room
and
effects
gave
no
further
clue
in
his
case
trailer
of
ivy
had
given
way
under
his
weight
and
we
saw
by
the
light
of
lantern
the
mark
on
the
lawn
where
his
heels
had
come
down
that
one
dint
in
the
short
green
grass
was
the
only
material
witness
left
of
this
inexplicable
nocturnal
flight
sherlock
holmes
left
the
house
alone
and
only
returned
after
eleven
he
had
obtained
large
ordnance
map
of
the
neighbourhood
and
this
he
brought
into
my
room
where
he
laid
it
out
on
the
bed
and
having
balanced
the
lamp
in
the
middle
of
it
he
began
to
smoke
over
it
and
occasionally
to
point
out
objects
of
interest
with
the
reeking
amber
of
his
pipe
this
case
grows
upon
me
watson
said
he
there
are
decidedly
some
points
of
interest
in
connection
with
it
in
this
early
stage
want
you
to
realize
those
geographical
features
which
may
have
good
deal
to
do
with
our
investigation
look
at
this
map
this
dark
square
is
the
priory
school
ll
put
pin
in
it
now
this
line
is
the
main
road
you
see
that
it
runs
east
and
west
past
the
school
and
you
see
also
that
there
is
no
side
road
for
mile
either
way
if
these
two
folk
passed
away
by
road
it
was
this
road
exactly
by
singular
and
happy
chance
we
are
able
to
some
extent
to
check
what
passed
along
this
road
during
the
night
in
question
at
this
point
where
my
pipe
is
now
resting
country
constable
was
on
duty
from
twelve
to
six
it
is
as
you
perceive
the
first
cross
road
on
the
east
side
this
man
declares
that
he
was
not
absent
from
his
post
for
an
instant
and
he
is
positive
that
neither
boy
nor
man
could
have
gone
that
way
unseen
have
spoken
with
this
policeman
to
night
and
he
appears
to
me
to
be
perfectly
reliable
person
that
blocks
this
end
we
have
now
to
deal
with
the
other
there
is
an
inn
here
the
red
bull
the
landlady
of
which
was
ill
she
had
sent
to
mackleton
for
doctor
but
he
did
not
arrive
until
morning
being
absent
at
another
case
the
people
at
the
inn
were
alert
all
night
awaiting
his
coming
and
one
or
other
of
them
seems
to
have
continually
had
an
eye
upon
the
road
they
declare
that
no
one
passed
if
their
evidence
is
good
then
we
are
fortunate
enough
to
be
able
to
block
the
west
and
also
to
be
able
to
say
that
the
fugitives
did
not
use
the
road
at
all
страница

but
the
bicycle
objected
quite
so
we
will
come
to
the
bicycle
presently
to
continue
our
reasoning
if
these
people
did
not
go
by
the
road
they
must
have
traversed
the
country
to
the
north
of
the
house
or
to
the
south
of
the
house
that
is
certain
let
us
weigh
the
one
against
the
other
on
the
south
of
the
house
is
as
you
perceive
large
district
of
arable
land
cut
up
into
small
fields
with
stone
walls
between
them
there
admit
that
bicycle
is
impossible
we
can
dismiss
the
idea
we
turn
to
the
country
on
the
north
here
there
lies
grove
of
trees
marked
as
the
ragged
shaw
and
on
the
farther
side
stretches
great
rolling
moor
lower
gill
moor
extending
for
ten
miles
and
sloping
gradually
upwards
here
at
one
side
of
this
wilderness
is
holdernesse
hall
ten
miles
by
road
but
only
six
across
the
moor
it
is
peculiarly
desolate
plain
few
moor
farmers
have
small
holdings
where
they
rear
sheep
and
cattle
except
these
the
plover
and
the
curlew
are
the
only
inhabitants
until
you
come
to
the
chesterfield
high
road
there
is
church
there
you
see
few
cottages
and
an
inn
beyond
that
the
hills
become
precipitous
surely
it
is
here
to
the
north
that
our
quest
must
lie
but
the
bicycle
persisted
well
said
holmes
impatiently
good
cyclist
does
not
need
high
road
the
moor
is
intersected
with
paths
and
the
moon
was
at
the
full
halloa
what
is
this
there
was
an
agitated
knock
at
the
door
and
an
instant
afterwards
dr
huxtable
was
in
the
room
in
his
hand
he
held
blue
cricket
cap
with
white
chevron
on
the
peak
at
last
we
have
clue
he
cried
thank
heaven
at
last
we
are
on
the
dear
boy
track
it
is
his
cap
where
was
it
found
in
the
van
of
the
gipsies
who
camped
on
the
moor
they
left
on
tuesday
to
day
the
police
traced
them
down
and
examined
their
caravan
this
was
found
how
do
they
account
for
it
they
shuffled
and
lied
said
that
they
found
it
on
the
moor
on
tuesday
morning
they
know
where
he
is
the
rascals
thank
goodness
they
are
all
safe
under
lock
and
key
either
the
fear
of
the
law
or
the
duke
purse
will
certainly
get
out
of
them
all
that
they
know
so
far
so
good
said
holmes
when
the
doctor
had
at
last
left
the
room
it
at
least
bears
out
the
theory
that
it
is
on
the
side
of
the
lower
gill
moor
that
we
must
hope
for
results
the
police
have
really
done
nothing
locally
save
the
arrest
of
these
gipsies
look
here
watson
there
is
watercourse
across
the
moor
you
see
it
marked
here
in
the
map
in
some
parts
it
widens
into
morass
this
is
particularly
so
in
the
region
between
holdernesse
hall
and
the
school
it
is
vain
to
look
elsewhere
for
tracks
in
this
dry
weather
but
at
that
point
there
is
certainly
chance
of
some
record
being
left
will
call
you
early
to
morrow
morning
and
you
and
will
try
if
we
can
throw
some
little
light
upon
the
mystery
the
day
was
just
breaking
when
woke
to
find
the
long
thin
form
of
holmes
by
my
bedside
he
was
fully
dressed
and
had
apparently
already
been
out
have
done
the
lawn
and
the
bicycle
shed
said
he
have
also
had
ramble
through
the
ragged
shaw
now
watson
there
is
cocoa
ready
in
the
next
room
must
beg
you
to
hurry
for
we
have
great
day
before
us
his
eyes
shone
and
his
cheek
was
flushed
with
the
exhilaration
of
the
master
workman
who
sees
his
work
lie
ready
before
him
very
different
holmes
this
active
alert
man
from
the
introspective
and
pallid
dreamer
of
baker
street
felt
as
looked
upon
that
supple
figure
alive
with
nervous
energy
that
it
was
indeed
strenuous
day
that
awaited
us
and
yet
it
opened
in
the
blackest
disappointment
with
high
hopes
we
struck
across
the
peaty
russet
moor
intersected
with
thousand
sheep
paths
until
we
came
to
the
broad
light
green
belt
which
marked
the
morass
between
us
and
holdernesse
certainly
if
the
lad
had
gone
homewards
he
must
have
passed
this
and
he
could
not
pass
it
without
leaving
his
traces
but
no
sign
of
him
or
the
german
could
be
seen
with
darkening
face
my
friend
strode
along
the
margin
eagerly
observant
of
every
muddy
stain
upon
the
mossy
surface
sheep
marks
there
were
in
profusion
and
at
one
place
some
miles
down
cows
had
left
their
tracks
nothing
more
check
number
one
said
holmes
looking
gloomily
over
the
rolling
expanse
of
the
moor
there
is
another
morass
down
yonder
and
narrow
neck
between
halloa
what
have
we
here
we
had
come
on
small
black
ribbon
of
pathway
in
the
middle
of
it
clearly
marked
on
the
sodden
soil
was
the
track
of
bicycle
hurrah
cried
we
have
it
but
holmes
was
shaking
his
head
and
his
face
was
puzzled
and
expectant
rather
than
joyous
bicycle
certainly
but
not
the
bicycle
said
he
am
familiar
with
forty
two
different
impressions
left
by
tyres
this
as
you
perceive
is
dunlop
with
patch
upon
the
outer
cover
heidegger
tyres
were
palmer
leaving
longitudinal
stripes
aveling
the
mathematical
master
was
sure
upon
the
point
therefore
it
is
not
heidegger
track
the
boy
then
possibly
if
we
could
prove
bicycle
to
have
been
in
his
possession
but
this
we
have
utterly
failed
to
do
this
track
as
you
perceive
was
made
by
rider
who
was
going
from
the
direction
of
the
school
or
towards
it
no
my
dear
watson
the
more
deeply
sunk
impression
is
of
course
the
hind
wheel
upon
which
the
weight
rests
you
perceive
several
places
where
it
has
passed
across
and
obliterated
the
more
shallow
mark
of
the
front
one
it
was
undoubtedly
heading
away
from
the
school
it
may
or
may
not
be
connected
with
our
inquiry
but
we
will
follow
it
backwards
before
we
go
any
farther
we
did
so
and
at
the
end
of
few
hundred
yards
lost
the
tracks
as
we
emerged
from
the
boggy
portion
of
the
moor
following
the
path
backwards
we
picked
out
another
spot
where
spring
trickled
across
it
here
once
again
was
the
mark
of
the
bicycle
though
nearly
obliterated
by
the
hoofs
of
cows
after
that
there
was
no
sign
but
the
path
ran
right
on
into
ragged
shaw
the
wood
which
backed
on
to
the
school
from
this
wood
the
cycle
must
have
emerged
holmes
sat
down
on
boulder
and
rested
his
chin
in
his
hands
had
smoked
two
cigarettes
before
he
moved
well
said
he
at
last
it
is
of
course
possible
that
cunning
man
might
change
the
tyre
of
his
bicycle
in
order
to
leave
unfamiliar
tracks
criminal
who
was
capable
of
such
thought
is
man
whom
should
be
proud
to
do
business
with
we
will
leave
this
question
undecided
and
hark
back
to
our
morass
again
for
we
have
left
good
deal
unexplored
we
continued
our
systematic
survey
of
the
edge
of
the
sodden
portion
of
the
moor
and
soon
our
perseverance
was
gloriously
rewarded
right
across
the
lower
part
of
the
bog
lay
miry
path
holmes
gave
cry
of
delight
as
he
approached
it
an
impression
like
fine
bundle
of
telegraph
wires
ran
down
the
centre
of
it
was
the
palmer
tyre
here
is
herr
heidegger
sure
enough
cried
holmes
exultantly
my
reasoning
seems
to
have
been
pretty
sound
watson
congratulate
you
but
we
have
long
way
still
to
go
kindly
walk
clear
of
the
path
now
let
us
follow
the
trail
fear
that
it
will
not
lead
very
far
we
found
however
as
we
advanced
that
this
portion
of
the
moor
is
intersected
with
soft
patches
and
though
we
frequently
lost
sight
of
the
track
we
always
succeeded
in
picking
it
up
once
more
do
you
observe
said
holmes
that
the
rider
is
now
undoubtedly
forcing
the
pace
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
it
look
at
this
impression
where
you
get
both
tyres
clear
the
one
is
as
deep
as
the
other
that
can
only
mean
that
the
rider
is
throwing
his
weight
on
to
the
handle
bar
as
man
does
when
he
is
sprinting
by
jove
he
has
had
fall
there
was
broad
irregular
smudge
covering
some
yards
of
the
track
then
there
were
few
footmarks
and
the
tyre
reappeared
once
more
side
slip
suggested
holmes
held
up
crumpled
branch
of
flowering
gorse
to
my
horror
perceived
that
the
yellow
blossoms
were
all
dabbled
with
crimson
on
the
path
too
and
among
the
heather
were
dark
stains
of
clotted
blood
bad
said
holmes
bad
stand
clear
watson
not
an
unnecessary
footstep
what
do
read
here
he
fell
wounded
he
stood
up
he
remounted
he
proceeded
but
there
is
no
other
track
cattle
on
this
side
path
he
was
surely
not
gored
by
bull
impossible
but
see
no
traces
of
anyone
else
we
must
push
on
watson
surely
with
stains
as
well
as
the
track
to
guide
us
he
cannot
escape
us
now
our
search
was
not
very
long
one
the
tracks
of
the
tyre
began
to
curve
fantastically
upon
the
wet
and
shining
path
suddenly
as
looked
ahead
the
gleam
of
metal
caught
my
eye
from
amid
the
thick
gorse
bushes
out
of
them
we
dragged
bicycle
palmer
tyred
one
pedal
bent
and
the
whole
front
of
it
horribly
smeared
and
slobbered
with
blood
on
the
other
side
of
the
bushes
shoe
was
projecting
we
ran
round
and
there
lay
the
unfortunate
rider
he
was
tall
man
full
bearded
with
spectacles
one
glass
of
which
had
been
knocked
out
the
cause
of
his
death
was
frightful
blow
upon
the
head
which
had
crushed
in
part
of
his
skull
that
he
could
have
gone
on
after
receiving
such
an
injury
said
much
for
the
vitality
and
courage
of
the
man
he
wore
shoes
but
no
socks
and
his
open
coat
disclosed
night
shirt
beneath
it
was
undoubtedly
the
german
master

holmes
turned
the
body
over
reverently
and
examined
it
with
great
attention
he
then
sat
in
deep
thought
for
time
and
could
see
by
his
ruffled
brow
that
this
grim
discovery
had
not
in
his
opinion
advanced
us
much
in
our
inquiry
it
is
little
difficult
to
know
what
to
do
watson
said
he
at
last
my
own
inclinations
are
to
push
this
inquiry
on
for
we
have
already
lost
so
much
time
that
we
cannot
afford
to
waste
another
hour
on
the
other
hand
we
are
bound
to
inform
the
police
of
the
discovery
and
to
see
that
this
poor
fellow
body
is
looked
after
could
take
note
back
but
need
your
company
and
assistance
wait
bit
there
is
fellow
cutting
peat
up
yonder
bring
him
over
here
and
he
will
guide
the
police
brought
the
peasant
across
and
holmes
dispatched
the
frightened
man
with
note
to
dr
huxtable
now
watson
said
he
we
have
picked
up
two
clues
this
morning
one
is
the
bicycle
with
the
palmer
tyre
and
we
see
what
that
has
led
to
the
other
is
the
bicycle
with
the
patched
dunlop
before
we
start
to
investigate
that
let
us
try
to
realize
what
we
do
know
so
as
to
make
the
most
of
it
and
to
separate
the
essential
from
the
accidental
first
of
all
wish
to
impress
upon
you
that
the
boy
certainly
left
of
his
own
free
will
he
got
down
from
his
window
and
he
went
off
either
alone
or
with
someone
that
is
sure
assented
well
now
let
us
turn
to
this
unfortunate
german
master
the
boy
was
fully
dressed
when
he
fled
therefore
he
foresaw
what
he
would
do
but
the
german
went
without
his
socks
he
certainly
acted
on
very
short
notice
undoubtedly
why
did
he
go
because
from
his
bedroom
window
he
saw
the
flight
of
the
boy
because
he
wished
to
overtake
him
and
bring
him
back
he
seized
his
bicycle
pursued
the
lad
and
in
pursuing
him
met
his
death
so
it
would
seem
now
come
to
the
critical
part
of
my
argument
the
natural
action
of
man
in
pursuing
little
boy
would
be
to
run
after
him
he
would
know
that
he
could
overtake
him
but
the
german
does
not
do
so
he
turns
to
his
bicycle
am
told
that
he
was
an
excellent
cyclist
he
would
not
do
this
if
he
did
not
see
that
the
boy
had
some
swift
means
of
escape
the
other
bicycle
let
us
continue
our
reconstruction
he
meets
his
death
five
miles
from
the
school
not
by
bullet
mark
you
which
even
lad
might
conceivably
discharge
but
by
savage
blow
dealt
by
vigorous
arm
the
lad
then
had
companion
in
his
flight
and
the
flight
was
swift
one
since
it
took
five
miles
before
an
expert
cyclist
could
overtake
them
yet
we
survey
the
ground
round
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
what
do
we
find
few
cattle
tracks
nothing
more
took
wide
sweep
round
and
there
is
no
path
within
fifty
yards
another
cyclist
could
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
actual
murder
nor
were
there
any
human
footmarks
holmes
cried
this
is
impossible
admirable
he
said
most
illuminating
remark
it
is
impossible
as
state
it
and
therefore
must
in
some
respect
have
stated
it
wrong
yet
you
saw
for
yourself
can
you
suggest
any
fallacy
he
could
not
have
fractured
his
skull
in
fall
in
morass
watson
am
at
my
wit
end
tut
we
have
solved
some
worse
problems
at
least
we
have
plenty
of
material
if
we
can
only
use
it
come
then
and
having
exhausted
the
palmer
let
us
see
what
the
dunlop
with
the
patched
cover
has
to
offer
us
we
picked
up
the
track
and
followed
it
onwards
for
some
distance
but
soon
the
moor
rose
into
long
heather
tufted
curve
and
we
left
the
watercourse
behind
us
no
further
help
from
tracks
could
be
hoped
for
at
the
spot
where
we
saw
the
last
of
the
dunlop
tyre
it
might
equally
have
led
to
holdernesse
hall
the
stately
towers
of
which
rose
some
miles
to
our
left
or
to
low
grey
village
which
lay
in
front
of
us
and
marked
the
position
of
the
chesterfield
high
road
as
we
approached
the
forbidding
and
squalid
inn
with
the
sign
of
game
cock
above
the
door
holmes
gave
sudden
groan
and
clutched
me
by
the
shoulder
to
save
himself
from
falling
he
had
one
of
those
violent
strains
of
the
ankle
which
leave
man
helpless
with
difficulty
he
limped
up
to
the
door
where
squat
dark
elderly
man
was
smoking
black
clay
pipe
how
are
you
mr
reuben
hayes
said
holmes
who
are
you
and
how
do
you
get
my
name
so
pat
the
countryman
answered
with
suspicious
flash
of
pair
of
cunning
eyes
well
it
printed
on
the
board
above
your
head
it
easy
to
see
man
who
is
master
of
his
own
house
suppose
you
haven
such
thing
as
carriage
in
your
stables
no
have
not
can
hardly
put
my
foot
to
the
ground
don
put
it
to
the
ground
but
can
walk
well
then
hop
mr
reuben
hayes
manner
was
far
from
gracious
but
holmes
took
it
with
admirable
good
humour
look
here
my
man
said
he
this
is
really
rather
an
awkward
fix
for
me
don
mind
how
get
on
neither
do
said
the
morose
landlord
the
matter
is
very
important
would
offer
you
sovereign
for
the
use
of
bicycle
the
landlord
pricked
up
his
ears
where
do
you
want
to
go
to
holdernesse
hall
pals
of
the
dook
suppose
said
the
landlord
surveying
our
mud
stained
garments
with
ironical
eyes
holmes
laughed
good
naturedly
he
ll
be
glad
to
see
us
anyhow
why
because
we
bring
him
news
of
his
lost
son
the
landlord
gave
very
visible
start
what
you
re
on
his
track
he
has
been
heard
of
in
liverpool
they
expect
to
get
him
every
hour
again
swift
change
passed
over
the
heavy
unshaven
face
his
manner
was
suddenly
genial
ve
less
reason
to
wish
the
dook
well
than
most
men
said
he
for
was
his
head
coachman
once
and
cruel
bad
he
treated
me
it
was
him
that
sacked
me
without
character
on
the
word
of
lying
corn
chandler
but
glad
to
hear
that
the
young
lord
was
heard
of
in
liverpool
and
ll
help
you
to
take
the
news
to
the
hall
thank
you
said
holmes
we
ll
have
some
food
first
then
you
can
bring
round
the
bicycle
haven
got
bicycle
holmes
held
up
sovereign
tell
you
man
that
haven
got
one
ll
let
you
have
two
horses
as
far
as
the
hall
well
said
holmes
we
ll
talk
about
it
when
we
ve
had
something
to
eat
when
we
were
left
alone
in
the
stone
flagged
kitchen
it
was
astonishing
how
rapidly
that
sprained
ankle
recovered
it
was
nearly
nightfall
and
we
had
eaten
nothing
since
early
morning
so
that
we
spent
some
time
over
our
meal
holmes
was
lost
in
thought
and
once
or
twice
he
walked
over
to
the
window
and
stared
earnestly
out
it
opened
on
to
squalid
courtyard
in
the
far
corner
was
smithy
where
grimy
lad
was
at
work
on
the
other
side
were
the
stables
holmes
had
sat
down
again
after
one
of
these
excursions
when
he
suddenly
sprang
out
of
his
chair
with
loud
exclamation
by
heaven
watson
believe
that
ve
got
it
he
cried
yes
it
must
be
so
watson
do
you
remember
seeing
any
cow
tracks
to
day
yes
several
where
well
everywhere
they
were
at
the
morass
and
again
on
the
path
and
again
near
where
poor
heidegger
met
his
death
exactly
well
now
watson
how
many
cows
did
you
see
on
the
moor
don
remember
seeing
any
strange
watson
that
we
should
see
tracks
all
along
our
line
but
never
cow
on
the
whole
moor
very
strange
watson
eh
yes
it
is
strange
now
watson
make
an
effort
throw
your
mind
back
can
you
see
those
tracks
upon
the
path
yes
can
you
recall
that
the
tracks
were
sometimes
like
that
watson
he
arranged
number
of
bread
crumbs
in
this
fashion
and
sometimes
like
this
and
occasionally
like
this
can
you
remember
that
no
cannot
but
can
could
swear
to
it
however
we
will
go
back
at
our
leisure
and
verify
it
what
blind
beetle
have
been
not
to
draw
my
conclusion
and
what
is
your
conclusion
only
that
it
is
remarkable
cow
which
walks
canters
and
gallops
by
george
watson
it
was
no
brain
of
country
publican
that
thought
out
such
blind
as
that
the
coast
seems
to
be
clear
save
for
that
lad
in
the
smithy
let
us
slip
out
and
see
what
we
can
see
there
were
two
rough
haired
unkempt
horses
in
the
tumble
down
stable
holmes
raised
the
hind
leg
of
one
of
them
and
laughed
aloud
old
shoes
but
newly
shod
old
shoes
but
new
nails
this
case
deserves
to
be
classic
let
us
go
across
to
the
smithy
the
lad
continued
his
work
without
regarding
us
saw
holmes
eye
darting
to
right
and
left
among
the
litter
of
iron
and
wood
which
was
scattered
about
the
floor
suddenly
however
we
heard
step
behind
us
and
there
was
the
landlord
his
heavy
eyebrows
drawn
over
his
savage
eyes
his
swarthy
features
convulsed
with
passion
he
held
short
metal
headed
stick
in
his
hand
and
he
advanced
in
so
menacing
fashion
that
was
right
glad
to
feel
the
revolver
in
my
pocket

you
infernal
spies
the
man
cried
what
are
you
doing
there
why
mr
reuben
hayes
said
holmes
coolly
one
might
think
that
you
were
afraid
of
our
finding
something
out
the
man
mastered
himself
with
violent
effort
and
his
grim
mouth
loosened
into
false
laugh
which
was
more
menacing
than
his
frown
you
re
welcome
to
all
you
can
find
out
in
my
smithy
said
he
but
look
here
mister
don
care
for
folk
poking
about
my
place
without
my
leave
so
the
sooner
you
pay
your
score
and
get
out
of
this
the
better
shall
be
pleased
all
right
mr
hayes
no
harm
meant
said
holmes
we
have
been
having
look
at
your
horses
but
think
ll
walk
after
all
it
not
far
believe
not
more
than
two
miles
to
the
hall
gates
that
the
road
to
the
left
he
watched
us
with
sullen
eyes
until
we
had
left
his
premises
we
did
not
go
very
far
along
the
road
for
holmes
stopped
the
instant
that
the
curve
hid
us
from
the
landlord
view
we
were
warm
as
the
children
say
at
that
inn
said
he
seem
to
grow
colder
every
step
that
take
away
from
it
no
can
possibly
leave
it
am
convinced
said
that
this
reuben
hayes
knows
all
about
it
more
self
evident
villain
never
saw
oh
he
impressed
you
in
that
way
did
he
there
are
the
horses
there
is
the
smithy
yes
it
is
an
interesting
place
this
fighting
cock
think
we
shall
have
another
look
at
it
in
an
unobtrusive
way
long
sloping
hillside
dotted
with
grey
limestone
boulders
stretched
behind
us
we
had
turned
off
the
road
and
were
making
our
way
up
the
hill
when
looking
in
the
direction
of
holdernesse
hall
saw
cyclist
coming
swiftly
along
get
down
watson
cried
holmes
with
heavy
hand
upon
my
shoulder
we
had
hardly
sunk
from
view
when
the
man
flew
past
us
on
the
road
amid
rolling
cloud
of
dust
caught
glimpse
of
pale
agitated
face
with
horror
in
every
lineament
the
mouth
open
the
eyes
staring
wildly
in
front
it
was
like
some
strange
caricature
of
the
dapper
james
wilder
whom
we
had
seen
the
night
before
the
duke
secretary
cried
holmes
come
watson
let
us
see
what
he
does
we
scrambled
from
rock
to
rock
until
in
few
moments
we
had
made
our
way
to
point
from
which
we
could
see
the
front
door
of
the
inn
wilder
bicycle
was
leaning
against
the
wall
beside
it
no
one
was
moving
about
the
house
nor
could
we
catch
glimpse
of
any
faces
at
the
windows
slowly
the
twilight
crept
down
as
the
sun
sank
behind
the
high
towers
of
holdernesse
hall
then
in
the
gloom
we
saw
the
two
side
lamps
of
trap
light
up
in
the
stable
yard
of
the
inn
and
shortly
afterwards
heard
the
rattle
of
hoofs
as
it
wheeled
out
into
the
road
and
tore
off
at
furious
pace
in
the
direction
of
chesterfield
what
do
you
make
of
that
watson
holmes
whispered
it
looks
like
flight
single
man
in
dog
cart
so
far
as
could
see
well
it
certainly
was
not
mr
james
wilder
for
there
he
is
at
the
door
red
square
of
light
had
sprung
out
of
the
darkness
in
the
middle
of
it
was
the
black
figure
of
the
secretary
his
head
advanced
peering
out
into
the
night
it
was
evident
that
he
was
expecting
someone
then
at
last
there
were
steps
in
the
road
second
figure
was
visible
for
an
instant
against
the
light
the
door
shut
and
all
was
black
once
more
five
minutes
later
lamp
was
lit
in
room
upon
the
first
floor
it
seems
to
be
curious
class
of
custom
that
is
done
by
the
fighting
cock
said
holmes
the
bar
is
on
the
other
side
quite
so
these
are
what
one
may
call
the
private
guests
now
what
in
the
world
is
mr
james
wilder
doing
in
that
den
at
this
hour
of
night
and
who
is
the
companion
who
comes
to
meet
him
there
come
watson
we
must
really
take
risk
and
try
to
investigate
this
little
more
closely
together
we
stole
down
to
the
road
and
crept
across
to
the
door
of
the
inn
the
bicycle
still
leaned
against
the
wall
holmes
struck
match
and
held
it
to
the
back
wheel
and
heard
him
chuckle
as
the
light
fell
upon
patched
dunlop
tyre
up
above
us
was
the
lighted
window
must
have
peep
through
that
watson
if
you
bend
your
back
and
support
yourself
upon
the
wall
think
that
can
manage
an
instant
later
his
feet
were
on
my
shoulders
but
he
was
hardly
up
before
he
was
down
again
come
my
friend
said
he
our
day
work
has
been
quite
long
enough
think
that
we
have
gathered
all
that
we
can
it
long
walk
to
the
school
and
the
sooner
we
get
started
the
better
he
hardly
opened
his
lips
during
that
weary
trudge
across
the
moor
nor
would
he
enter
the
school
when
he
reached
it
but
went
on
to
mackleton
station
whence
he
could
send
some
telegrams
late
at
night
heard
him
consoling
dr
huxtable
prostrated
by
the
tragedy
of
his
master
death
and
later
still
he
entered
my
room
as
alert
and
vigorous
as
he
had
been
when
he
started
in
the
morning
all
goes
well
my
friend
said
he
promise
that
before
to
morrow
evening
we
shall
have
reached
the
solution
of
the
mystery
at
eleven
clock
next
morning
my
friend
and
were
walking
up
the
famous
yew
avenue
of
holdernesse
hall
we
were
ushered
through
the
magnificent
elizabethan
doorway
and
into
his
grace
study
there
we
found
mr
james
wilder
demure
and
courtly
but
with
some
trace
of
that
wild
terror
of
the
night
before
still
lurking
in
his
furtive
eyes
and
in
his
twitching
features
you
have
come
to
see
his
grace
am
sorry
but
the
fact
is
that
the
duke
is
far
from
well
he
has
been
very
much
upset
by
the
tragic
news
we
received
telegram
from
dr
huxtable
yesterday
afternoon
which
told
us
of
your
discovery
must
see
the
duke
mr
wilder
but
he
is
in
his
room
then
must
go
to
his
room
believe
he
is
in
his
bed
will
see
him
there
holmes
cold
and
inexorable
manner
showed
the
secretary
that
it
was
useless
to
argue
with
him
very
good
mr
holmes
will
tell
him
that
you
are
here
after
half
an
hour
delay
the
great
nobleman
appeared
his
face
was
more
cadaverous
than
ever
his
shoulders
had
rounded
and
he
seemed
to
me
to
be
an
altogether
older
man
than
he
had
been
the
morning
before
he
greeted
us
with
stately
courtesy
and
seated
himself
at
his
desk
his
red
beard
streaming
down
on
to
the
table
well
mr
holmes
said
he
but
my
friend
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
secretary
who
stood
by
his
master
chair
think
your
grace
that
could
speak
more
freely
in
mr
wilder
absence
the
man
turned
shade
paler
and
cast
malignant
glance
at
holmes
if
your
grace
wishes
yes
you
had
better
go
now
mr
holmes
what
have
you
to
say
my
friend
waited
until
the
door
had
closed
behind
the
retreating
secretary
the
fact
is
your
grace
said
he
that
my
colleague
dr
watson
and
myself
had
an
assurance
from
dr
huxtable
that
reward
had
been
offered
in
this
case
should
like
to
have
this
confirmed
from
your
own
lips
certainly
mr
holmes
it
amounted
if
am
correctly
informed
to
five
thousand
pounds
to
anyone
who
will
tell
you
where
your
son
is
exactly
and
another
thousand
to
the
man
who
will
name
the
person
or
persons
who
keep
him
in
custody
exactly
under
the
latter
heading
is
included
no
doubt
not
only
those
who
may
have
taken
him
away
but
also
those
who
conspire
to
keep
him
in
his
present
position
yes
cried
the
duke
impatiently
if
you
do
your
work
well
mr
sherlock
holmes
you
will
have
no
reason
to
complain
of
niggardly
treatment
my
friend
rubbed
his
thin
hands
together
with
an
appearance
of
avidity
which
was
surprise
to
me
who
knew
his
frugal
tastes
fancy
that
see
your
grace
cheque
book
upon
the
table
said
he
should
be
glad
if
you
would
make
me
out
cheque
for
six
thousand
pounds
it
would
be
as
well
perhaps
for
you
to
cross
it
the
capital
and
counties
bank
oxford
street
branch
are
my
agents
his
grace
sat
very
stern
and
upright
in
his
chair
and
looked
stonily
at
my
friend
is
this
joke
mr
holmes
it
is
hardly
subject
for
pleasantry
not
at
all
your
grace
was
never
more
earnest
in
my
life
what
do
you
mean
then
mean
that
have
earned
the
reward
know
where
your
son
is
and
know
some
at
least
of
those
who
are
holding
him
the
duke
beard
had
turned
more
aggressively
red
than
ever
against
his
ghastly
white
face
where
is
he
gasped
he
is
or
was
last
night
at
the
fighting
cock
inn
about
two
miles
from
your
park
gate
the
duke
fell
back
in
his
chair
and
whom
do
you
accuse
sherlock
holmes
answer
was
an
astounding
one
he
stepped
swiftly
forward
and
touched
the
duke
upon
the
shoulder
accuse
you
said
he
and
now
your
grace
ll
trouble
you
for
that
cheque

never
shall
forget
the
duke
appearance
as
he
sprang
up
and
clawed
with
his
hands
like
one
who
is
sinking
into
an
abyss
then
with
an
extraordinary
effort
of
aristocratic
self
command
he
sat
down
and
sank
his
face
in
his
hands
it
was
some
minutes
before
he
spoke
how
much
do
you
know
he
asked
at
last
without
raising
his
head
saw
you
together
last
night
does
anyone
else
besides
your
friend
know
have
spoken
to
no
one
the
duke
took
pen
in
his
quivering
fingers
and
opened
his
cheque
book
shall
be
as
good
as
my
word
mr
holmes
am
about
to
write
your
cheque
however
unwelcome
the
information
which
you
have
gained
may
be
to
me
when
the
offer
was
first
made
little
thought
the
turn
which
events
might
take
but
you
and
your
friend
are
men
of
discretion
mr
holmes
hardly
understand
your
grace
must
put
it
plainly
mr
holmes
if
only
you
two
know
of
this
incident
there
is
no
reason
why
it
should
go
any
farther
think
twelve
thousand
pounds
is
the
sum
that
owe
you
is
it
not
but
holmes
smiled
and
shook
his
head
fear
your
grace
that
matters
can
hardly
be
arranged
so
easily
there
is
the
death
of
this
schoolmaster
to
be
accounted
for
but
james
knew
nothing
of
that
you
cannot
hold
him
responsible
for
that
it
was
the
work
of
this
brutal
ruffian
whom
he
had
the
misfortune
to
employ
must
take
the
view
your
grace
that
when
man
embarks
upon
crime
he
is
morally
guilty
of
any
other
crime
which
may
spring
from
it
morally
mr
holmes
no
doubt
you
are
right
but
surely
not
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
man
cannot
be
condemned
for
murder
at
which
he
was
not
present
and
which
he
loathes
and
abhors
as
much
as
you
do
the
instant
that
he
heard
of
it
he
made
complete
confession
to
me
so
filled
was
he
with
horror
and
remorse
he
lost
not
an
hour
in
breaking
entirely
with
the
murderer
oh
mr
holmes
you
must
save
him
you
must
save
him
tell
you
that
you
must
save
him
the
duke
had
dropped
the
last
attempt
at
self
command
and
was
pacing
the
room
with
convulsed
face
and
with
his
clenched
hands
raving
in
the
air
at
last
he
mastered
himself
and
sat
down
once
more
at
his
desk
appreciate
your
conduct
in
coming
here
before
you
spoke
to
anyone
else
said
he
at
least
we
may
take
counsel
how
far
we
can
minimize
this
hideous
scandal
exactly
said
holmes
think
your
grace
that
this
can
only
be
done
by
absolute
and
complete
frankness
between
us
am
disposed
to
help
your
grace
to
the
best
of
my
ability
but
in
order
to
do
so
must
understand
to
the
last
detail
how
the
matter
stands
realize
that
your
words
applied
to
mr
james
wilder
and
that
he
is
not
the
murderer
no
the
murderer
has
escaped
sherlock
holmes
smiled
demurely
your
grace
can
hardly
have
heard
of
any
small
reputation
which
possess
or
you
would
not
imagine
that
it
is
so
easy
to
escape
me
mr
reuben
hayes
was
arrested
at
chesterfield
on
my
information
at
eleven
clock
last
night
had
telegram
from
the
head
of
the
local
police
before
left
the
school
this
morning
the
duke
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
stared
with
amazement
at
my
friend
you
seem
to
have
powers
that
are
hardly
human
said
he
so
reuben
hayes
is
taken
am
right
glad
to
hear
it
if
it
will
not
react
upon
the
fate
of
james
your
secretary
no
sir
my
son
it
was
holmes
turn
to
look
astonished
confess
that
this
is
entirely
new
to
me
your
grace
must
beg
you
to
be
more
explicit
will
conceal
nothing
from
you
agree
with
you
that
complete
frankness
however
painful
it
may
be
to
me
is
the
best
policy
in
this
desperate
situation
to
which
james
folly
and
jealousy
have
reduced
us
when
was
very
young
man
mr
holmes
loved
with
such
love
as
comes
only
once
in
lifetime
offered
the
lady
marriage
but
she
refused
it
on
the
grounds
that
such
match
might
mar
my
career
had
she
lived
would
certainly
never
have
married
anyone
else
she
died
and
left
this
one
child
whom
for
her
sake
have
cherished
and
cared
for
could
not
acknowledge
the
paternity
to
the
world
but
gave
him
the
best
of
educations
and
since
he
came
to
manhood
have
kept
him
near
my
person
he
surprised
my
secret
and
has
presumed
ever
since
upon
the
claim
which
he
has
upon
me
and
upon
his
power
of
provoking
scandal
which
would
be
abhorrent
to
me
his
presence
had
something
to
do
with
the
unhappy
issue
of
my
marriage
above
all
he
hated
my
young
legitimate
heir
from
the
first
with
persistent
hatred
you
may
well
ask
me
why
under
these
circumstances
still
kept
james
under
my
roof
answer
that
it
was
because
could
see
his
mother
face
in
his
and
that
for
her
dear
sake
there
was
no
end
to
my
long
suffering
all
her
pretty
ways
too
there
was
not
one
of
them
which
he
could
not
suggest
and
bring
back
to
my
memory
could
not
send
him
away
but
feared
so
much
lest
he
should
do
arthur
that
is
lord
saltire
mischief
that
dispatched
him
for
safety
to
dr
huxtable
school
james
came
into
contact
with
this
fellow
hayes
because
the
man
was
tenant
of
mine
and
james
acted
as
agent
the
fellow
was
rascal
from
the
beginning
but
in
some
extraordinary
way
james
became
intimate
with
him
he
had
always
taste
for
low
company
when
james
determined
to
kidnap
lord
saltire
it
was
of
this
man
service
that
he
availed
himself
you
remember
that
wrote
to
arthur
upon
that
last
day
well
james
opened
the
letter
and
inserted
note
asking
arthur
to
meet
him
in
little
wood
called
the
ragged
shaw
which
is
near
to
the
school
he
used
the
duchess
name
and
in
that
way
got
the
boy
to
come
that
evening
james
bicycled
over
am
telling
you
what
he
has
himself
confessed
to
me
and
he
told
arthur
whom
he
met
in
the
wood
that
his
mother
longed
to
see
him
that
she
was
awaiting
him
on
the
moor
and
that
if
he
would
come
back
into
the
wood
at
midnight
he
would
find
man
with
horse
who
would
take
him
to
her
poor
arthur
fell
into
the
trap
he
came
to
the
appointment
and
found
this
fellow
hayes
with
led
pony
arthur
mounted
and
they
set
off
together
it
appears
though
this
james
only
heard
yesterday
that
they
were
pursued
that
hayes
struck
the
pursuer
with
his
stick
and
that
the
man
died
of
his
injuries
hayes
brought
arthur
to
his
public
house
the
fighting
cock
where
he
was
confined
in
an
upper
room
under
the
care
of
mrs
hayes
who
is
kindly
woman
but
entirely
under
the
control
of
her
brutal
husband
well
mr
holmes
that
was
the
state
of
affairs
when
first
saw
you
two
days
ago
had
no
more
idea
of
the
truth
than
you
will
ask
me
what
was
james
motive
in
doing
such
deed
answer
that
there
was
great
deal
which
was
unreasoning
and
fanatical
in
the
hatred
which
he
bore
my
heir
in
his
view
he
should
himself
have
been
heir
of
all
my
estates
and
he
deeply
resented
those
social
laws
which
made
it
impossible
at
the
same
time
he
had
definite
motive
also
he
was
eager
that
should
break
the
entail
and
he
was
of
opinion
that
it
lay
in
my
power
to
do
so
he
intended
to
make
bargain
with
me
to
restore
arthur
if
would
break
the
entail
and
so
make
it
possible
for
the
estate
to
be
left
to
him
by
will
he
knew
well
that
should
never
willingly
invoke
the
aid
of
the
police
against
him
say
that
he
would
have
proposed
such
bargain
to
me
but
he
did
not
actually
do
so
for
events
moved
too
quickly
for
him
and
he
had
not
time
to
put
his
plans
into
practice
what
brought
all
his
wicked
scheme
to
wreck
was
your
discovery
of
this
man
heidegger
dead
body
james
was
seized
with
horror
at
the
news
it
came
to
us
yesterday
as
we
sat
together
in
this
study
dr
huxtable
had
sent
telegram
james
was
so
overwhelmed
with
grief
and
agitation
that
my
suspicions
which
had
never
been
entirely
absent
rose
instantly
to
certainty
and
taxed
him
with
the
deed
he
made
complete
voluntary
confession
then
he
implored
me
to
keep
his
secret
for
three
days
longer
so
as
to
give
his
wretched
accomplice
chance
of
saving
his
guilty
life
yielded
as
have
always
yielded
to
his
prayers
and
instantly
james
hurried
off
to
the
fighting
cock
to
warn
hayes
and
give
him
the
means
of
flight
could
not
go
there
by
daylight
without
provoking
comment
but
as
soon
as
night
fell
hurried
off
to
see
my
dear
arthur
found
him
safe
and
well
but
horrified
beyond
expression
by
the
dreadful
deed
he
had
witnessed
in
deference
to
my
promise
and
much
against
my
will
consented
to
leave
him
there
for
three
days
under
the
charge
of
mrs
hayes
since
it
was
evident
that
it
was
impossible
to
inform
the
police
where
he
was
without
telling
them
also
who
was
the
murderer
and
could
not
see
how
that
murderer
could
be
punished
without
ruin
to
my
unfortunate
james
you
asked
for
frankness
mr
holmes
and
have
taken
you
at
your
word
for
have
now
told
you
everything
without
an
attempt
at
circumlocution
or
concealment
do
you
in
turn
be
as
frank
with
me

will
said
holmes
in
the
first
place
your
grace
am
bound
to
tell
you
that
you
have
placed
yourself
in
most
serious
position
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
you
have
condoned
felony
and
you
have
aided
the
escape
of
murderer
for
cannot
doubt
that
any
money
which
was
taken
by
james
wilder
to
aid
his
accomplice
in
his
flight
came
from
your
grace
purse
the
duke
bowed
his
assent
this
is
indeed
most
serious
matter
even
more
culpable
in
my
opinion
your
grace
is
your
attitude
towards
your
younger
son
you
leave
him
in
this
den
for
three
days
under
solemn
promises
what
are
promises
to
such
people
as
these
you
have
no
guarantee
that
he
will
not
be
spirited
away
again
to
humour
your
guilty
elder
son
you
have
exposed
your
innocent
younger
son
to
imminent
and
unnecessary
danger
it
was
most
unjustifiable
action
the
proud
lord
of
holdernesse
was
not
accustomed
to
be
so
rated
in
his
own
ducal
hall
the
blood
flushed
into
his
high
forehead
but
his
conscience
held
him
dumb
will
help
you
but
on
one
condition
only
it
is
that
you
ring
for
the
footman
and
let
me
give
such
orders
as
like
without
word
the
duke
pressed
the
electric
bell
servant
entered
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
said
holmes
that
your
young
master
is
found
it
is
the
duke
desire
that
the
carriage
shall
go
at
once
to
the
fighting
cock
inn
to
bring
lord
saltire
home
now
said
holmes
when
the
rejoicing
lackey
had
disappeared
having
secured
the
future
we
can
afford
to
be
more
lenient
with
the
past
am
not
in
an
official
position
and
there
is
no
reason
so
long
as
the
ends
of
justice
are
served
why
should
disclose
all
that
know
as
to
hayes
say
nothing
the
gallows
awaits
him
and
would
do
nothing
to
save
him
from
it
what
he
will
divulge
cannot
tell
but
have
no
doubt
that
your
grace
could
make
him
understand
that
it
is
to
his
interest
to
be
silent
from
the
police
point
of
view
he
will
have
kidnapped
the
boy
for
the
purpose
of
ransom
if
they
do
not
themselves
find
it
out
see
no
reason
why
should
prompt
them
to
take
broader
point
of
view
would
warn
your
grace
however
that
the
continued
presence
of
mr
james
wilder
in
your
household
can
only
lead
to
misfortune
understand
that
mr
holmes
and
it
is
already
settled
that
he
shall
leave
me
for
ever
and
go
to
seek
his
fortune
in
australia
in
that
case
your
grace
since
you
have
yourself
stated
that
any
unhappiness
in
your
married
life
was
caused
by
his
presence
would
suggest
that
you
make
such
amends
as
you
can
to
the
duchess
and
that
you
try
to
resume
those
relations
which
have
been
so
unhappily
interrupted
that
also
have
arranged
mr
holmes
wrote
to
the
duchess
this
morning
in
that
case
said
holmes
rising
think
that
my
friend
and
can
congratulate
ourselves
upon
several
most
happy
results
from
our
little
visit
to
the
north
there
is
one
other
small
point
upon
which
desire
some
light
this
fellow
hayes
had
shod
his
horses
with
shoes
which
counterfeited
the
tracks
of
cows
was
it
from
mr
wilder
that
he
learned
so
extraordinary
device
the
duke
stood
in
thought
for
moment
with
look
of
intense
surprise
on
his
face
then
he
opened
door
and
showed
us
into
large
room
furnished
as
museum
he
led
the
way
to
glass
case
in
corner
and
pointed
to
the
inscription
these
shoes
it
ran
were
dug
up
in
the
moat
of
holdernesse
hall
they
are
for
the
use
of
horses
but
they
are
shaped
below
with
cloven
foot
of
iron
so
as
to
throw
pursuers
off
the
track
they
are
supposed
to
have
belonged
to
some
of
the
marauding
barons
of
holdernesse
in
the
middle
ages
holmes
opened
the
case
and
moistening
his
finger
he
passed
it
along
the
shoe
thin
film
of
recent
mud
was
left
upon
his
skin
thank
you
said
he
as
he
replaced
the
glass
it
is
the
second
most
interesting
object
that
have
seen
in
the
north
and
the
first
holmes
folded
up
his
cheque
and
placed
it
carefully
in
his
note
book
am
poor
man
said
he
as
he
patted
it
affectionately
and
thrust
it
into
the
depths
of
his
inner
pocket
vi
the
adventure
of
black
peter
have
never
known
my
friend
to
be
in
better
form
both
mental
and
physical
than
in
the
year
95
his
increasing
fame
had
brought
with
it
an
immense
practice
and
should
be
guilty
of
an
indiscretion
if
were
even
to
hint
at
the
identity
of
some
of
the
illustrious
clients
who
crossed
our
humble
threshold
in
baker
street
holmes
however
like
all
great
artists
lived
for
his
art
sake
and
save
in
the
case
of
the
duke
of
holdernesse
have
seldom
known
him
claim
any
large
reward
for
his
inestimable
services
so
unworldly
was
he
or
so
capricious
that
he
frequently
refused
his
help
to
the
powerful
and
wealthy
where
the
problem
made
no
appeal
to
his
sympathies
while
he
would
devote
weeks
of
most
intense
application
to
the
affairs
of
some
humble
client
whose
case
presented
those
strange
and
dramatic
qualities
which
appealed
to
his
imagination
and
challenged
his
ingenuity
in
this
memorable
year
95
curious
and
incongruous
succession
of
cases
had
engaged
his
attention
ranging
from
his
famous
investigation
of
the
sudden
death
of
cardinal
tosca
an
inquiry
which
was
carried
out
by
him
at
the
express
desire
of
his
holiness
the
pope
down
to
his
arrest
of
wilson
the
notorious
canary
trainer
which
removed
plague
spot
from
the
east
end
of
london
close
on
the
heels
of
these
two
famous
cases
came
the
tragedy
of
woodman
lee
and
the
very
obscure
circumstances
which
surrounded
the
death
of
captain
peter
carey
no
record
of
the
doings
of
mr
sherlock
holmes
would
be
complete
which
did
not
include
some
account
of
this
very
unusual
affair
during
the
first
week
of
july
my
friend
had
been
absent
so
often
and
so
long
from
our
lodgings
that
knew
he
had
something
on
hand
the
fact
that
several
rough
looking
men
called
during
that
time
and
inquired
for
captain
basil
made
me
understand
that
holmes
was
working
somewhere
under
one
of
the
numerous
disguises
and
names
with
which
he
concealed
his
own
formidable
identity
he
had
at
least
five
small
refuges
in
different
parts
of
london
in
which
he
was
able
to
change
his
personality
he
said
nothing
of
his
business
to
me
and
it
was
not
my
habit
to
force
confidence
the
first
positive
sign
which
he
gave
me
of
the
direction
which
his
investigation
was
taking
was
an
extraordinary
one
he
had
gone
out
before
breakfast
and
had
sat
down
to
mine
when
he
strode
into
the
room
his
hat
upon
his
head
and
huge
barbed
headed
spear
tucked
like
an
umbrella
under
his
arm
good
gracious
holmes
cried
you
don
mean
to
say
that
you
have
been
walking
about
london
with
that
thing
drove
to
the
butcher
and
back
the
butcher
and
return
with
an
excellent
appetite
there
can
be
no
question
my
dear
watson
of
the
value
of
exercise
before
breakfast
but
am
prepared
to
bet
that
you
will
not
guess
the
form
that
my
exercise
has
taken
will
not
attempt
it
he
chuckled
as
he
poured
out
the
coffee
if
you
could
have
looked
into
allardyce
back
shop
you
would
have
seen
dead
pig
swung
from
hook
in
the
ceiling
and
gentleman
in
his
shirt
sleeves
furiously
stabbing
at
it
with
this
weapon
was
that
energetic
person
and
have
satisfied
myself
that
by
no
exertion
of
my
strength
can
transfix
the
pig
with
single
blow
perhaps
you
would
care
to
try
not
for
worlds
but
why
were
you
doing
this
because
it
seemed
to
me
to
have
an
indirect
bearing
upon
the
mystery
of
woodman
lee
ah
hopkins
got
your
wire
last
night
and
have
been
expecting
you
come
and
join
us
our
visitor
was
an
exceedingly
alert
man
thirty
years
of
age
dressed
in
quiet
tweed
suit
but
retaining
the
erect
bearing
of
one
who
was
accustomed
to
official
uniform
recognised
him
at
once
as
stanley
hopkins
young
police
inspector
for
whose
future
holmes
had
high
hopes
while
he
in
turn
professed
the
admiration
and
respect
of
pupil
for
the
scientific
methods
of
the
famous
amateur
hopkins
brow
was
clouded
and
he
sat
down
with
an
air
of
deep
dejection
no
thank
you
sir
breakfasted
before
came
round
spent
the
night
in
town
for
came
up
yesterday
to
report
and
what
had
you
to
report
failure
sir
absolute
failure
you
have
made
no
progress
none
dear
me
must
have
look
at
the
matter
wish
to
heavens
that
you
would
mr
holmes
it
my
first
big
chance
and
am
at
my
wit
end
for
goodness
sake
come
down
and
lend
me
hand
well
it
just
happens
that
have
already
read
all
the
available
evidence
including
the
report
of
the
inquest
with
some
care
by
the
way
what
do
you
make
of
that
tobacco
pouch
found
on
the
scene
of
the
crime
is
there
no
clue
there
hopkins
looked
surprised

it
was
the
man
own
pouch
sir
his
initials
were
inside
it
and
it
was
of
seal
skin
and
he
an
old
sealer
but
he
had
no
pipe
no
sir
we
could
find
no
pipe
indeed
he
smoked
very
little
and
yet
he
might
have
kept
some
tobacco
for
his
friends
no
doubt
only
mention
it
because
if
had
been
handling
the
case
should
have
been
inclined
to
make
that
the
starting
point
of
my
investigation
however
my
friend
dr
watson
knows
nothing
of
this
matter
and
should
be
none
the
worse
for
hearing
the
sequence
of
events
once
more
just
give
us
some
short
sketch
of
the
essentials
stanley
hopkins
drew
slip
of
paper
from
his
pocket
have
few
dates
here
which
will
give
you
the
career
of
the
dead
man
captain
peter
carey
he
was
born
in
45
fifty
years
of
age
he
was
most
daring
and
successful
seal
and
whale
fisher
in
1883
he
commanded
the
steam
sealer
sea
unicorn
of
dundee
he
had
then
had
several
successful
voyages
in
succession
and
in
the
following
year
1884
he
retired
after
that
he
travelled
for
some
years
and
finally
he
bought
small
place
called
woodman
lee
near
forest
row
in
sussex
there
he
has
lived
for
six
years
and
there
he
died
just
week
ago
to
day
there
were
some
most
singular
points
about
the
man
in
ordinary
life
he
was
strict
puritan
silent
gloomy
fellow
his
household
consisted
of
his
wife
his
daughter
aged
twenty
and
two
female
servants
these
last
were
continually
changing
for
it
was
never
very
cheery
situation
and
sometimes
it
became
past
all
bearing
the
man
was
an
intermittent
drunkard
and
when
he
had
the
fit
on
him
he
was
perfect
fiend
he
has
been
known
to
drive
his
wife
and
his
daughter
out
of
doors
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
flog
them
through
the
park
until
the
whole
village
outside
the
gates
was
aroused
by
their
screams
he
was
summoned
once
for
savage
assault
upon
the
old
vicar
who
had
called
upon
him
to
remonstrate
with
him
upon
his
conduct
in
short
mr
holmes
you
would
go
far
before
you
found
more
dangerous
man
than
peter
carey
and
have
heard
that
he
bore
the
same
character
when
he
commanded
his
ship
he
was
known
in
the
trade
as
black
peter
and
the
name
was
given
him
not
only
on
account
of
his
swarthy
features
and
the
colour
of
his
huge
beard
but
for
the
humours
which
were
the
terror
of
all
around
him
need
not
say
that
he
was
loathed
and
avoided
by
every
one
of
his
neighbours
and
that
have
not
heard
one
single
word
of
sorrow
about
his
terrible
end
you
must
have
read
in
the
account
of
the
inquest
about
the
man
cabin
mr
holmes
but
perhaps
your
friend
here
has
not
heard
of
it
he
had
built
himself
wooden
outhouse
he
always
called
it
the
cabin
few
hundred
yards
from
his
house
and
it
was
here
that
he
slept
every
night
it
was
little
single
roomed
hut
sixteen
feet
by
ten
he
kept
the
key
in
his
pocket
made
his
own
bed
cleaned
it
himself
and
allowed
no
other
foot
to
cross
the
threshold
there
are
small
windows
on
each
side
which
were
covered
by
curtains
and
never
opened
one
of
these
windows
was
turned
towards
the
high
road
and
when
the
light
burned
in
it
at
night
the
folk
used
to
point
it
out
to
each
other
and
wonder
what
black
peter
was
doing
in
there
that
the
window
mr
holmes
which
gave
us
one
of
the
few
bits
of
positive
evidence
that
came
out
at
the
inquest
you
remember
that
stonemason
named
slater
walking
from
forest
row
about
one
clock
in
the
morning
two
days
before
the
murder
stopped
as
he
passed
the
grounds
and
looked
at
the
square
of
light
still
shining
among
the
trees
he
swears
that
the
shadow
of
man
head
turned
sideways
was
clearly
visible
on
the
blind
and
that
this
shadow
was
certainly
not
that
of
peter
carey
whom
he
knew
well
it
was
that
of
bearded
man
but
the
beard
was
short
and
bristled
forwards
in
way
very
different
from
that
of
the
captain
so
he
says
but
he
had
been
two
hours
in
the
public
house
and
it
is
some
distance
from
the
road
to
the
window
besides
this
refers
to
the
monday
and
the
crime
was
done
upon
the
wednesday
on
the
tuesday
peter
carey
was
in
one
of
his
blackest
moods
flushed
with
drink
and
as
savage
as
dangerous
wild
beast
he
roamed
about
the
house
and
the
women
ran
for
it
when
they
heard
him
coming
late
in
the
evening
he
went
down
to
his
own
hut
about
two
clock
the
following
morning
his
daughter
who
slept
with
her
window
open
heard
most
fearful
yell
from
that
direction
but
it
was
no
unusual
thing
for
him
to
bawl
and
shout
when
he
was
in
drink
so
no
notice
was
taken
on
rising
at
seven
one
of
the
maids
noticed
that
the
door
of
the
hut
was
open
but
so
great
was
the
terror
which
the
man
caused
that
it
was
midday
before
anyone
would
venture
down
to
see
what
had
become
of
him
peeping
into
the
open
door
they
saw
sight
which
sent
them
flying
with
white
faces
into
the
village
within
an
hour
was
on
the
spot
and
had
taken
over
the
case
well
have
fairly
steady
nerves
as
you
know
mr
holmes
but
give
you
my
word
that
got
shake
when
put
my
head
into
that
little
house
it
was
droning
like
harmonium
with
the
flies
and
bluebottles
and
the
floor
and
walls
were
like
slaughter
house
he
had
called
it
cabin
and
cabin
it
was
sure
enough
for
you
would
have
thought
that
you
were
in
ship
there
was
bunk
at
one
end
sea
chest
maps
and
charts
picture
of
the
sea
unicorn
line
of
log
books
on
shelf
all
exactly
as
one
would
expect
to
find
it
in
captain
room
and
there
in
the
middle
of
it
was
the
man
himself
his
face
twisted
like
lost
soul
in
torment
and
his
great
brindled
beard
stuck
upwards
in
his
agony
right
through
his
broad
breast
steel
harpoon
had
been
driven
and
it
had
sunk
deep
into
the
wood
of
the
wall
behind
him
he
was
pinned
like
beetle
on
card
of
course
he
was
quite
dead
and
had
been
so
from
the
instant
that
he
had
uttered
that
last
yell
of
agony
know
your
methods
sir
and
applied
them
before
permitted
anything
to
be
moved
examined
most
carefully
the
ground
outside
and
also
the
floor
of
the
room
there
were
no
footmarks
meaning
that
you
saw
none
assure
you
sir
that
there
were
none
my
good
hopkins
have
investigated
many
crimes
but
have
never
yet
seen
one
which
was
committed
by
flying
creature
as
long
as
the
criminal
remains
upon
two
legs
so
long
must
there
be
some
indentation
some
abrasion
some
trifling
displacement
which
can
be
detected
by
the
scientific
searcher
it
is
incredible
that
this
blood
bespattered
room
contained
no
trace
which
could
have
aided
us
understand
however
from
the
inquest
that
there
were
some
objects
which
you
failed
to
overlook
the
young
inspector
winced
at
my
companion
ironical
comments
was
fool
not
to
call
you
in
at
the
time
mr
holmes
however
that
past
praying
for
now
yes
there
were
several
objects
in
the
room
which
called
for
special
attention
one
was
the
harpoon
with
which
the
deed
was
committed
it
had
been
snatched
down
from
rack
on
the
wall
two
others
remained
there
and
there
was
vacant
place
for
the
third
on
the
stock
was
engraved
ss
sea
unicorn
dundee
this
seemed
to
establish
that
the
crime
had
been
done
in
moment
of
fury
and
that
the
murderer
had
seized
the
first
weapon
which
came
in
his
way
the
fact
that
the
crime
was
committed
at
two
in
the
morning
and
yet
peter
carey
was
fully
dressed
suggested
that
he
had
an
appointment
with
the
murderer
which
is
borne
out
by
the
fact
that
bottle
of
rum
and
two
dirty
glasses
stood
upon
the
table
yes
said
holmes
think
that
both
inferences
are
permissible
was
there
any
other
spirit
but
rum
in
the
room
yes
there
was
tantalus
containing
brandy
and
whisky
on
the
sea
chest
it
is
of
no
importance
to
us
however
since
the
decanters
were
full
and
it
had
therefore
not
been
used
for
all
that
its
presence
has
some
significance
said
holmes
however
let
us
hear
some
more
about
the
objects
which
do
seem
to
you
to
bear
upon
the
case
there
was
this
tobacco
pouch
upon
the
table
what
part
of
the
table
it
lay
in
the
middle
it
was
of
coarse
seal
skin
the
straight
haired
skin
with
leather
thong
to
bind
it
inside
was
on
the
flap
there
was
half
an
ounce
of
strong
ship
tobacco
in
it
excellent
what
more
stanley
hopkins
drew
from
his
pocket
drab
covered
note
book
the
outside
was
rough
and
worn
the
leaves
discoloured
on
the
first
page
were
written
the
initials
and
the
date
1883
holmes
laid
it
on
the
table
and
examined
it
in
his
minute
way
while
hopkins
and
gazed
over
each
shoulder
on
the
second
page
were
the
printed
letters
and
then
came
several
sheets
of
numbers
another
heading
was
argentine
another
costa
rica
and
another
san
paulo
each
with
pages
of
signs
and
figures
after
it
what
do
you
make
of
these
asked
holmes
they
appear
to
be
lists
of
stock
exchange
securities
thought
that
were
the
initials
of
broker
and
that
may
have
been
his
client

said
holmes
stanley
hopkins
swore
between
his
teeth
and
struck
his
thigh
with
his
clenched
hand
what
fool
have
been
he
cried
of
course
it
is
as
you
say
then
are
the
only
initials
we
have
to
solve
have
already
examined
the
old
stock
exchange
lists
and
can
find
no
one
in
1883
either
in
the
house
or
among
the
outside
brokers
whose
initials
correspond
with
these
yet
feel
that
the
clue
is
the
most
important
one
that
hold
you
will
admit
mr
holmes
that
there
is
possibility
that
these
initials
are
those
of
the
second
person
who
was
present
in
other
words
of
the
murderer
would
also
urge
that
the
introduction
into
the
case
of
document
relating
to
large
masses
of
valuable
securities
gives
us
for
the
first
time
some
indication
of
motive
for
the
crime
sherlock
holmes
face
showed
that
he
was
thoroughly
taken
aback
by
this
new
development
must
admit
both
your
points
said
he
confess
that
this
note
book
which
did
not
appear
at
the
inquest
modifies
any
views
which
may
have
formed
had
come
to
theory
of
the
crime
in
which
can
find
no
place
for
this
have
you
endeavoured
to
trace
any
of
the
securities
here
mentioned
inquiries
are
now
being
made
at
the
offices
but
fear
that
the
complete
register
of
the
stockholders
of
these
south
american
concerns
is
in
south
america
and
that
some
weeks
must
elapse
before
we
can
trace
the
shares
holmes
had
been
examining
the
cover
of
the
note
book
with
his
magnifying
lens
surely
there
is
some
discolouration
here
said
he
yes
sir
it
is
blood
stain
told
you
that
picked
the
book
off
the
floor
was
the
blood
stain
above
or
below
on
the
side
next
the
boards
which
proves
of
course
that
the
book
was
dropped
after
the
crime
was
committed
exactly
mr
holmes
appreciated
that
point
and
conjectured
that
it
was
dropped
by
the
murderer
in
his
hurried
flight
it
lay
near
the
door
suppose
that
none
of
these
securities
have
been
found
among
the
property
of
the
dead
man
no
sir
have
you
any
reason
to
suspect
robbery
no
sir
nothing
seemed
to
have
been
touched
dear
me
it
is
certainly
very
interesting
case
then
there
was
knife
was
there
not
sheath
knife
still
in
its
sheath
it
lay
at
the
feet
of
the
dead
man
mrs
carey
has
identified
it
as
being
her
husband
property
holmes
was
lost
in
thought
for
some
time
well
said
he
at
last
suppose
shall
have
to
come
out
and
have
look
at
it
stanley
hopkins
gave
cry
of
joy
thank
you
sir
that
will
indeed
be
weight
off
my
mind
holmes
shook
his
finger
at
the
inspector
it
would
have
been
an
easier
task
week
ago
said
he
but
even
now
my
visit
may
not
be
entirely
fruitless
watson
if
you
can
spare
the
time
should
be
very
glad
of
your
company
if
you
will
call
four
wheeler
hopkins
we
shall
be
ready
to
start
for
forest
row
in
quarter
of
an
hour
alighting
at
the
small
wayside
station
we
drove
for
some
miles
through
the
remains
of
widespread
woods
which
were
once
part
of
that
great
forest
which
for
so
long
held
the
saxon
invaders
at
bay
the
impenetrable
weald
for
sixty
years
the
bulwark
of
britain
vast
sections
of
it
have
been
cleared
for
this
is
the
seat
of
the
first
iron
works
of
the
country
and
the
trees
have
been
felled
to
smelt
the
ore
now
the
richer
fields
of
the
north
have
absorbed
the
trade
and
nothing
save
these
ravaged
groves
and
great
scars
in
the
earth
show
the
work
of
the
past
here
in
clearing
upon
the
green
slope
of
hill
stood
long
low
stone
house
approached
by
curving
drive
running
through
the
fields
nearer
the
road
and
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
bushes
was
small
outhouse
one
window
and
the
door
facing
in
our
direction
it
was
the
scene
of
the
murder
stanley
hopkins
led
us
first
to
the
house
where
he
introduced
us
to
haggard
grey
haired
woman
the
widow
of
the
murdered
man
whose
gaunt
and
deep
lined
face
with
the
furtive
look
of
terror
in
the
depths
of
her
red
rimmed
eyes
told
of
the
years
of
hardship
and
ill
usage
which
she
had
endured
with
her
was
her
daughter
pale
fair
haired
girl
whose
eyes
blazed
defiantly
at
us
as
she
told
us
that
she
was
glad
that
her
father
was
dead
and
that
she
blessed
the
hand
which
had
struck
him
down
it
was
terrible
household
that
black
peter
carey
had
made
for
himself
and
it
was
with
sense
of
relief
that
we
found
ourselves
in
the
sunlight
again
and
making
our
way
along
path
which
had
been
worn
across
the
fields
by
the
feet
of
the
dead
man
the
outhouse
was
the
simplest
of
dwellings
wooden
walled
shingle
roofed
one
window
beside
the
door
and
one
on
the
farther
side
stanley
hopkins
drew
the
key
from
his
pocket
and
had
stooped
to
the
lock
when
he
paused
with
look
of
attention
and
surprise
upon
his
face
someone
has
been
tampering
with
it
he
said
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
fact
the
woodwork
was
cut
and
the
scratches
showed
white
through
the
paint
as
if
they
had
been
that
instant
done
holmes
had
been
examining
the
window
someone
has
tried
to
force
this
also
whoever
it
was
has
failed
to
make
his
way
in
he
must
have
been
very
poor
burglar
this
is
most
extraordinary
thing
said
the
inspector
could
swear
that
these
marks
were
not
here
yesterday
evening
some
curious
person
from
the
village
perhaps
suggested
very
unlikely
few
of
them
would
dare
to
set
foot
in
the
grounds
far
less
try
to
force
their
way
into
the
cabin
what
do
you
think
of
it
mr
holmes
think
that
fortune
is
very
kind
to
us
you
mean
that
the
person
will
come
again
it
is
very
probable
he
came
expecting
to
find
the
door
open
he
tried
to
get
in
with
the
blade
of
very
small
penknife
he
could
not
manage
it
what
would
he
do
come
again
next
night
with
more
useful
tool
so
should
say
it
will
be
our
fault
if
we
are
not
there
to
receive
him
meanwhile
let
me
see
the
inside
of
the
cabin
the
traces
of
the
tragedy
had
been
removed
but
the
furniture
within
the
little
room
still
stood
as
it
had
been
on
the
night
of
the
crime
for
two
hours
with
most
intense
concentration
holmes
examined
every
object
in
turn
but
his
face
showed
that
his
quest
was
not
successful
one
once
only
he
paused
in
his
patient
investigation
have
you
taken
anything
off
this
shelf
hopkins
no
have
moved
nothing
something
has
been
taken
there
is
less
dust
in
this
corner
of
the
shelf
than
elsewhere
it
may
have
been
book
lying
on
its
side
it
may
have
been
box
well
can
do
nothing
more
let
us
walk
in
these
beautiful
woods
watson
and
give
few
hours
to
the
birds
and
the
flowers
we
shall
meet
you
here
later
hopkins
and
see
if
we
can
come
to
closer
quarters
with
the
gentleman
who
has
paid
this
visit
in
the
night
it
was
past
eleven
clock
when
we
formed
our
little
ambuscade
hopkins
was
for
leaving
the
door
of
the
hut
open
but
holmes
was
of
the
opinion
that
this
would
rouse
the
suspicions
of
the
stranger
the
lock
was
perfectly
simple
one
and
only
strong
blade
was
needed
to
push
it
back
holmes
also
suggested
that
we
should
wait
not
inside
the
hut
but
outside
it
among
the
bushes
which
grew
round
the
farther
window
in
this
way
we
should
be
able
to
watch
our
man
if
he
struck
light
and
see
what
his
object
was
in
this
stealthy
nocturnal
visit
it
was
long
and
melancholy
vigil
and
yet
brought
with
it
something
of
the
thrill
which
the
hunter
feels
when
he
lies
beside
the
water
pool
and
waits
for
the
coming
of
the
thirsty
beast
of
prey
what
savage
creature
was
it
which
might
steal
upon
us
out
of
the
darkness
was
it
fierce
tiger
of
crime
which
could
only
be
taken
fighting
hard
with
flashing
fang
and
claw
or
would
it
prove
to
be
some
skulking
jackal
dangerous
only
to
the
weak
and
unguarded
in
absolute
silence
we
crouched
amongst
the
bushes
waiting
for
whatever
might
come
at
first
the
steps
of
few
belated
villagers
or
the
sound
of
voices
from
the
village
lightened
our
vigil
but
one
by
one
these
interruptions
died
away
and
an
absolute
stillness
fell
upon
us
save
for
the
chimes
of
the
distant
church
which
told
us
of
the
progress
of
the
night
and
for
the
rustle
and
whisper
of
fine
rain
falling
amid
the
foliage
which
roofed
us
in
half
past
two
had
chimed
and
it
was
the
darkest
hour
which
precedes
the
dawn
when
we
all
started
as
low
but
sharp
click
came
from
the
direction
of
the
gate
someone
had
entered
the
drive
again
there
was
long
silence
and
had
begun
to
fear
that
it
was
false
alarm
when
stealthy
step
was
heard
upon
the
other
side
of
the
hut
and
moment
later
metallic
scraping
and
clinking
the
man
was
trying
to
force
the
lock
this
time
his
skill
was
greater
or
his
tool
was
better
for
there
was
sudden
snap
and
the
creak
of
the
hinges
then
match
was
struck
and
next
instant
the
steady
light
from
candle
filled
the
interior
of
the
hut
through
the
gauze
curtain
our
eyes
were
all
riveted
upon
the
scene
within

the
nocturnal
visitor
was
young
man
frail
and
thin
with
black
moustache
which
intensified
the
deadly
pallor
of
his
face
he
could
not
have
been
much
above
twenty
years
of
age
have
never
seen
any
human
being
who
appeared
to
be
in
such
pitiable
fright
for
his
teeth
were
visibly
chattering
and
he
was
shaking
in
every
limb
he
was
dressed
like
gentleman
in
norfolk
jacket
and
knickerbockers
with
cloth
cap
upon
his
head
we
watched
him
staring
round
with
frightened
eyes
then
he
laid
the
candle
end
upon
the
table
and
disappeared
from
our
view
into
one
of
the
corners
he
returned
with
large
book
one
of
the
log
books
which
formed
line
upon
the
shelves
leaning
on
the
table
he
rapidly
turned
over
the
leaves
of
this
volume
until
he
came
to
the
entry
which
he
sought
then
with
an
angry
gesture
of
his
clenched
hand
he
closed
the
book
replaced
it
in
the
corner
and
put
out
the
light
he
had
hardly
turned
to
leave
the
hut
when
hopkins
hand
was
on
the
fellow
collar
and
heard
his
loud
gasp
of
terror
as
he
understood
that
he
was
taken
the
candle
was
re
lit
and
there
was
our
wretched
captive
shivering
and
cowering
in
the
grasp
of
the
detective
he
sank
down
upon
the
sea
chest
and
looked
helplessly
from
one
of
us
to
the
other
now
my
fine
fellow
said
stanley
hopkins
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
here
the
man
pulled
himself
together
and
faced
us
with
an
effort
at
self
composure
you
are
detectives
suppose
said
he
you
imagine
am
connected
with
the
death
of
captain
peter
carey
assure
you
that
am
innocent
we
ll
see
about
that
said
hopkins
first
of
all
what
is
your
name
it
is
john
hopley
neligan
saw
holmes
and
hopkins
exchange
quick
glance
what
are
you
doing
here
can
speak
confidentially
no
certainly
not
why
should
tell
you
if
you
have
no
answer
it
may
go
badly
with
you
at
the
trial
the
young
man
winced
well
will
tell
you
he
said
why
should
not
and
yet
hate
to
think
of
this
old
scandal
gaining
new
lease
of
life
did
you
ever
hear
of
dawson
and
neligan
could
see
from
hopkins
face
that
he
never
had
but
holmes
was
keenly
interested
you
mean
the
west
country
bankers
said
he
they
failed
for
million
ruined
half
the
county
families
of
cornwall
and
neligan
disappeared
exactly
neligan
was
my
father
at
last
we
were
getting
something
positive
and
yet
it
seemed
long
gap
between
an
absconding
banker
and
captain
peter
carey
pinned
against
the
wall
with
one
of
his
own
harpoons
we
all
listened
intently
to
the
young
man
words
it
was
my
father
who
was
really
concerned
dawson
had
retired
was
only
ten
years
of
age
at
the
time
but
was
old
enough
to
feel
the
shame
and
horror
of
it
all
it
has
always
been
said
that
my
father
stole
all
the
securities
and
fled
it
is
not
true
it
was
his
belief
that
if
he
were
given
time
in
which
to
realize
them
all
would
be
well
and
every
creditor
paid
in
full
he
started
in
his
little
yacht
for
norway
just
before
the
warrant
was
issued
for
his
arrest
can
remember
that
last
night
when
he
bade
farewell
to
my
mother
he
left
us
list
of
the
securities
he
was
taking
and
he
swore
that
he
would
come
back
with
his
honour
cleared
and
that
none
who
had
trusted
him
would
suffer
well
no
word
was
ever
heard
from
him
again
both
the
yacht
and
he
vanished
utterly
we
believed
my
mother
and
that
he
and
it
with
the
securities
that
he
had
taken
with
him
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
we
had
faithful
friend
however
who
is
business
man
and
it
was
he
who
discovered
some
time
ago
that
some
of
the
securities
which
my
father
had
with
him
have
reappeared
on
the
london
market
you
can
imagine
our
amazement
spent
months
in
trying
to
trace
them
and
at
last
after
many
doublings
and
difficulties
discovered
that
the
original
seller
had
been
captain
peter
carey
the
owner
of
this
hut
naturally
made
some
inquiries
about
the
man
found
that
he
had
been
in
command
of
whaler
which
was
due
to
return
from
the
arctic
seas
at
the
very
time
when
my
father
was
crossing
to
norway
the
autumn
of
that
year
was
stormy
one
and
there
was
long
succession
of
southerly
gales
my
father
yacht
may
well
have
been
blown
to
the
north
and
there
met
by
captain
peter
carey
ship
if
that
were
so
what
had
become
of
my
father
in
any
case
if
could
prove
from
peter
carey
evidence
how
these
securities
came
on
the
market
it
would
be
proof
that
my
father
had
not
sold
them
and
that
he
had
no
view
to
personal
profit
when
he
took
them
came
down
to
sussex
with
the
intention
of
seeing
the
captain
but
it
was
at
this
moment
that
his
terrible
death
occurred
read
at
the
inquest
description
of
his
cabin
in
which
it
stated
that
the
old
log
books
of
his
vessel
were
preserved
in
it
struck
me
that
if
could
see
what
occurred
in
the
month
of
august
1883
on
board
the
sea
unicorn
might
settle
the
mystery
of
my
father
fate
tried
last
night
to
get
at
these
log
books
but
was
unable
to
open
the
door
to
night
tried
again
and
succeeded
but
find
that
the
pages
which
deal
with
that
month
have
been
torn
from
the
book
it
was
at
that
moment
found
myself
prisoner
in
your
hands
is
that
all
asked
hopkins
yes
that
is
all
his
eyes
shifted
as
he
said
it
you
have
nothing
else
to
tell
us
he
hesitated
no
there
is
nothing
you
have
not
been
here
before
last
night
no
then
how
do
you
account
for
that
cried
hopkins
as
he
held
up
the
damning
note
book
with
the
initials
of
our
prisoner
on
the
first
leaf
and
the
blood
stain
on
the
cover
the
wretched
man
collapsed
he
sank
his
face
in
his
hands
and
trembled
all
over
where
did
you
get
it
he
groaned
did
not
know
thought
had
lost
it
at
the
hotel
that
is
enough
said
hopkins
sternly
whatever
else
you
have
to
say
you
must
say
in
court
you
will
walk
down
with
me
now
to
the
police
station
well
mr
holmes
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
and
to
your
friend
for
coming
down
to
help
me
as
it
turns
out
your
presence
was
unnecessary
and
would
have
brought
the
case
to
this
successful
issue
without
you
but
none
the
less
am
very
grateful
rooms
have
been
reserved
for
you
at
the
brambletye
hotel
so
we
can
all
walk
down
to
the
village
together
well
watson
what
do
you
think
of
it
asked
holmes
as
we
travelled
back
next
morning
can
see
that
you
are
not
satisfied
oh
yes
my
dear
watson
am
perfectly
satisfied
at
the
same
time
stanley
hopkins
methods
do
not
commend
themselves
to
me
am
disappointed
in
stanley
hopkins
had
hoped
for
better
things
from
him
one
should
always
look
for
possible
alternative
and
provide
against
it
is
the
first
rule
of
criminal
investigation
what
then
is
the
alternative
the
line
of
investigation
which
have
myself
been
pursuing
it
may
give
us
nothing
cannot
tell
but
at
least
shall
follow
it
to
the
end
several
letters
were
waiting
for
holmes
at
baker
street
he
snatched
one
of
them
up
opened
it
and
burst
out
into
triumphant
chuckle
of
laughter
excellent
watson
the
alternative
develops
have
you
telegraph
forms
just
write
couple
of
messages
for
me
sumner
shipping
agent
ratcliff
highway
send
three
men
on
to
arrive
ten
to
morrow
morning
basil
that
my
name
in
those
parts
the
other
is
inspector
stanley
hopkins
46
lord
street
brixton
come
breakfast
to
morrow
at
nine
thirty
important
wire
if
unable
to
come
sherlock
holmes
there
watson
this
infernal
case
has
haunted
me
for
ten
days
hereby
banish
it
completely
from
my
presence
to
morrow
trust
that
we
shall
hear
the
last
of
it
for
ever
sharp
at
the
hour
named
inspector
stanley
hopkins
appeared
and
we
sat
down
together
to
the
excellent
breakfast
which
mrs
hudson
had
prepared
the
young
detective
was
in
high
spirits
at
his
success
you
really
think
that
your
solution
must
be
correct
asked
holmes
could
not
imagine
more
complete
case
it
did
not
seem
to
me
conclusive
you
astonish
me
mr
holmes
what
more
could
one
ask
for
does
your
explanation
cover
every
point
undoubtedly
find
that
young
neligan
arrived
at
the
brambletye
hotel
on
the
very
day
of
the
crime
he
came
on
the
pretence
of
playing
golf
his
room
was
on
the
ground
floor
and
he
could
get
out
when
he
liked
that
very
night
he
went
down
to
woodman
lee
saw
peter
carey
at
the
hut
quarrelled
with
him
and
killed
him
with
the
harpoon
then
horrified
by
what
he
had
done
he
fled
out
of
the
hut
dropping
the
note
book
which
he
had
brought
with
him
in
order
to
question
peter
carey
about
these
different
securities
you
may
have
observed
that
some
of
them
were
marked
with
ticks
and
the
others
the
great
majority
were
not
those
which
are
ticked
have
been
traced
on
the
london
market
but
the
others
presumably
were
still
in
the
possession
of
carey
and
young
neligan
according
to
his
own
account
was
anxious
to
recover
them
in
order
to
do
the
right
thing
by
his
father
creditors
after
his
flight
he
did
not
dare
to
approach
the
hut
again
for
some
time
but
at
last
he
forced
himself
to
do
so
in
order
to
obtain
the
information
which
he
needed
surely
that
is
all
simple
and
obvious

holmes
smiled
and
shook
his
head
it
seems
to
me
to
have
only
one
drawback
hopkins
and
that
is
that
it
is
intrinsically
impossible
have
you
tried
to
drive
harpoon
through
body
no
tut
my
dear
sir
you
must
really
pay
attention
to
these
details
my
friend
watson
could
tell
you
that
spent
whole
morning
in
that
exercise
it
is
no
easy
matter
and
requires
strong
and
practised
arm
but
this
blow
was
delivered
with
such
violence
that
the
head
of
the
weapon
sank
deep
into
the
wall
do
you
imagine
that
this
anaemic
youth
was
capable
of
so
frightful
an
assault
is
he
the
man
who
hobnobbed
in
rum
and
water
with
black
peter
in
the
dead
of
the
night
was
it
his
profile
that
was
seen
on
the
blind
two
nights
before
no
hopkins
it
is
another
and
more
formidable
person
for
whom
we
must
seek
the
detective
face
had
grown
longer
and
longer
during
holmes
speech
his
hopes
and
his
ambitions
were
all
crumbling
about
him
but
he
would
not
abandon
his
position
without
struggle
you
can
deny
that
neligan
was
present
that
night
mr
holmes
the
book
will
prove
that
fancy
that
have
evidence
enough
to
satisfy
jury
even
if
you
are
able
to
pick
hole
in
it
besides
mr
holmes
have
laid
my
hand
upon
my
man
as
to
this
terrible
person
of
yours
where
is
he
rather
fancy
that
he
is
on
the
stair
said
holmes
serenely
think
watson
that
you
would
do
well
to
put
that
revolver
where
you
can
reach
it
he
rose
and
laid
written
paper
upon
side
table
now
we
are
ready
said
he
there
had
been
some
talking
in
gruff
voices
outside
and
now
mrs
hudson
opened
the
door
to
say
that
there
were
three
men
inquiring
for
captain
basil
show
them
in
one
by
one
said
holmes
the
first
who
entered
was
little
ribston
pippin
of
man
with
ruddy
cheeks
and
fluffy
white
side
whiskers
holmes
had
drawn
letter
from
his
pocket
what
name
he
asked
james
lancaster
am
sorry
lancaster
but
the
berth
is
full
here
is
half
sovereign
for
your
trouble
just
step
into
this
room
and
wait
there
for
few
minutes
the
second
man
was
long
dried
up
creature
with
lank
hair
and
sallow
cheeks
his
name
was
hugh
pattins
he
also
received
his
dismissal
his
half
sovereign
and
the
order
to
wait
the
third
applicant
was
man
of
remarkable
appearance
fierce
bull
dog
face
was
framed
in
tangle
of
hair
and
beard
and
two
bold
dark
eyes
gleamed
behind
the
cover
of
thick
tufted
overhung
eyebrows
he
saluted
and
stood
sailor
fashion
turning
his
cap
round
in
his
hands
your
name
asked
holmes
patrick
cairns
harpooner
yes
sir
twenty
six
voyages
dundee
suppose
yes
sir
and
ready
to
start
with
an
exploring
ship
yes
sir
what
wages
eight
pounds
month
could
you
start
at
once
as
soon
as
get
my
kit
have
you
your
papers
yes
sir
he
took
sheaf
of
worn
and
greasy
forms
from
his
pocket
holmes
glanced
over
them
and
returned
them
you
are
just
the
man
want
said
he
here
the
agreement
on
the
side
table
if
you
sign
it
the
whole
matter
will
be
settled
the
seaman
lurched
across
the
room
and
took
up
the
pen
shall
sign
here
he
asked
stooping
over
the
table
holmes
leaned
over
his
shoulder
and
passed
both
hands
over
his
neck
this
will
do
said
he
heard
click
of
steel
and
bellow
like
an
enraged
bull
the
next
instant
holmes
and
the
seaman
were
rolling
on
the
ground
together
he
was
man
of
such
gigantic
strength
that
even
with
the
handcuffs
which
holmes
had
so
deftly
fastened
upon
his
wrists
he
would
have
very
quickly
overpowered
my
friend
had
hopkins
and
not
rushed
to
his
rescue
only
when
pressed
the
cold
muzzle
of
the
revolver
to
his
temple
did
he
at
last
understand
that
resistance
was
vain
we
lashed
his
ankles
with
cord
and
rose
breathless
from
the
struggle
must
really
apologize
hopkins
said
sherlock
holmes
fear
that
the
scrambled
eggs
are
cold
however
you
will
enjoy
the
rest
of
your
breakfast
all
the
better
will
you
not
for
the
thought
that
you
have
brought
your
case
to
triumphant
conclusion
stanley
hopkins
was
speechless
with
amazement
don
know
what
to
say
mr
holmes
he
blurted
out
at
last
with
very
red
face
it
seems
to
me
that
have
been
making
fool
of
myself
from
the
beginning
understand
now
what
should
never
have
forgotten
that
am
the
pupil
and
you
are
the
master
even
now
see
what
you
have
done
but
don
know
how
you
did
it
or
what
it
signifies
well
said
holmes
good
humouredly
we
all
learn
by
experience
and
your
lesson
this
time
is
that
you
should
never
lose
sight
of
the
alternative
you
were
so
absorbed
in
young
neligan
that
you
could
not
spare
thought
to
patrick
cairns
the
true
murderer
of
peter
carey
the
hoarse
voice
of
the
seaman
broke
in
on
our
conversation
see
here
mister
said
he
make
no
complaint
of
being
man
handled
in
this
fashion
but
would
have
you
call
things
by
their
right
names
you
say
murdered
peter
carey
say
killed
peter
carey
and
there
all
the
difference
maybe
you
don
believe
what
say
maybe
you
think
am
just
slinging
you
yarn
not
at
all
said
holmes
let
us
hear
what
you
have
to
say
it
soon
told
and
by
the
lord
every
word
of
it
is
truth
knew
black
peter
and
when
he
pulled
out
his
knife
whipped
harpoon
through
him
sharp
for
knew
that
it
was
him
or
me
that
how
he
died
you
can
call
it
murder
anyhow
as
soon
die
with
rope
round
my
neck
as
with
black
peter
knife
in
my
heart
how
came
you
there
asked
holmes
ll
tell
it
you
from
the
beginning
just
sit
me
up
little
so
as
can
speak
easy
it
was
in
83
that
it
happened
august
of
that
year
peter
carey
was
master
of
the
sea
unicorn
and
was
spare
harpooner
we
were
coming
out
of
the
ice
pack
on
our
way
home
with
head
winds
and
week
southerly
gale
when
we
picked
up
little
craft
that
had
been
blown
north
there
was
one
man
on
her
landsman
the
crew
had
thought
she
would
founder
and
had
made
for
the
norwegian
coast
in
the
dinghy
guess
they
were
all
drowned
well
we
took
him
on
board
this
man
and
he
and
the
skipper
had
some
long
talks
in
the
cabin
all
the
baggage
we
took
off
with
him
was
one
tin
box
so
far
as
know
the
man
name
was
never
mentioned
and
on
the
second
night
he
disappeared
as
if
he
had
never
been
it
was
given
out
that
he
had
either
thrown
himself
overboard
or
fallen
overboard
in
the
heavy
weather
that
we
were
having
only
one
man
knew
what
had
happened
to
him
and
that
was
me
for
with
my
own
eyes
saw
the
skipper
tip
up
his
heels
and
put
him
over
the
rail
in
the
middle
watch
of
dark
night
two
days
before
we
sighted
the
shetland
lights
well
kept
my
knowledge
to
myself
and
waited
to
see
what
would
come
of
it
when
we
got
back
to
scotland
it
was
easily
hushed
up
and
nobody
asked
any
questions
stranger
died
by
an
accident
and
it
was
nobody
business
to
inquire
shortly
after
peter
carey
gave
up
the
sea
and
it
was
long
years
before
could
find
where
he
was
guessed
that
he
had
done
the
deed
for
the
sake
of
what
was
in
that
tin
box
and
that
he
could
afford
now
to
pay
me
well
for
keeping
my
mouth
shut
found
out
where
he
was
through
sailor
man
that
had
met
him
in
london
and
down
went
to
squeeze
him
the
first
night
he
was
reasonable
enough
and
was
ready
to
give
me
what
would
make
me
free
of
the
sea
for
life
we
were
to
fix
it
all
two
nights
later
when
came
found
him
three
parts
drunk
and
in
vile
temper
we
sat
down
and
we
drank
and
we
yarned
about
old
times
but
the
more
he
drank
the
less
liked
the
look
on
his
face
spotted
that
harpoon
upon
the
wall
and
thought
might
need
it
before
was
through
then
at
last
he
broke
out
at
me
spitting
and
cursing
with
murder
in
his
eyes
and
great
clasp
knife
in
his
hand
he
had
not
time
to
get
it
from
the
sheath
before
had
the
harpoon
through
him
heavens
what
yell
he
gave
and
his
face
gets
between
me
and
my
sleep
stood
there
with
his
blood
splashing
round
me
and
waited
for
bit
but
all
was
quiet
so
took
heart
once
more
looked
round
and
there
was
the
tin
box
on
shelf
had
as
much
right
to
it
as
peter
carey
anyhow
so
took
it
with
me
and
left
the
hut
like
fool
left
my
baccy
pouch
upon
the
table
now
ll
tell
you
the
queerest
part
of
the
whole
story
had
hardly
got
outside
the
hut
when
heard
someone
coming
and
hid
among
the
bushes
man
came
slinking
along
went
into
the
hut
gave
cry
as
if
he
had
seen
ghost
and
legged
it
as
hard
as
he
could
run
until
he
was
out
of
sight
who
he
was
or
what
he
wanted
is
more
than
can
tell
for
my
part
walked
ten
miles
got
train
at
tunbridge
wells
and
so
reached
london
and
no
one
the
wiser
well
when
came
to
examine
the
box
found
there
was
no
money
in
it
and
nothing
but
papers
that
would
not
dare
to
sell
had
lost
my
hold
on
black
peter
and
was
stranded
in
london
without
shilling
there
was
only
my
trade
left
saw
these
advertisements
about
harpooners
and
high
wages
so
went
to
the
shipping
agents
and
they
sent
me
here
that
all
know
and
say
again
that
if
killed
black
peter
the
law
should
give
me
thanks
for
saved
them
the
price
of
hempen

very
clear
statement
said
holmes
rising
and
lighting
his
pipe
think
hopkins
that
you
should
lose
no
time
in
conveying
your
prisoner
to
place
of
safety
this
room
is
not
well
adapted
for
cell
and
mr
patrick
cairns
occupies
too
large
proportion
of
our
carpet
mr
holmes
said
hopkins
do
not
know
how
to
express
my
gratitude
even
now
do
not
understand
how
you
attained
this
result
simply
by
having
the
good
fortune
to
get
the
right
clue
from
the
beginning
it
is
very
possible
if
had
known
about
this
note
book
it
might
have
led
away
my
thoughts
as
it
did
yours
but
all
heard
pointed
in
the
one
direction
the
amazing
strength
the
skill
in
the
use
of
the
harpoon
the
rum
and
water
the
seal
skin
tobacco
pouch
with
the
coarse
tobacco
all
these
pointed
to
seaman
and
one
who
had
been
whaler
was
convinced
that
the
initials
upon
the
pouch
were
coincidence
and
not
those
of
peter
carey
since
he
seldom
smoked
and
no
pipe
was
found
in
his
cabin
you
remember
that
asked
whether
whisky
and
brandy
were
in
the
cabin
you
said
they
were
how
many
landsmen
are
there
who
would
drink
rum
when
they
could
get
these
other
spirits
yes
was
certain
it
was
seaman
and
how
did
you
find
him
my
dear
sir
the
problem
had
become
very
simple
one
if
it
were
seaman
it
could
only
be
seaman
who
had
been
with
him
on
the
sea
unicorn
so
far
as
could
learn
he
had
sailed
in
no
other
ship
spent
three
days
in
wiring
to
dundee
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
had
ascertained
the
names
of
the
crew
of
the
sea
unicorn
in
1883
when
found
patrick
cairns
among
the
harpooners
my
research
was
nearing
its
end
argued
that
the
man
was
probably
in
london
and
that
he
would
desire
to
leave
the
country
for
time
therefore
spent
some
days
in
the
east
end
devised
an
arctic
expedition
put
forth
tempting
terms
for
harpooners
who
would
serve
under
captain
basil
and
behold
the
result
wonderful
cried
hopkins
wonderful
you
must
obtain
the
release
of
young
neligan
as
soon
as
possible
said
holmes
confess
that
think
you
owe
him
some
apology
the
tin
box
must
be
returned
to
him
but
of
course
the
securities
which
peter
carey
has
sold
are
lost
for
ever
there
the
cab
hopkins
and
you
can
remove
your
man
if
you
want
me
for
the
trial
my
address
and
that
of
watson
will
be
somewhere
in
norway
ll
send
particulars
later
vii
the
adventure
of
charles
augustus
milverton
it
is
years
since
the
incidents
of
which
speak
took
place
and
yet
it
is
with
diffidence
that
allude
to
them
for
long
time
even
with
the
utmost
discretion
and
reticence
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
make
the
facts
public
but
now
the
principal
person
concerned
is
beyond
the
reach
of
human
law
and
with
due
suppression
the
story
may
be
told
in
such
fashion
as
to
injure
no
one
it
records
an
absolutely
unique
experience
in
the
career
both
of
mr
sherlock
holmes
and
of
myself
the
reader
will
excuse
me
if
conceal
the
date
or
any
other
fact
by
which
he
might
trace
the
actual
occurrence
we
had
been
out
for
one
of
our
evening
rambles
holmes
and
had
returned
about
six
clock
on
cold
frosty
winter
evening
as
holmes
turned
up
the
lamp
the
light
fell
upon
card
on
the
table
he
glanced
at
it
and
then
with
an
ejaculation
of
disgust
threw
it
on
the
floor
picked
it
up
and
read
charles
augustus
milverton
appledore
towers
agent
hampstead
who
is
he
asked
the
worst
man
in
london
holmes
answered
as
he
sat
down
and
stretched
his
legs
before
the
fire
is
anything
on
the
back
of
the
card
turned
it
over
will
call
at
30
read
hum
he
about
due
do
you
feel
creeping
shrinking
sensation
watson
when
you
stand
before
the
serpents
in
the
zoo
and
see
the
slithery
gliding
venomous
creatures
with
their
deadly
eyes
and
wicked
flattened
faces
well
that
how
milverton
impresses
me
ve
had
to
do
with
fifty
murderers
in
my
career
but
the
worst
of
them
never
gave
me
the
repulsion
which
have
for
this
fellow
and
yet
can
get
out
of
doing
business
with
him
indeed
he
is
here
at
my
invitation
but
who
is
he
ll
tell
you
watson
he
is
the
king
of
all
the
blackmailers
heaven
help
the
man
and
still
more
the
woman
whose
secret
and
reputation
come
into
the
power
of
milverton
with
smiling
face
and
heart
of
marble
he
will
squeeze
and
squeeze
until
he
has
drained
them
dry
the
fellow
is
genius
in
his
way
and
would
have
made
his
mark
in
some
more
savoury
trade
his
method
is
as
follows
he
allows
it
to
be
known
that
he
is
prepared
to
pay
very
high
sums
for
letters
which
compromise
people
of
wealth
or
position
he
receives
these
wares
not
only
from
treacherous
valets
or
maids
but
frequently
from
genteel
ruffians
who
have
gained
the
confidence
and
affection
of
trusting
women
he
deals
with
no
niggard
hand
happen
to
know
that
he
paid
seven
hundred
pounds
to
footman
for
note
two
lines
in
length
and
that
the
ruin
of
noble
family
was
the
result
everything
which
is
in
the
market
goes
to
milverton
and
there
are
hundreds
in
this
great
city
who
turn
white
at
his
name
no
one
knows
where
his
grip
may
fall
for
he
is
far
too
rich
and
far
too
cunning
to
work
from
hand
to
mouth
he
will
hold
card
back
for
years
in
order
to
play
it
at
the
moment
when
the
stake
is
best
worth
winning
have
said
that
he
is
the
worst
man
in
london
and
would
ask
you
how
could
one
compare
the
ruffian
who
in
hot
blood
bludgeons
his
mate
with
this
man
who
methodically
and
at
his
leisure
tortures
the
soul
and
wrings
the
nerves
in
order
to
add
to
his
already
swollen
money
bags
had
seldom
heard
my
friend
speak
with
such
intensity
of
feeling
but
surely
said
the
fellow
must
be
within
the
grasp
of
the
law
technically
no
doubt
but
practically
not
what
would
it
profit
woman
for
example
to
get
him
few
months
imprisonment
if
her
own
ruin
must
immediately
follow
his
victims
dare
not
hit
back
if
ever
he
blackmailed
an
innocent
person
then
indeed
we
should
have
him
but
he
is
as
cunning
as
the
evil
one
no
we
must
find
other
ways
to
fight
him
and
why
is
he
here
because
an
illustrious
client
has
placed
her
piteous
case
in
my
hands
it
is
the
lady
eva
brackwell
the
most
beautiful
debutante
of
last
season
she
is
to
be
married
in
fortnight
to
the
earl
of
dovercourt
this
fiend
has
several
imprudent
letters
imprudent
watson
nothing
worse
which
were
written
to
an
impecunious
young
squire
in
the
country
they
would
suffice
to
break
off
the
match
milverton
will
send
the
letters
to
the
earl
unless
large
sum
of
money
is
paid
him
have
been
commissioned
to
meet
him
and
to
make
the
best
terms
can
at
that
instant
there
was
clatter
and
rattle
in
the
street
below
looking
down
saw
stately
carriage
and
pair
the
brilliant
lamps
gleaming
on
the
glossy
haunches
of
the
noble
chestnuts
footman
opened
the
door
and
small
stout
man
in
shaggy
astrachan
overcoat
descended
minute
later
he
was
in
the
room
charles
augustus
milverton
was
man
of
fifty
with
large
intellectual
head
round
plump
hairless
face
perpetual
frozen
smile
and
two
keen
grey
eyes
which
gleamed
brightly
from
behind
broad
golden
rimmed
glasses
there
was
something
of
mr
pickwick
benevolence
in
his
appearance
marred
only
by
the
insincerity
of
the
fixed
smile
and
by
the
hard
glitter
of
those
restless
and
penetrating
eyes
his
voice
was
as
smooth
and
suave
as
his
countenance
as
he
advanced
with
plump
little
hand
extended
murmuring
his
regret
for
having
missed
us
at
his
first
visit
holmes
disregarded
the
outstretched
hand
and
looked
at
him
with
face
of
granite
milverton
smile
broadened
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
removed
his
overcoat
folded
it
with
great
deliberation
over
the
back
of
chair
and
then
took
seat
this
gentleman
said
he
with
wave
in
my
direction
is
it
discreet
is
it
right
dr
watson
is
my
friend
and
partner
very
good
mr
holmes
it
is
only
in
your
client
interests
that
protested
the
matter
is
so
very
delicate
dr
watson
has
already
heard
of
it
then
we
can
proceed
to
business
you
say
that
you
are
acting
for
lady
eva
has
she
empowered
you
to
accept
my
terms
what
are
your
terms
seven
thousand
pounds
and
the
alternative
my
dear
sir
it
is
painful
for
me
to
discuss
it
but
if
the
money
is
not
paid
on
the
14th
there
certainly
will
be
no
marriage
on
the
18th
his
insufferable
smile
was
more
complacent
than
ever
holmes
thought
for
little
you
appear
to
me
he
said
at
last
to
be
taking
matters
too
much
for
granted
am
of
course
familiar
with
the
contents
of
these
letters
my
client
will
certainly
do
what
may
advise
shall
counsel
her
to
tell
her
future
husband
the
whole
story
and
to
trust
to
his
generosity

milverton
chuckled
you
evidently
do
not
know
the
earl
said
he
from
the
baffled
look
upon
holmes
face
could
see
clearly
that
he
did
what
harm
is
there
in
the
letters
he
asked
they
are
sprightly
very
sprightly
milverton
answered
the
lady
was
charming
correspondent
but
can
assure
you
that
the
earl
of
dovercourt
would
fail
to
appreciate
them
however
since
you
think
otherwise
we
will
let
it
rest
at
that
it
is
purely
matter
of
business
if
you
think
that
it
is
in
the
best
interests
of
your
client
that
these
letters
should
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
earl
then
you
would
indeed
be
foolish
to
pay
so
large
sum
of
money
to
regain
them
he
rose
and
seized
his
astrachan
coat
holmes
was
grey
with
anger
and
mortification
wait
little
he
said
you
go
too
fast
we
would
certainly
make
every
effort
to
avoid
scandal
in
so
delicate
matter
milverton
relapsed
into
his
chair
was
sure
that
you
would
see
it
in
that
light
he
purred
at
the
same
time
holmes
continued
lady
eva
is
not
wealthy
woman
assure
you
that
two
thousand
pounds
would
be
drain
upon
her
resources
and
that
the
sum
you
name
is
utterly
beyond
her
power
beg
therefore
that
you
will
moderate
your
demands
and
that
you
will
return
the
letters
at
the
price
indicate
which
is
assure
you
the
highest
that
you
can
get
milverton
smile
broadened
and
his
eyes
twinkled
humorously
am
aware
that
what
you
say
is
true
about
the
lady
resources
said
he
at
the
same
time
you
must
admit
that
the
occasion
of
lady
marriage
is
very
suitable
time
for
her
friends
and
relatives
to
make
some
little
effort
upon
her
behalf
they
may
hesitate
as
to
an
acceptable
wedding
present
let
me
assure
them
that
this
little
bundle
of
letters
would
give
more
joy
than
all
the
candelabra
and
butter
dishes
in
london
it
is
impossible
said
holmes
dear
me
dear
me
how
unfortunate
cried
milverton
taking
out
bulky
pocket
book
cannot
help
thinking
that
ladies
are
ill
advised
in
not
making
an
effort
look
at
this
he
held
up
little
note
with
coat
of
arms
upon
the
envelope
that
belongs
to
well
perhaps
it
is
hardly
fair
to
tell
the
name
until
to
morrow
morning
but
at
that
time
it
will
be
in
the
hands
of
the
lady
husband
and
all
because
she
will
not
find
beggarly
sum
which
she
could
get
by
turning
her
diamonds
into
paste
it
is
such
pity
now
you
remember
the
sudden
end
of
the
engagement
between
the
honourable
miss
miles
and
colonel
dorking
only
two
days
before
the
wedding
there
was
paragraph
in
the
morning
post
to
say
that
it
was
all
off
and
why
it
is
almost
incredible
but
the
absurd
sum
of
twelve
hundred
pounds
would
have
settled
the
whole
question
is
it
not
pitiful
and
here
find
you
man
of
sense
boggling
about
terms
when
your
client
future
and
honour
are
at
stake
you
surprise
me
mr
holmes
what
say
is
true
holmes
answered
the
money
cannot
be
found
surely
it
is
better
for
you
to
take
the
substantial
sum
which
offer
than
to
ruin
this
woman
career
which
can
profit
you
in
no
way
there
you
make
mistake
mr
holmes
an
exposure
would
profit
me
indirectly
to
considerable
extent
have
eight
or
ten
similar
cases
maturing
if
it
was
circulated
among
them
that
had
made
severe
example
of
the
lady
eva
should
find
all
of
them
much
more
open
to
reason
you
see
my
point
holmes
sprang
from
his
chair
get
behind
him
watson
don
let
him
out
now
sir
let
us
see
the
contents
of
that
note
book
milverton
had
glided
as
quick
as
rat
to
the
side
of
the
room
and
stood
with
his
back
against
the
wall
mr
holmes
mr
holmes
he
said
turning
the
front
of
his
coat
and
exhibiting
the
butt
of
large
revolver
which
projected
from
the
inside
pocket
have
been
expecting
you
to
do
something
original
this
has
been
done
so
often
and
what
good
has
ever
come
from
it
assure
you
that
am
armed
to
the
teeth
and
am
perfectly
prepared
to
use
my
weapons
knowing
that
the
law
will
support
me
besides
your
supposition
that
would
bring
the
letters
here
in
note
book
is
entirely
mistaken
would
do
nothing
so
foolish
and
now
gentlemen
have
one
or
two
little
interviews
this
evening
and
it
is
long
drive
to
hampstead
he
stepped
forward
took
up
his
coat
laid
his
hand
on
his
revolver
and
turned
to
the
door
picked
up
chair
but
holmes
shook
his
head
and
laid
it
down
again
with
bow
smile
and
twinkle
milverton
was
out
of
the
room
and
few
moments
after
we
heard
the
slam
of
the
carriage
door
and
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
as
he
drove
away
holmes
sat
motionless
by
the
fire
his
hands
buried
deep
in
his
trouser
pockets
his
chin
sunk
upon
his
breast
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
glowing
embers
for
half
an
hour
he
was
silent
and
still
then
with
the
gesture
of
man
who
has
taken
his
decision
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
passed
into
his
bedroom
little
later
rakish
young
workman
with
goatee
beard
and
swagger
lit
his
clay
pipe
at
the
lamp
before
descending
into
the
street
ll
be
back
some
time
watson
said
he
and
vanished
into
the
night
understood
that
he
had
opened
his
campaign
against
charles
augustus
milverton
but
little
dreamed
the
strange
shape
which
that
campaign
was
destined
to
take
for
some
days
holmes
came
and
went
at
all
hours
in
this
attire
but
beyond
remark
that
his
time
was
spent
at
hampstead
and
that
it
was
not
wasted
knew
nothing
of
what
he
was
doing
at
last
however
on
wild
tempestuous
evening
when
the
wind
screamed
and
rattled
against
the
windows
he
returned
from
his
last
expedition
and
having
removed
his
disguise
he
sat
before
the
fire
and
laughed
heartily
in
his
silent
inward
fashion
you
would
not
call
me
marrying
man
watson
no
indeed
you
ll
be
interested
to
hear
that
am
engaged
my
dear
fellow
congrat
to
milverton
housemaid
good
heavens
holmes
wanted
information
watson
surely
you
have
gone
too
far
it
was
most
necessary
step
am
plumber
with
rising
business
escott
by
name
have
walked
out
with
her
each
evening
and
have
talked
with
her
good
heavens
those
talks
however
have
got
all
wanted
know
milverton
house
as
know
the
palm
of
my
hand
but
the
girl
holmes
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
can
help
it
my
dear
watson
you
must
play
your
cards
as
best
you
can
when
such
stake
is
on
the
table
however
rejoice
to
say
that
have
hated
rival
who
will
certainly
cut
me
out
the
instant
that
my
back
is
turned
what
splendid
night
it
is
you
like
this
weather
it
suits
my
purpose
watson
mean
to
burgle
milverton
house
to
night
had
catching
of
the
breath
and
my
skin
went
cold
at
the
words
which
were
slowly
uttered
in
tone
of
concentrated
resolution
as
flash
of
lightning
in
the
night
shows
up
in
an
instant
every
detail
of
wide
landscape
so
at
one
glance
seemed
to
see
every
possible
result
of
such
an
action
the
detection
the
capture
the
honoured
career
ending
in
irreparable
failure
and
disgrace
my
friend
himself
lying
at
the
mercy
of
the
odious
milverton
for
heaven
sake
holmes
think
what
you
are
doing
cried
my
dear
fellow
have
given
it
every
consideration
am
never
precipitate
in
my
actions
nor
would
adopt
so
energetic
and
indeed
so
dangerous
course
if
any
other
were
possible
let
us
look
at
the
matter
clearly
and
fairly
suppose
that
you
will
admit
that
the
action
is
morally
justifiable
though
technically
criminal
to
burgle
his
house
is
no
more
than
to
forcibly
take
his
pocket
book
an
action
in
which
you
were
prepared
to
aid
me
turned
it
over
in
my
mind
yes
said
it
is
morally
justifiable
so
long
as
our
object
is
to
take
no
articles
save
those
which
are
used
for
an
illegal
purpose
exactly
since
it
is
morally
justifiable
have
only
to
consider
the
question
of
personal
risk
surely
gentleman
should
not
lay
much
stress
upon
this
when
lady
is
in
most
desperate
need
of
his
help
you
will
be
in
such
false
position
well
that
is
part
of
the
risk
there
is
no
other
possible
way
of
regaining
these
letters
the
unfortunate
lady
has
not
the
money
and
there
are
none
of
her
people
in
whom
she
could
confide
to
morrow
is
the
last
day
of
grace
and
unless
we
can
get
the
letters
to
night
this
villain
will
be
as
good
as
his
word
and
will
bring
about
her
ruin
must
therefore
abandon
my
client
to
her
fate
or
must
play
this
last
card
between
ourselves
watson
it
sporting
duel
between
this
fellow
milverton
and
me
he
had
as
you
saw
the
best
of
the
first
exchanges
but
my
self
respect
and
my
reputation
are
concerned
to
fight
it
to
finish
well
don
like
it
but
suppose
it
must
be
said
when
do
we
start
you
are
not
coming
then
you
are
not
going
said
give
you
my
word
of
honour
and
never
broke
it
in
my
life
that
will
take
cab
straight
to
the
police
station
and
give
you
away
unless
you
let
me
share
this
adventure
with
you

holmes
had
looked
annoyed
but
his
brow
cleared
and
he
clapped
me
on
the
shoulder
well
my
dear
fellow
be
it
so
we
have
shared
the
same
room
for
some
years
and
it
would
be
amusing
if
we
ended
by
sharing
the
same
cell

with

with

theatre
goers
homeward
bound
in
oxford
street
we
picked
up
hansom
and
drove
to
an
address
in
hampstead
here
we
paid
off
our
cab
and
with
our
great
coats
buttoned
up
for
it
was
bitterly
cold
and
the
wind
seemed
to
blow
through
us
we
walked
along
the
edge
of
the
heath
it
business
that
needs
delicate
treatment
said
holmes
these
documents
are
contained
in
safe
in
the
fellow
study
and
the
study
is
the
ante
room
of
his
bed
chamber
on
the
other
hand
like
all
these
stout
little
men
who
do
themselves
well
he
is
plethoric
sleeper
agatha
that
my
fiancee
says
it
is
joke
in
the
servants
hall
that
it
impossible
to
wake
the
master
he
has
secretary
who
is
devoted
to
his
interests
and
never
budges
from
the
study
all
day
that
why
we
are
going
at
night
then
he
has
beast
of
dog
which
roams
the
garden
met
agatha
late
the
last
two
evenings
and
she
locks
the
brute
up
so
as
to
give
me
clear
run
this
is
the
house
this
big
one
in
its
own
grounds
through
the
gate
now
to
the
right
among
the
laurels
we
might
put
on
our
masks
here
think
you
see
there
is
not
glimmer
of
light
in
any
of
the
windows
and
everything
is
working
splendidly
with
our
black
silk
face
coverings
which
turned
us
into
two
of
the
most
truculent
figures
in
london
we
stole
up
to
the
silent
gloomy
house
sort
of
tiled
veranda
extended
along
one
side
of
it
lined
by
several
windows
and
two
doors
that
his
bedroom
holmes
whispered
this
door
opens
straight
into
the
study
it
would
suit
us
best
but
it
is
bolted
as
well
as
locked
and
we
should
make
too
much
noise
getting
in
come
round
here
there
greenhouse
which
opens
into
the
drawing
room
the
place
was
locked
but
holmes
removed
circle
of
glass
and
turned
the
key
from
the
inside
an
instant
afterwards
he
had
closed
the
door
behind
us
and
we
had
become
felons
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
the
thick
warm
air
of
the
conservatory
and
the
rich
choking
fragrance
of
exotic
plants
took
us
by
the
throat
he
seized
my
hand
in
the
darkness
and
led
me
swiftly
past
banks
of
shrubs
which
brushed
against
our
faces
holmes
had
remarkable
powers
carefully
cultivated
of
seeing
in
the
dark
still
holding
my
hand
in
one
of
his
he
opened
door
and
was
vaguely
conscious
that
we
had
entered
large
room
in
which
cigar
had
been
smoked
not
long
before
he
felt
his
way
among
the
furniture
opened
another
door
and
closed
it
behind
us
putting
out
my
hand
felt
several
coats
hanging
from
the
wall
and
understood
that
was
in
passage
we
passed
along
it
and
holmes
very
gently
opened
door
upon
the
right
hand
side
something
rushed
out
at
us
and
my
heart
sprang
into
my
mouth
but
could
have
laughed
when
realized
that
it
was
the
cat
fire
was
burning
in
this
new
room
and
again
the
air
was
heavy
with
tobacco
smoke
holmes
entered
on
tiptoe
waited
for
me
to
follow
and
then
very
gently
closed
the
door
we
were
in
milverton
study
and
portiere
at
the
farther
side
showed
the
entrance
to
his
bedroom
it
was
good
fire
and
the
room
was
illuminated
by
it
near
the
door
saw
the
gleam
of
an
electric
switch
but
it
was
unnecessary
even
if
it
had
been
safe
to
turn
it
on
at
one
side
of
the
fireplace
was
heavy
curtain
which
covered
the
bay
window
we
had
seen
from
outside
on
the
other
side
was
the
door
which
communicated
with
the
veranda
desk
stood
in
the
centre
with
turning
chair
of
shining
red
leather
opposite
was
large
bookcase
with
marble
bust
of
athene
on
the
top
in
the
corner
between
the
bookcase
and
the
wall
there
stood
tall
green
safe
the
firelight
flashing
back
from
the
polished
brass
knobs
upon
its
face
holmes
stole
across
and
looked
at
it
then
he
crept
to
the
door
of
the
bedroom
and
stood
with
slanting
head
listening
intently
no
sound
came
from
within
meanwhile
it
had
struck
me
that
it
would
be
wise
to
secure
our
retreat
through
the
outer
door
so
examined
it
to
my
amazement
it
was
neither
locked
nor
bolted
touched
holmes
on
the
arm
and
he
turned
his
masked
face
in
that
direction
saw
him
start
and
he
was
evidently
as
surprised
as
don
like
it
he
whispered
putting
his
lips
to
my
very
ear
can
quite
make
it
out
anyhow
we
have
no
time
to
lose
can
do
anything
yes
stand
by
the
door
if
you
hear
anyone
come
bolt
it
on
the
inside
and
we
can
get
away
as
we
came
if
they
come
the
other
way
we
can
get
through
the
door
if
our
job
is
done
or
hide
behind
these
window
curtains
if
it
is
not
do
you
understand
nodded
and
stood
by
the
door
my
first
feeling
of
fear
had
passed
away
and
thrilled
now
with
keener
zest
than
had
ever
enjoyed
when
we
were
the
defenders
of
the
law
instead
of
its
defiers
the
high
object
of
our
mission
the
consciousness
that
it
was
unselfish
and
chivalrous
the
villainous
character
of
our
opponent
all
added
to
the
sporting
interest
of
the
adventure
far
from
feeling
guilty
rejoiced
and
exulted
in
our
dangers
with
glow
of
admiration
watched
holmes
unrolling
his
case
of
instruments
and
choosing
his
tool
with
the
calm
scientific
accuracy
of
surgeon
who
performs
delicate
operation
knew
that
the
opening
of
safes
was
particular
hobby
with
him
and
understood
the
joy
which
it
gave
him
to
be
confronted
with
this
green
and
gold
monster
the
dragon
which
held
in
its
maw
the
reputations
of
many
fair
ladies
turning
up
the
cuffs
of
his
dress
coat
he
had
placed
his
overcoat
on
chair
holmes
laid
out
two
drills
jemmy
and
several
skeleton
keys
stood
at
the
centre
door
with
my
eyes
glancing
at
each
of
the
others
ready
for
any
emergency
though
indeed
my
plans
were
somewhat
vague
as
to
what
should
do
if
we
were
interrupted
for
half
an
hour
holmes
worked
with
concentrated
energy
laying
down
one
tool
picking
up
another
handling
each
with
the
strength
and
delicacy
of
the
trained
mechanic
finally
heard
click
the
broad
green
door
swung
open
and
inside
had
glimpse
of
number
of
paper
packets
each
tied
sealed
and
inscribed
holmes
picked
one
out
but
it
was
hard
to
read
by
the
flickering
fire
and
he
drew
out
his
little
dark
lantern
for
it
was
too
dangerous
with
milverton
in
the
next
room
to
switch
on
the
electric
light
suddenly
saw
him
halt
listen
intently
and
then
in
an
instant
he
had
swung
the
door
of
the
safe
to
picked
up
his
coat
stuffed
his
tools
into
the
pockets
and
darted
behind
the
window
curtain
motioning
me
to
do
the
same
it
was
only
when
had
joined
him
there
that
heard
what
had
alarmed
his
quicker
senses
there
was
noise
somewhere
within
the
house
door
slammed
in
the
distance
then
confused
dull
murmur
broke
itself
into
the
measured
thud
of
heavy
footsteps
rapidly
approaching
they
were
in
the
passage
outside
the
room
they
paused
at
the
door
the
door
opened
there
was
sharp
snick
as
the
electric
light
was
turned
on
the
door
closed
once
more
and
the
pungent
reek
of
strong
cigar
was
borne
to
our
nostrils
then
the
footsteps
continued
backwards
and
forwards
backwards
and
forwards
within
few
yards
of
us
finally
there
was
creak
from
chair
and
the
footsteps
ceased
then
key
clicked
in
lock
and
heard
the
rustle
of
papers
so
far
had
not
dared
to
look
out
but
now
gently
parted
the
division
of
the
curtains
in
front
of
me
and
peeped
through
from
the
pressure
of
holmes
shoulder
against
mine
knew
that
he
was
sharing
my
observations
right
in
front
of
us
and
almost
within
our
reach
was
the
broad
rounded
back
of
milverton
it
was
evident
that
we
had
entirely
miscalculated
his
movements
that
he
had
never
been
to
his
bedroom
but
that
he
had
been
sitting
up
in
some
smoking
or
billiard
room
in
the
farther
wing
of
the
house
the
windows
of
which
we
had
not
seen
his
broad
grizzled
head
with
its
shining
patch
of
baldness
was
in
the
immediate
foreground
of
our
vision
he
was
leaning
far
back
in
the
red
leather
chair
his
legs
outstretched
long
black
cigar
projecting
at
an
angle
from
his
mouth
he
wore
semi
military
smoking
jacket
claret
coloured
with
black
velvet
collar
in
his
hand
he
held
long
legal
document
which
he
was
reading
in
an
indolent
fashion
blowing
rings
of
tobacco
smoke
from
his
lips
as
he
did
so
there
was
no
promise
of
speedy
departure
in
his
composed
bearing
and
his
comfortable
attitude

felt
holmes
hand
steal
into
mine
and
give
me
reassuring
shake
as
if
to
say
that
the
situation
was
within
his
powers
and
that
he
was
easy
in
his
mind
was
not
sure
whether
he
had
seen
what
was
only
too
obvious
from
my
position
that
the
door
of
the
safe
was
imperfectly
closed
and
that
milverton
might
at
any
moment
observe
it
in
my
own
mind
had
determined
that
if
were
sure
from
the
rigidity
of
his
gaze
that
it
had
caught
his
eye
would
at
once
spring
out
throw
my
great
coat
over
his
head
pinion
him
and
leave
the
rest
to
holmes
but
milverton
never
looked
up
he
was
languidly
interested
by
the
papers
in
his
hand
and
page
after
page
was
turned
as
he
followed
the
argument
of
the
lawyer
at
least
thought
when
he
has
finished
the
document
and
the
cigar
he
will
go
to
his
room
but
before
he
had
reached
the
end
of
either
there
came
remarkable
development
which
turned
our
thoughts
into
quite
another
channel
several
times
had
observed
that
milverton
looked
at
his
watch
and
once
he
had
risen
and
sat
down
again
with
gesture
of
impatience
the
idea
however
that
he
might
have
an
appointment
at
so
strange
an
hour
never
occurred
to
me
until
faint
sound
reached
my
ears
from
the
veranda
outside
milverton
dropped
his
papers
and
sat
rigid
in
his
chair
the
sound
was
repeated
and
then
there
came
gentle
tap
at
the
door
milverton
rose
and
opened
it
well
said
he
curtly
you
are
nearly
half
an
hour
late
so
this
was
the
explanation
of
the
unlocked
door
and
of
the
nocturnal
vigil
of
milverton
there
was
the
gentle
rustle
of
woman
dress
had
closed
the
slit
between
the
curtains
as
milverton
face
had
turned
in
our
direction
but
now
ventured
very
carefully
to
open
it
once
more
he
had
resumed
his
seat
the
cigar
still
projecting
at
an
insolent
angle
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
in
front
of
him
in
the
full
glare
of
the
electric
light
there
stood
tall
slim
dark
woman
veil
over
her
face
mantle
drawn
round
her
chin
her
breath
came
quick
and
fast
and
every
inch
of
the
lithe
figure
was
quivering
with
strong
emotion
well
said
milverton
you
ve
made
me
lose
good
night
rest
my
dear
hope
you
ll
prove
worth
it
you
couldn
come
any
other
time
eh
the
woman
shook
her
head
well
if
you
couldn
you
couldn
if
the
countess
is
hard
mistress
you
have
your
chance
to
get
level
with
her
now
bless
the
girl
what
are
you
shivering
about
that
right
pull
yourself
together
now
let
us
get
down
to
business
he
took
note
from
the
drawer
of
his
desk
you
say
that
you
have
five
letters
which
compromise
the
countess
albert
you
want
to
sell
them
want
to
buy
them
so
far
so
good
it
only
remains
to
fix
price
should
want
to
inspect
the
letters
of
course
if
they
are
really
good
specimens
great
heavens
is
it
you
the
woman
without
word
had
raised
her
veil
and
dropped
the
mantle
from
her
chin
it
was
dark
handsome
clear
cut
face
which
confronted
milverton
face
with
curved
nose
strong
dark
eyebrows
shading
hard
glittering
eyes
and
straight
thin
lipped
mouth
set
in
dangerous
smile
it
is
she
said
the
woman
whose
life
you
have
ruined
milverton
laughed
but
fear
vibrated
in
his
voice
you
were
so
very
obstinate
said
he
why
did
you
drive
me
to
such
extremities
assure
you
wouldn
hurt
fly
of
my
own
accord
but
every
man
has
his
business
and
what
was
to
do
put
the
price
well
within
your
means
you
would
not
pay
so
you
sent
the
letters
to
my
husband
and
he
the
noblest
gentleman
that
ever
lived
man
whose
boots
was
never
worthy
to
lace
he
broke
his
gallant
heart
and
died
you
remember
that
last
night
when
came
through
that
door
begged
and
prayed
you
for
mercy
and
you
laughed
in
my
face
as
you
are
trying
to
laugh
now
only
your
coward
heart
cannot
keep
your
lips
from
twitching
yes
you
never
thought
to
see
me
here
again
but
it
was
that
night
which
taught
me
how
could
meet
you
face
to
face
and
alone
well
charles
milverton
what
have
you
to
say
don
imagine
that
you
can
bully
me
said
he
rising
to
his
feet
have
only
to
raise
my
voice
and
could
call
my
servants
and
have
you
arrested
but
will
make
allowance
for
your
natural
anger
leave
the
room
at
once
as
you
came
and
will
say
no
more
the
woman
stood
with
her
hand
buried
in
her
bosom
and
the
same
deadly
smile
on
her
thin
lips
you
will
ruin
no
more
lives
as
you
ruined
mine
you
will
wring
no
more
hearts
as
you
wrung
mine
will
free
the
world
of
poisonous
thing
take
that
you
hound
and
that
and
that
and
that
she
had
drawn
little
gleaming
revolver
and
emptied
barrel
after
barrel
into
milverton
body
the
muzzle
within
two
feet
of
his
shirt
front
he
shrank
away
and
then
fell
forward
upon
the
table
coughing
furiously
and
clawing
among
the
papers
then
he
staggered
to
his
feet
received
another
shot
and
rolled
upon
the
floor
you
ve
done
me
he
cried
and
lay
still
the
woman
looked
at
him
intently
and
ground
her
heel
into
his
upturned
face
she
looked
again
but
there
was
no
sound
or
movement
heard
sharp
rustle
the
night
air
blew
into
the
heated
room
and
the
avenger
was
gone
no
interference
upon
our
part
could
have
saved
the
man
from
his
fate
but
as
the
woman
poured
bullet
after
bullet
into
milverton
shrinking
body
was
about
to
spring
out
when
felt
holmes
cold
strong
grasp
upon
my
wrist
understood
the
whole
argument
of
that
firm
restraining
grip
that
it
was
no
affair
of
ours
that
justice
had
overtaken
villain
that
we
had
our
own
duties
and
our
own
objects
which
were
not
to
be
lost
sight
of
but
hardly
had
the
woman
rushed
from
the
room
when
holmes
with
swift
silent
steps
was
over
at
the
other
door
he
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
at
the
same
instant
we
heard
voices
in
the
house
and
the
sound
of
hurrying
feet
the
revolver
shots
had
roused
the
household
with
perfect
coolness
holmes
slipped
across
to
the
safe
filled
his
two
arms
with
bundles
of
letters
and
poured
them
all
into
the
fire
again
and
again
he
did
it
until
the
safe
was
empty
someone
turned
the
handle
and
beat
upon
the
outside
of
the
door
holmes
looked
swiftly
round
the
letter
which
had
been
the
messenger
of
death
for
milverton
lay
all
mottled
with
his
blood
upon
the
table
holmes
tossed
it
in
among
the
blazing
papers
then
he
drew
the
key
from
the
outer
door
passed
through
after
me
and
locked
it
on
the
outside
this
way
watson
said
he
we
can
scale
the
garden
wall
in
this
direction
could
not
have
believed
that
an
alarm
could
have
spread
so
swiftly
looking
back
the
huge
house
was
one
blaze
of
light
the
front
door
was
open
and
figures
were
rushing
down
the
drive
the
whole
garden
was
alive
with
people
and
one
fellow
raised
view
halloa
as
we
emerged
from
the
veranda
and
followed
hard
at
our
heels
holmes
seemed
to
know
the
ground
perfectly
and
he
threaded
his
way
swiftly
among
plantation
of
small
trees
close
at
his
heels
and
our
foremost
pursuer
panting
behind
us
it
was
six
foot
wall
which
barred
our
path
but
he
sprang
to
the
top
and
over
as
did
the
same
felt
the
hand
of
the
man
behind
me
grab
at
my
ankle
but
kicked
myself
free
and
scrambled
over
glass
strewn
coping
fell
upon
my
face
among
some
bushes
but
holmes
had
me
on
my
feet
in
an
instant
and
together
we
dashed
away
across
the
huge
expanse
of
hampstead
heath
we
had
run
two
miles
suppose
before
holmes
at
last
halted
and
listened
intently
all
was
absolute
silence
behind
us
we
had
shaken
off
our
pursuers
and
were
safe
we
had
breakfasted
and
were
smoking
our
morning
pipe
on
the
day
after
the
remarkable
experience
which
have
recorded
when
mr
lestrade
of
scotland
yard
very
solemn
and
impressive
was
ushered
into
our
modest
sitting
room
good
morning
mr
holmes
said
he
good
morning
may
ask
if
you
are
very
busy
just
now
not
too
busy
to
listen
to
you
thought
that
perhaps
if
you
had
nothing
particular
on
hand
you
might
care
to
assist
us
in
most
remarkable
case
which
occurred
only
last
night
at
hampstead
dear
me
said
holmes
what
was
that
murder
most
dramatic
and
remarkable
murder
know
how
keen
you
are
upon
these
things
and
would
take
it
as
great
favour
if
you
would
step
down
to
appledore
towers
and
give
us
the
benefit
of
your
advice
it
is
no
ordinary
crime
we
have
had
our
eyes
upon
this
mr
milverton
for
some
time
and
between
ourselves
he
was
bit
of
villain
he
is
known
to
have
held
papers
which
he
used
for
blackmailing
purposes
these
papers
have
all
been
burned
by
the
murderers
no
article
of
value
was
taken
as
it
is
probable
that
the
criminals
were
men
of
good
position
whose
sole
object
was
to
prevent
social
exposure
criminals
said
holmes
plural
yes
there
were
two
of
them
they
were
as
nearly
as
possible
captured
red
handed
we
have
their
foot
marks
we
have
their
description
it
ten
to
one
that
we
trace
them
the
first
fellow
was
bit
too
active
but
the
second
was
caught
by
the
under
gardener
and
only
got
away
after
struggle
he
was
middle
sized
strongly
built
man
square
jaw
thick
neck
moustache
mask
over
his
eyes

that
rather
vague
said
sherlock
holmes
why
it
might
be
description
of
watson
it
true
said
the
inspector
with
much
amusement
it
might
be
description
of
watson
well
am
afraid
can
help
you
lestrade
said
holmes
the
fact
is
that
knew
this
fellow
milverton
that
considered
him
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
london
and
that
think
there
are
certain
crimes
which
the
law
cannot
touch
and
which
therefore
to
some
extent
justify
private
revenge
no
it
no
use
arguing
have
made
up
my
mind
my
sympathies
are
with
the
criminals
rather
than
with
the
victim
and
will
not
handle
this
case
holmes
had
not
said
one
word
to
me
about
the
tragedy
which
we
had
witnessed
but
observed
all
the
morning
that
he
was
in
his
most
thoughtful
mood
and
he
gave
me
the
impression
from
his
vacant
eyes
and
his
abstracted
manner
of
man
who
is
striving
to
recall
something
to
his
memory
we
were
in
the
middle
of
our
lunch
when
he
suddenly
sprang
to
his
feet
by
jove
watson
ve
got
it
he
cried
take
your
hat
come
with
me
he
hurried
at
his
top
speed
down
baker
street
and
along
oxford
street
until
we
had
almost
reached
regent
circus
here
on
the
left
hand
there
stands
shop
window
filled
with
photographs
of
the
celebrities
and
beauties
of
the
day
holmes
eyes
fixed
themselves
upon
one
of
them
and
following
his
gaze
saw
the
picture
of
regal
and
stately
lady
in
court
dress
with
high
diamond
tiara
upon
her
noble
head
looked
at
that
delicately
curved
nose
at
the
marked
eyebrows
at
the
straight
mouth
and
the
strong
little
chin
beneath
it
then
caught
my
breath
as
read
the
time
honoured
title
of
the
great
nobleman
and
statesman
whose
wife
she
had
been
my
eyes
met
those
of
holmes
and
he
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
as
we
turned
away
from
the
window
viii
the
adventure
of
the
six
napoleons
it
was
no
very
unusual
thing
for
mr
lestrade
of
scotland
yard
to
look
in
upon
us
of
an
evening
and
his
visits
were
welcome
to
sherlock
holmes
for
they
enabled
him
to
keep
in
touch
with
all
that
was
going
on
at
the
police
head
quarters
in
return
for
the
news
which
lestrade
would
bring
holmes
was
always
ready
to
listen
with
attention
to
the
details
of
any
case
upon
which
the
detective
was
engaged
and
was
able
occasionally
without
any
active
interference
to
give
some
hint
or
suggestion
drawn
from
his
own
vast
knowledge
and
experience
on
this
particular
evening
lestrade
had
spoken
of
the
weather
and
the
newspapers
then
he
had
fallen
silent
puffing
thoughtfully
at
his
cigar
holmes
looked
keenly
at
him
anything
remarkable
on
hand
he
asked
oh
no
mr
holmes
nothing
very
particular
then
tell
me
about
it
lestrade
laughed
well
mr
holmes
there
is
no
use
denying
that
there
is
something
on
my
mind
and
yet
it
is
such
an
absurd
business
that
hesitated
to
bother
you
about
it
on
the
other
hand
although
it
is
trivial
it
is
undoubtedly
queer
and
know
that
you
have
taste
for
all
that
is
out
of
the
common
but
in
my
opinion
it
comes
more
in
dr
watson
line
than
ours
disease
said
madness
anyhow
and
queer
madness
too
you
wouldn
think
there
was
anyone
living
at
this
time
of
day
who
had
such
hatred
of
napoleon
the
first
that
he
would
break
any
image
of
him
that
he
could
see
holmes
sank
back
in
his
chair
that
no
business
of
mine
said
he
exactly
that
what
said
but
then
when
the
man
commits
burglary
in
order
to
break
images
which
are
not
his
own
that
brings
it
away
from
the
doctor
and
on
to
the
policeman
holmes
sat
up
again
burglary
this
is
more
interesting
let
me
hear
the
details
lestrade
took
out
his
official
note
book
and
refreshed
his
memory
from
its
pages
the
first
case
reported
was
four
days
ago
said
he
it
was
at
the
shop
of
morse
hudson
who
has
place
for
the
sale
of
pictures
and
statues
in
the
kennington
road
the
assistant
had
left
the
front
shop
for
an
instant
when
he
heard
crash
and
hurrying
in
he
found
plaster
bust
of
napoleon
which
stood
with
several
other
works
of
art
upon
the
counter
lying
shivered
into
fragments
he
rushed
out
into
the
road
but
although
several
passers
by
declared
that
they
had
noticed
man
run
out
of
the
shop
he
could
neither
see
anyone
nor
could
he
find
any
means
of
identifying
the
rascal
it
seemed
to
be
one
of
those
senseless
acts
of
hooliganism
which
occur
from
time
to
time
and
it
was
reported
to
the
constable
on
the
beat
as
such
the
plaster
cast
was
not
worth
more
than
few
shillings
and
the
whole
affair
appeared
to
be
too
childish
for
any
particular
investigation
the
second
case
however
was
more
serious
and
also
more
singular
it
occurred
only
last
night
in
kennington
road
and
within
few
hundred
yards
of
morse
hudson
shop
there
lives
well
known
medical
practitioner
named
dr
barnicot
who
has
one
of
the
largest
practices
upon
the
south
side
of
the
thames
his
residence
and
principal
consulting
room
is
at
kennington
road
but
he
has
branch
surgery
and
dispensary
at
lower
brixton
road
two
miles
away
this
dr
barnicot
is
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
napoleon
and
his
house
is
full
of
books
pictures
and
relics
of
the
french
emperor
some
little
time
ago
he
purchased
from
morse
hudson
two
duplicate
plaster
casts
of
the
famous
head
of
napoleon
by
the
french
sculptor
devine
one
of
these
he
placed
in
his
hall
in
the
house
at
kennington
road
and
the
other
on
the
mantelpiece
of
the
surgery
at
lower
brixton
well
when
dr
barnicot
came
down
this
morning
he
was
astonished
to
find
that
his
house
had
been
burgled
during
the
night
but
that
nothing
had
been
taken
save
the
plaster
head
from
the
hall
it
had
been
carried
out
and
had
been
dashed
savagely
against
the
garden
wall
under
which
its
splintered
fragments
were
discovered
holmes
rubbed
his
hands
this
is
certainly
very
novel
said
he
thought
it
would
please
you
but
have
not
got
to
the
end
yet
dr
barnicot
was
due
at
his
surgery
at
twelve
clock
and
you
can
imagine
his
amazement
when
on
arriving
there
he
found
that
the
window
had
been
opened
in
the
night
and
that
the
broken
pieces
of
his
second
bust
were
strewn
all
over
the
room
it
had
been
smashed
to
atoms
where
it
stood
in
neither
case
were
there
any
signs
which
could
give
us
clue
as
to
the
criminal
or
lunatic
who
had
done
the
mischief
now
mr
holmes
you
have
got
the
facts
they
are
singular
not
to
say
grotesque
said
holmes
may
ask
whether
the
two
busts
smashed
in
dr
barnicot
rooms
were
the
exact
duplicates
of
the
one
which
was
destroyed
in
morse
hudson
shop
they
were
taken
from
the
same
mould
such
fact
must
tell
against
the
theory
that
the
man
who
breaks
them
is
influenced
by
any
general
hatred
of
napoleon
considering
how
many
hundreds
of
statues
of
the
great
emperor
must
exist
in
london
it
is
too
much
to
suppose
such
coincidence
as
that
promiscuous
iconoclast
should
chance
to
begin
upon
three
specimens
of
the
same
bust
well
thought
as
you
do
said
lestrade
on
the
other
hand
this
morse
hudson
is
the
purveyor
of
busts
in
that
part
of
london
and
these
three
were
the
only
ones
which
had
been
in
his
shop
for
years
so
although
as
you
say
there
are
many
hundreds
of
statues
in
london
it
is
very
probable
that
these
three
were
the
only
ones
in
that
district
therefore
local
fanatic
would
begin
with
them
what
do
you
think
dr
watson
there
are
no
limits
to
the
possibilities
of
monomania
answered
there
is
the
condition
which
the
modern
french
psychologists
have
called
the
idee
fixe
which
may
be
trifling
in
character
and
accompanied
by
complete
sanity
in
every
other
way
man
who
had
read
deeply
about
napoleon
or
who
had
possibly
received
some
hereditary
family
injury
through
the
great
war
might
conceivably
form
such
an
idee
fixe
and
under
its
influence
be
capable
of
any
fantastic
outrage
that
won
do
my
dear
watson
said
holmes
shaking
his
head
for
no
amount
of
idee
fixe
would
enable
your
interesting
monomaniac
to
find
out
where
these
busts
were
situated
well
how
do
you
explain
it
don
attempt
to
do
so
would
only
observe
that
there
is
certain
method
in
the
gentleman
eccentric
proceedings
for
example
in
dr
barnicot
hall
where
sound
might
arouse
the
family
the
bust
was
taken
outside
before
being
broken
whereas
in
the
surgery
where
there
was
less
danger
of
an
alarm
it
was
smashed
where
it
stood
the
affair
seems
absurdly
trifling
and
yet
dare
call
nothing
trivial
when
reflect
that
some
of
my
most
classic
cases
have
had
the
least
promising
commencement
you
will
remember
watson
how
the
dreadful
business
of
the
abernetty
family
was
first
brought
to
my
notice
by
the
depth
which
the
parsley
had
sunk
into
the
butter
upon
hot
day
can
afford
therefore
to
smile
at
your
three
broken
busts
lestrade
and
shall
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
if
you
will
let
me
hear
of
any
fresh
developments
of
so
singular
chain
of

the
development
for
which
my
friend
had
asked
came
in
quicker
and
an
infinitely
more
tragic
form
than
he
could
have
imagined
was
still
dressing
in
my
bedroom
next
morning
when
there
was
tap
at
the
door
and
holmes
entered
telegram
in
his
hand
he
read
it
aloud
come
instantly
131
pitt
street
kensington
lestrade
what
is
it
then
asked
don
know
may
be
anything
but
suspect
it
is
the
sequel
of
the
story
of
the
statues
in
that
case
our
friend
the
image
breaker
has
begun
operations
in
another
quarter
of
london
there
coffee
on
the
table
watson
and
have
cab
at
the
door
in
half
an
hour
we
had
reached
pitt
street
quiet
little
backwater
just
beside
one
of
the
briskest
currents
of
london
life
no
131
was
one
of
row
all
flat
chested
respectable
and
most
unromantic
dwellings
as
we
drove
up
we
found
the
railings
in
front
of
the
house
lined
by
curious
crowd
holmes
whistled
by
george
it
attempted
murder
at
the
least
nothing
less
will
hold
the
london
message
boy
there
deed
of
violence
indicated
in
that
fellow
round
shoulders
and
outstretched
neck
what
this
watson
the
top
steps
swilled
down
and
the
other
ones
dry
footsteps
enough
anyhow
well
there
lestrade
at
the
front
window
and
we
shall
soon
know
all
about
it
the
official
received
us
with
very
grave
face
and
showed
us
into
sitting
room
where
an
exceedingly
unkempt
and
agitated
elderly
man
clad
in
flannel
dressing
gown
was
pacing
up
and
down
he
was
introduced
to
us
as
the
owner
of
the
house
mr
horace
harker
of
the
central
press
syndicate
it
the
napoleon
bust
business
again
said
lestrade
you
seemed
interested
last
night
mr
holmes
so
thought
perhaps
you
would
be
glad
to
be
present
now
that
the
affair
has
taken
very
much
graver
turn
what
has
it
turned
to
then
to
murder
mr
harker
will
you
tell
these
gentlemen
exactly
what
has
occurred
the
man
in
the
dressing
gown
turned
upon
us
with
most
melancholy
face
it
an
extraordinary
thing
said
he
that
all
my
life
have
been
collecting
other
people
news
and
now
that
real
piece
of
news
has
come
my
own
way
am
so
confused
and
bothered
that
can
put
two
words
together
if
had
come
in
here
as
journalist
should
have
interviewed
myself
and
had
two
columns
in
every
evening
paper
as
it
is
am
giving
away
valuable
copy
by
telling
my
story
over
and
over
to
string
of
different
people
and
can
make
no
use
of
it
myself
however
ve
heard
your
name
mr
sherlock
holmes
and
if
you
ll
only
explain
this
queer
business
shall
be
paid
for
my
trouble
in
telling
you
the
story
holmes
sat
down
and
listened
it
all
seems
to
centre
round
that
bust
of
napoleon
which
bought
for
this
very
room
about
four
months
ago
picked
it
up
cheap
from
harding
brothers
two
doors
from
the
high
street
station
great
deal
of
my
journalistic
work
is
done
at
night
and
often
write
until
the
early
morning
so
it
was
to
day
was
sitting
in
my
den
which
is
at
the
back
of
the
top
of
the
house
about
three
clock
when
was
convinced
that
heard
some
sounds
downstairs
listened
but
they
were
not
repeated
and
concluded
that
they
came
from
outside
then
suddenly
about
five
minutes
later
there
came
most
horrible
yell
the
most
dreadful
sound
mr
holmes
that
ever
heard
it
will
ring
in
my
ears
as
long
as
live
sat
frozen
with
horror
for
minute
or
two
then
seized
the
poker
and
went
downstairs
when
entered
this
room
found
the
window
wide
open
and
at
once
observed
that
the
bust
was
gone
from
the
mantelpiece
why
any
burglar
should
take
such
thing
passes
my
understanding
for
it
was
only
plaster
cast
and
of
no
real
value
whatever
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
anyone
going
out
through
that
open
window
could
reach
the
front
doorstep
by
taking
long
stride
this
was
clearly
what
the
burglar
had
done
so
went
round
and
opened
the
door
stepping
out
into
the
dark
nearly
fell
over
dead
man
who
was
lying
there
ran
back
for
light
and
there
was
the
poor
fellow
great
gash
in
his
throat
and
the
whole
place
swimming
in
blood
he
lay
on
his
back
his
knees
drawn
up
and
his
mouth
horribly
open
shall
see
him
in
my
dreams
had
just
time
to
blow
on
my
police
whistle
and
then
must
have
fainted
for
knew
nothing
more
until
found
the
policeman
standing
over
me
in
the
hall
well
who
was
the
murdered
man
asked
holmes
there
nothing
to
show
who
he
was
said
lestrade
you
shall
see
the
body
at
the
mortuary
but
we
have
made
nothing
of
it
up
to
now
he
is
tall
man
sunburned
very
powerful
not
more
than
thirty
he
is
poorly
dressed
and
yet
does
not
appear
to
be
labourer
horn
handled
clasp
knife
was
lying
in
pool
of
blood
beside
him
whether
it
was
the
weapon
which
did
the
deed
or
whether
it
belonged
to
the
dead
man
do
not
know
there
was
no
name
on
his
clothing
and
nothing
in
his
pockets
save
an
apple
some
string
shilling
map
of
london
and
photograph
here
it
is
it
was
evidently
taken
by
snap
shot
from
small
camera
it
represented
an
alert
sharp
featured
simian
man
with
thick
eyebrows
and
very
peculiar
projection
of
the
lower
part
of
the
face
like
the
muzzle
of
baboon
and
what
became
of
the
bust
asked
holmes
after
careful
study
of
this
picture
we
had
news
of
it
just
before
you
came
it
has
been
found
in
the
front
garden
of
an
empty
house
in
campden
house
road
it
was
broken
into
fragments
am
going
round
now
to
see
it
will
you
come
certainly
must
just
take
one
look
round
he
examined
the
carpet
and
the
window
the
fellow
had
either
very
long
legs
or
was
most
active
man
said
he
with
an
area
beneath
it
was
no
mean
feat
to
reach
that
window
ledge
and
open
that
window
getting
back
was
comparatively
simple
are
you
coming
with
us
to
see
the
remains
of
your
bust
mr
harker
the
disconsolate
journalist
had
seated
himself
at
writing
table
must
try
and
make
something
of
it
said
he
though
have
no
doubt
that
the
first
editions
of
the
evening
papers
are
out
already
with
full
details
it
like
my
luck
you
remember
when
the
stand
fell
at
doncaster
well
was
the
only
journalist
in
the
stand
and
my
journal
the
only
one
that
had
no
account
of
it
for
was
too
shaken
to
write
it
and
now
ll
be
too
late
with
murder
done
on
my
own
doorstep
as
we
left
the
room
we
heard
his
pen
travelling
shrilly
over
the
foolscap
the
spot
where
the
fragments
of
the
bust
had
been
found
was
only
few
hundred
yards
away
for
the
first
time
our
eyes
rested
upon
this
presentment
of
the
great
emperor
which
seemed
to
raise
such
frantic
and
destructive
hatred
in
the
mind
of
the
unknown
it
lay
scattered
in
splintered
shards
upon
the
grass
holmes
picked
up
several
of
them
and
examined
them
carefully
was
convinced
from
his
intent
face
and
his
purposeful
manner
that
at
last
he
was
upon
clue
well
asked
lestrade
holmes
shrugged
his
shoulders
we
have
long
way
to
go
yet
said
he
and
yet
and
yet
well
we
have
some
suggestive
facts
to
act
upon
the
possession
of
this
trifling
bust
was
worth
more
in
the
eyes
of
this
strange
criminal
than
human
life
that
is
one
point
then
there
is
the
singular
fact
that
he
did
not
break
it
in
the
house
or
immediately
outside
the
house
if
to
break
it
was
his
sole
object
he
was
rattled
and
bustled
by
meeting
this
other
fellow
he
hardly
knew
what
he
was
doing
well
that
likely
enough
but
wish
to
call
your
attention
very
particularly
to
the
position
of
this
house
in
the
garden
of
which
the
bust
was
destroyed
lestrade
looked
about
him
it
was
an
empty
house
and
so
he
knew
that
he
would
not
be
disturbed
in
the
garden
yes
but
there
is
another
empty
house
farther
up
the
street
which
he
must
have
passed
before
he
came
to
this
one
why
did
he
not
break
it
there
since
it
is
evident
that
every
yard
that
he
carried
it
increased
the
risk
of
someone
meeting
him
give
it
up
said
lestrade
holmes
pointed
to
the
street
lamp
above
our
heads
he
could
see
what
he
was
doing
here
and
he
could
not
there
that
was
his
reason
by
jove
that
true
said
the
detective
now
that
come
to
think
of
it
dr
barnicot
bust
was
broken
not
far
from
his
red
lamp
well
mr
holmes
what
are
we
to
do
with
that
fact
to
remember
it
to
docket
it
we
may
come
on
something
later
which
will
bear
upon
it
what
steps
do
you
propose
to
take
now
lestrade
the
most
practical
way
of
getting
at
it
in
my
opinion
is
to
identify
the
dead
man
there
should
be
no
difficulty
about
that
when
we
have
found
who
he
is
and
who
his
associates
are
we
should
have
good
start
in
learning
what
he
was
doing
in
pitt
street
last
night
and
who
it
was
who
met
him
and
killed
him
on
the
doorstep
of
mr
horace
harker
don
you
think
so
no
doubt
and
yet
it
is
not
quite
the
way
in
which
should
approach
the
case

what
would
you
do
then
oh
you
must
not
let
me
influence
you
in
any
way
suggest
that
you
go
on
your
line
and
on
mine
we
can
compare
notes
afterwards
and
each
will
supplement
the
other
very
good
said
lestrade
if
you
are
going
back
to
pitt
street
you
might
see
mr
horace
harker
tell
him
from
me
that
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
and
that
it
is
certain
that
dangerous
homicidal
lunatic
with
napoleonic
delusions
was
in
his
house
last
night
it
will
be
useful
for
his
article
lestrade
stared
you
don
seriously
believe
that
holmes
smiled
don
well
perhaps
don
but
am
sure
that
it
will
interest
mr
horace
harker
and
the
subscribers
of
the
central
press
syndicate
now
watson
think
that
we
shall
find
that
we
have
long
and
rather
complex
day
work
before
us
should
be
glad
lestrade
if
you
could
make
it
convenient
to
meet
us
at
baker
street
at
six
clock
this
evening
until
then
should
like
to
keep
this
photograph
found
in
the
dead
man
pocket
it
is
possible
that
may
have
to
ask
your
company
and
assistance
upon
small
expedition
which
will
have
be
undertaken
to
night
if
my
chain
of
reasoning
should
prove
to
be
correct
until
then
good
bye
and
good
luck
sherlock
holmes
and
walked
together
to
the
high
street
where
he
stopped
at
the
shop
of
harding
brothers
whence
the
bust
had
been
purchased
young
assistant
informed
us
that
mr
harding
would
be
absent
until
after
noon
and
that
he
was
himself
newcomer
who
could
give
us
no
information
holmes
face
showed
his
disappointment
and
annoyance
well
we
can
expect
to
have
it
all
our
own
way
watson
he
said
at
last
we
must
come
back
in
the
afternoon
if
mr
harding
will
not
be
here
until
then
am
as
you
have
no
doubt
surmised
endeavouring
to
trace
these
busts
to
their
source
in
order
to
find
if
there
is
not
something
peculiar
which
may
account
for
their
remarkable
fate
let
us
make
for
mr
morse
hudson
of
the
kennington
road
and
see
if
he
can
throw
any
light
upon
the
problem
drive
of
an
hour
brought
us
to
the
picture
dealer
establishment
he
was
small
stout
man
with
red
face
and
peppery
manner
yes
sir
on
my
very
counter
sir
said
he
what
we
pay
rates
and
taxes
for
don
know
when
any
ruffian
can
come
in
and
break
one
goods
yes
sir
it
was
who
sold
dr
barnicot
his
two
statues
disgraceful
sir
nihilist
plot
that
what
make
it
no
one
but
an
anarchist
would
go
about
breaking
statues
red
republicans
that
what
call
em
who
did
get
the
statues
from
don
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
it
well
if
you
really
want
to
know
got
them
from
gelder
and
co
in
church
street
stepney
they
are
well
known
house
in
the
trade
and
have
been
this
twenty
years
how
many
had
three
two
and
one
are
three
two
of
dr
barnicot
and
one
smashed
in
broad
daylight
on
my
own
counter
do
know
that
photograph
no
don
yes
do
though
why
it
beppo
he
was
kind
of
italian
piece
work
man
who
made
himself
useful
in
the
shop
he
could
carve
bit
and
gild
and
frame
and
do
odd
jobs
the
fellow
left
me
last
week
and
ve
heard
nothing
of
him
since
no
don
know
where
he
came
from
nor
where
he
went
to
have
nothing
against
him
while
he
was
here
he
was
gone
two
days
before
the
bust
was
smashed
well
that
all
we
could
reasonably
expect
to
get
from
morse
hudson
said
holmes
as
we
emerged
from
the
shop
we
have
this
beppo
as
common
factor
both
in
kennington
and
in
kensington
so
that
is
worth
ten
mile
drive
now
watson
let
us
make
for
gelder
and
co
of
stepney
the
source
and
origin
of
busts
shall
be
surprised
if
we
don
get
some
help
down
there
in
rapid
succession
we
passed
through
the
fringe
of
fashionable
london
hotel
london
theatrical
london
literary
london
commercial
london
and
finally
maritime
london
till
we
came
to
riverside
city
of
hundred
thousand
souls
where
the
tenement
houses
swelter
and
reek
with
the
outcasts
of
europe
here
in
broad
thoroughfare
once
the
abode
of
wealthy
city
merchants
we
found
the
sculpture
works
for
which
we
searched
outside
was
considerable
yard
full
of
monumental
masonry
inside
was
large
room
in
which
fifty
workers
were
carving
or
moulding
the
manager
big
blond
german
received
us
civilly
and
gave
clear
answer
to
all
holmes
questions
reference
to
his
books
showed
that
hundreds
of
casts
had
been
taken
from
marble
copy
of
devine
head
of
napoleon
but
that
the
three
which
had
been
sent
to
morse
hudson
year
or
so
before
had
been
half
of
batch
of
six
the
other
three
being
sent
to
harding
brothers
of
kensington
there
was
no
reason
why
those
six
should
be
different
to
any
of
the
other
casts
he
could
suggest
no
possible
cause
why
anyone
should
wish
to
destroy
them
in
fact
he
laughed
at
the
idea
their
wholesale
price
was
six
shillings
but
the
retailer
would
get
twelve
or
more
the
cast
was
taken
in
two
moulds
from
each
side
of
the
face
and
then
these
two
profiles
of
plaster
of
paris
were
joined
together
to
make
the
complete
bust
the
work
was
usually
done
by
italians
in
the
room
we
were
in
when
finished
the
busts
were
put
on
table
in
the
passage
to
dry
and
afterwards
stored
that
was
all
he
could
tell
us
but
the
production
of
the
photograph
had
remarkable
effect
upon
the
manager
his
face
flushed
with
anger
and
his
brows
knotted
over
his
blue
teutonic
eyes
ah
the
rascal
he
cried
yes
indeed
know
him
very
well
this
has
always
been
respectable
establishment
and
the
only
time
that
we
have
ever
had
the
police
in
it
was
over
this
very
fellow
it
was
more
than
year
ago
now
he
knifed
another
italian
in
the
street
and
then
he
came
to
the
works
with
the
police
on
his
heels
and
he
was
taken
here
beppo
was
his
name
his
second
name
never
knew
serve
me
right
for
engaging
man
with
such
face
but
he
was
good
workman
one
of
the
best
what
did
he
get
the
man
lived
and
he
got
off
with
year
have
no
doubt
he
is
out
now
but
he
has
not
dared
to
show
his
nose
here
we
have
cousin
of
his
here
and
dare
say
he
could
tell
you
where
he
is
no
cried
holmes
not
word
to
the
cousin
not
word
beg
you
the
matter
is
very
important
and
the
farther
go
with
it
the
more
important
it
seems
to
grow
when
you
referred
in
your
ledger
to
the
sale
of
those
casts
observed
that
the
date
was
june
3rd
of
last
year
could
you
give
me
the
date
when
beppo
was
arrested
could
tell
you
roughly
by
the
pay
list
the
manager
answered
yes
he
continued
after
some
turning
over
of
pages
he
was
paid
last
on
may
20th
thank
you
said
holmes
don
think
that
need
intrude
upon
your
time
and
patience
any
more
with
last
word
of
caution
that
he
should
say
nothing
as
to
our
researches
we
turned
our
faces
westward
once
more
the
afternoon
was
far
advanced
before
we
were
able
to
snatch
hasty
luncheon
at
restaurant
news
bill
at
the
entrance
announced
kensington
outrage
murder
by
madman
and
the
contents
of
the
paper
showed
that
mr
horace
harker
had
got
his
account
into
print
after
all
two
columns
were
occupied
with
highly
sensational
and
flowery
rendering
of
the
whole
incident
holmes
propped
it
against
the
cruet
stand
and
read
it
while
he
ate
once
or
twice
he
chuckled
this
is
all
right
watson
said
he
listen
to
this
it
is
satisfactory
to
know
that
there
can
be
no
difference
of
opinion
upon
this
case
since
mr
lestrade
one
of
the
most
experienced
members
of
the
official
force
and
mr
sherlock
holmes
the
well
known
consulting
expert
have
each
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
grotesque
series
of
incidents
which
have
ended
in
so
tragic
fashion
arise
from
lunacy
rather
than
from
deliberate
crime
no
explanation
save
mental
aberration
can
cover
the
facts
the
press
watson
is
most
valuable
institution
if
you
only
know
how
to
use
it
and
now
if
you
have
quite
finished
we
will
hark
back
to
kensington
and
see
what
the
manager
of
harding
brothers
has
to
say
to
the
matter
the
founder
of
that
great
emporium
proved
to
be
brisk
crisp
little
person
very
dapper
and
quick
with
clear
head
and
ready
tongue
yes
sir
have
already
read
the
account
in
the
evening
papers
mr
horace
harker
is
customer
of
ours
we
supplied
him
with
the
bust
some
months
ago
we
ordered
three
busts
of
that
sort
from
gelder
and
co
of
stepney
they
are
all
sold
now
to
whom
oh
dare
say
by
consulting
our
sales
book
we
could
very
easily
tell
you
yes
we
have
the
entries
here
one
to
mr
harker
you
see
and
one
to
mr
josiah
brown
of
laburnum
lodge
laburnum
vale
chiswick
and
one
to
mr
sandeford
of
lower
grove
road
reading
no
have
never
seen
this
face
which
you
show
me
in
the
photograph
you
would
hardly
forget
it
would
you
sir
for
ve
seldom
seen
an
uglier
have
we
any
italians
on
the
staff
yes
sir
we
have
several
among
our
workpeople
and
cleaners
dare
say
they
might
get
peep
at
that
sales
book
if
they
wanted
to
there
is
no
particular
reason
for
keeping
watch
upon
that
book
well
it
very
strange
business
and
hope
that
you
ll
let
me
know
if
anything
comes
of
your
inquiries

holmes
had
taken
several
notes
during
mr
harding
evidence
and
could
see
that
he
was
thoroughly
satisfied
by
the
turn
which
affairs
were
taking
he
made
no
remark
however
save
that
unless
we
hurried
we
should
be
late
for
our
appointment
with
lestrade
sure
enough
when
we
reached
baker
street
the
detective
was
already
there
and
we
found
him
pacing
up
and
down
in
fever
of
impatience
his
look
of
importance
showed
that
his
day
work
had
not
been
in
vain
well
he
asked
what
luck
mr
holmes
we
have
had
very
busy
day
and
not
entirely
wasted
one
my
friend
explained
we
have
seen
both
the
retailers
and
also
the
wholesale
manufacturers
can
trace
each
of
the
busts
now
from
the
beginning
the
busts
cried
lestrade
well
you
have
your
own
methods
mr
sherlock
holmes
and
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
word
against
them
but
think
have
done
better
day
work
than
you
have
identified
the
dead
man
you
don
say
so
and
found
cause
for
the
crime
splendid
we
have
an
inspector
who
makes
specialty
of
saffron
hill
and
the
italian
quarter
well
this
dead
man
had
some
catholic
emblem
round
his
neck
and
that
along
with
his
colour
made
me
think
he
was
from
the
south
inspector
hill
knew
him
the
moment
he
caught
sight
of
him
his
name
is
pietro
venucci
from
naples
and
he
is
one
of
the
greatest
cut
throats
in
london
he
is
connected
with
the
mafia
which
as
you
know
is
secret
political
society
enforcing
its
decrees
by
murder
now
you
see
how
the
affair
begins
to
clear
up
the
other
fellow
is
probably
an
italian
also
and
member
of
the
mafia
he
has
broken
the
rules
in
some
fashion
pietro
is
set
upon
his
track
probably
the
photograph
we
found
in
his
pocket
is
the
man
himself
so
that
he
may
not
knife
the
wrong
person
he
dogs
the
fellow
he
sees
him
enter
house
he
waits
outside
for
him
and
in
the
scuffle
he
receives
his
own
death
wound
how
is
that
mr
sherlock
holmes
clapped
his
hands
approvingly
excellent
lestrade
excellent
he
cried
but
didn
quite
follow
your
explanation
of
the
destruction
of
the
busts
the
busts
you
never
can
get
those
busts
out
of
your
head
after
all
that
is
nothing
petty
larceny
six
months
at
the
most
it
is
the
murder
that
we
are
really
investigating
and
tell
you
that
am
gathering
all
the
threads
into
my
hands
and
the
next
stage
is
very
simple
one
shall
go
down
with
hill
to
the
italian
quarter
find
the
man
whose
photograph
we
have
got
and
arrest
him
on
the
charge
of
murder
will
you
come
with
us
think
not
fancy
we
can
attain
our
end
in
simpler
way
can
say
for
certain
because
it
all
depends
well
it
all
depends
upon
factor
which
is
completely
outside
our
control
but
have
great
hopes
in
fact
the
betting
is
exactly
two
to
one
that
if
you
will
come
with
us
to
night
shall
be
able
to
help
you
to
lay
him
by
the
heels
in
the
italian
quarter
no
fancy
chiswick
is
an
address
which
is
more
likely
to
find
him
if
you
will
come
with
me
to
chiswick
to
night
lestrade
ll
promise
to
go
to
the
italian
quarter
with
you
to
morrow
and
no
harm
will
be
done
by
the
delay
and
now
think
that
few
hours
sleep
would
do
us
all
good
for
do
not
propose
to
leave
before
eleven
clock
and
it
is
unlikely
that
we
shall
be
back
before
morning
you
ll
dine
with
us
lestrade
and
then
you
are
welcome
to
the
sofa
until
it
is
time
for
us
to
start
in
the
meantime
watson
should
be
glad
if
you
would
ring
for
an
express
messenger
for
have
letter
to
send
and
it
is
important
that
it
should
go
at
once
holmes
spent
the
evening
in
rummaging
among
the
files
of
the
old
daily
papers
with
which
one
of
our
lumber
rooms
was
packed
when
at
last
he
descended
it
was
with
triumph
in
his
eyes
but
he
said
nothing
to
either
of
us
as
to
the
result
of
his
researches
for
my
own
part
had
followed
step
by
step
the
methods
by
which
he
had
traced
the
various
windings
of
this
complex
case
and
though
could
not
yet
perceive
the
goal
which
we
would
reach
understood
clearly
that
holmes
expected
this
grotesque
criminal
to
make
an
attempt
upon
the
two
remaining
busts
one
of
which
remembered
was
at
chiswick
no
doubt
the
object
of
our
journey
was
to
catch
him
in
the
very
act
and
could
not
but
admire
the
cunning
with
which
my
friend
had
inserted
wrong
clue
in
the
evening
paper
so
as
to
give
the
fellow
the
idea
that
he
could
continue
his
scheme
with
impunity
was
not
surprised
when
holmes
suggested
that
should
take
my
revolver
with
me
he
had
himself
picked
up
the
loaded
hunting
crop
which
was
his
favourite
weapon
four
wheeler
was
at
the
door
at
eleven
and
in
it
we
drove
to
spot
at
the
other
side
of
hammersmith
bridge
here
the
cabman
was
directed
to
wait
short
walk
brought
us
to
secluded
road
fringed
with
pleasant
houses
each
standing
in
its
own
grounds
in
the
light
of
street
lamp
we
read
laburnum
villa
upon
the
gate
post
of
one
of
them
the
occupants
had
evidently
retired
to
rest
for
all
was
dark
save
for
fanlight
over
the
hall
door
which
shed
single
blurred
circle
on
to
the
garden
path
the
wooden
fence
which
separated
the
grounds
from
the
road
threw
dense
black
shadow
upon
the
inner
side
and
here
it
was
that
we
crouched
fear
that
you
ll
have
long
wait
holmes
whispered
we
may
thank
our
stars
that
it
is
not
raining
don
think
we
can
even
venture
to
smoke
to
pass
the
time
however
it
two
to
one
chance
that
we
get
something
to
pay
us
for
our
trouble
it
proved
however
that
our
vigil
was
not
to
be
so
long
as
holmes
had
led
us
to
fear
and
it
ended
in
very
sudden
and
singular
fashion
in
an
instant
without
the
least
sound
to
warn
us
of
his
coming
the
garden
gate
swung
open
and
lithe
dark
figure
as
swift
and
active
as
an
ape
rushed
up
the
garden
path
we
saw
it
whisk
past
the
light
thrown
from
over
the
door
and
disappear
against
the
black
shadow
of
the
house
there
was
long
pause
during
which
we
held
our
breath
and
then
very
gentle
creaking
sound
came
to
our
ears
the
window
was
being
opened
the
noise
ceased
and
again
there
was
long
silence
the
fellow
was
making
his
way
into
the
house
we
saw
the
sudden
flash
of
dark
lantern
inside
the
room
what
he
sought
was
evidently
not
there
for
again
we
saw
the
flash
through
another
blind
and
then
through
another
let
us
get
to
the
open
window
we
will
nab
him
as
he
climbs
out
lestrade
whispered
but
before
we
could
move
the
man
had
emerged
again
as
he
came
out
into
the
glimmering
patch
of
light
we
saw
that
he
carried
something
white
under
his
arm
he
looked
stealthily
all
round
him
the
silence
of
the
deserted
street
reassured
him
turning
his
back
upon
us
he
laid
down
his
burden
and
the
next
instant
there
was
the
sound
of
sharp
tap
followed
by
clatter
and
rattle
the
man
was
so
intent
upon
what
he
was
doing
that
he
never
heard
our
steps
as
we
stole
across
the
grass
plot
with
the
bound
of
tiger
holmes
was
on
his
back
and
an
instant
later
lestrade
and
had
him
by
either
wrist
and
the
handcuffs
had
been
fastened
as
we
turned
him
over
saw
hideous
sallow
face
with
writhing
furious
features
glaring
up
at
us
and
knew
that
it
was
indeed
the
man
of
the
photograph
whom
we
had
secured
but
it
was
not
our
prisoner
to
whom
holmes
was
giving
his
attention
squatted
on
the
doorstep
he
was
engaged
in
most
carefully
examining
that
which
the
man
had
brought
from
the
house
it
was
bust
of
napoleon
like
the
one
which
we
had
seen
that
morning
and
it
had
been
broken
into
similar
fragments
carefully
holmes
held
each
separate
shard
to
the
light
but
in
no
way
did
it
differ
from
any
other
shattered
piece
of
plaster
he
had
just
completed
his
examination
when
the
hall
lights
flew
up
the
door
opened
and
the
owner
of
the
house
jovial
rotund
figure
in
shirt
and
trousers
presented
himself
mr
josiah
brown
suppose
said
holmes
yes
sir
and
you
no
doubt
are
mr
sherlock
holmes
had
the
note
which
you
sent
by
the
express
messenger
and
did
exactly
what
you
told
me
we
locked
every
door
on
the
inside
and
awaited
developments
well
very
glad
to
see
that
you
have
got
the
rascal
hope
gentlemen
that
you
will
come
in
and
have
some
refreshment
however
lestrade
was
anxious
to
get
his
man
into
safe
quarters
so
within
few
minutes
our
cab
had
been
summoned
and
we
were
all
four
upon
our
way
to
london
not
word
would
our
captive
say
but
he
glared
at
us
from
the
shadow
of
his
matted
hair
and
once
when
my
hand
seemed
within
his
reach
he
snapped
at
it
like
hungry
wolf
we
stayed
long
enough
at
the
police
station
to
learn
that
search
of
his
clothing
revealed
nothing
save
few
shillings
and
long
sheath
knife
the
handle
of
which
bore
copious
traces
of
recent
blood
that
all
right
said
lestrade
as
we
parted
hill
knows
all
these
gentry
and
he
will
give
name
to
him
you
ll
find
that
my
theory
of
the
mafia
will
work
out
all
right
but
sure
am
exceedingly
obliged
to
you
mr
holmes
for
the
workmanlike
way
in
which
you
laid
hands
upon
him
don
quite
understand
it
all
yet

fear
it
is
rather
too
late
an
hour
for
explanations
said
holmes
besides
there
are
one
or
two
details
which
are
not
finished
off
and
it
is
one
of
those
cases
which
are
worth
working
out
to
the
very
end
if
you
will
come
round
once
more
to
my
rooms
at
six
clock
to
morrow
think
shall
be
able
to
show
you
that
even
now
you
have
not
grasped
the
entire
meaning
of
this
business
which
presents
some
features
which
make
it
absolutely
original
in
the
history
of
crime
if
ever
permit
you
to
chronicle
any
more
of
my
little
problems
watson
foresee
that
you
will
enliven
your
pages
by
an
account
of
the
singular
adventure
of
the
napoleonic
busts
when
we
met
again
next
evening
lestrade
was
furnished
with
much
information
concerning
our
prisoner
his
name
it
appeared
was
beppo
second
name
unknown
he
was
well
known
ne
er
do
well
among
the
italian
colony
he
had
once
been
skilful
sculptor
and
had
earned
an
honest
living
but
he
had
taken
to
evil
courses
and
had
twice
already
been
in
gaol
once
for
petty
theft
and
once
as
we
had
already
heard
for
stabbing
fellow
countryman
he
could
talk
english
perfectly
well
his
reasons
for
destroying
the
busts
were
still
unknown
and
he
refused
to
answer
any
questions
upon
the
subject
but
the
police
had
discovered
that
these
same
busts
might
very
well
have
been
made
by
his
own
hands
since
he
was
engaged
in
this
class
of
work
at
the
establishment
of
gelder
and
co
to
all
this
information
much
of
which
we
already
knew
holmes
listened
with
polite
attention
but
who
knew
him
so
well
could
clearly
see
that
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
and
detected
mixture
of
mingled
uneasiness
and
expectation
beneath
that
mask
which
he
was
wont
to
assume
at
last
he
started
in
his
chair
and
his
eyes
brightened
there
had
been
ring
at
the
bell
minute
later
we
heard
steps
upon
the
stairs
and
an
elderly
red
faced
man
with
grizzled
side
whiskers
was
ushered
in
his
right
hand
he
carried
an
old
fashioned
carpet
bag
which
he
placed
upon
the
table
is
mr
sherlock
holmes
here
my
friend
bowed
and
smiled
mr
sandeford
of
reading
suppose
said
he
yes
sir
fear
that
am
little
late
but
the
trains
were
awkward
you
wrote
to
me
about
bust
that
is
in
my
possession
exactly
have
your
letter
here
you
said
desire
to
possess
copy
of
devine
napoleon
and
am
prepared
to
pay
you
ten
pounds
for
the
one
which
is
in
your
possession
is
that
right
certainly
was
very
much
surprised
at
your
letter
for
could
not
imagine
how
you
knew
that
owned
such
thing
of
course
you
must
have
been
surprised
but
the
explanation
is
very
simple
mr
harding
of
harding
brothers
said
that
they
had
sold
you
their
last
copy
and
he
gave
me
your
address
oh
that
was
it
was
it
did
he
tell
you
what
paid
for
it
no
he
did
not
well
am
an
honest
man
though
not
very
rich
one
only
gave
fifteen
shillings
for
the
bust
and
think
you
ought
to
know
that
before
take
ten
pounds
from
you
am
sure
the
scruple
does
you
honour
mr
sandeford
but
have
named
that
price
so
intend
to
stick
to
it
well
it
is
very
handsome
of
you
mr
holmes
brought
the
bust
up
with
me
as
you
asked
me
to
do
here
it
is
he
opened
his
bag
and
at
last
we
saw
placed
upon
our
table
complete
specimen
of
that
bust
which
we
had
already
seen
more
than
once
in
fragments
holmes
took
paper
from
his
pocket
and
laid
ten
pound
note
upon
the
table
you
will
kindly
sign
that
paper
mr
sandeford
in
the
presence
of
these
witnesses
it
is
simply
to
say
that
you
transfer
every
possible
right
that
you
ever
had
in
the
bust
to
me
am
methodical
man
you
see
and
you
never
know
what
turn
events
might
take
afterwards
thank
you
mr
sandeford
here
is
your
money
and
wish
you
very
good
evening
when
our
visitor
had
disappeared
sherlock
holmes
movements
were
such
as
to
rivet
our
attention
he
began
by
taking
clean
white
cloth
from
drawer
and
laying
it
over
the
table
then
he
placed
his
newly
acquired
bust
in
the
centre
of
the
cloth
finally
he
picked
up
his
hunting
crop
and
struck
napoleon
sharp
blow
on
the
top
of
the
head
the
figure
broke
into
fragments
and
holmes
bent
eagerly
over
the
shattered
remains
next
instant
with
loud
shout
of
triumph
he
held
up
one
splinter
in
which
round
dark
object
was
fixed
like
plum
in
pudding
gentlemen
he
cried
let
me
introduce
you
to
the
famous
black
pearl
of
the
borgias
lestrade
and
sat
silent
for
moment
and
then
with
spontaneous
impulse
we
both
broke
out
clapping
as
at
the
well
wrought
crisis
of
play
flush
of
colour
sprang
to
holmes
pale
cheeks
and
he
bowed
to
us
like
the
master
dramatist
who
receives
the
homage
of
his
audience
it
was
at
such
moments
that
for
an
instant
he
ceased
to
be
reasoning
machine
and
betrayed
his
human
love
for
admiration
and
applause
the
same
singularly
proud
and
reserved
nature
which
turned
away
with
disdain
from
popular
notoriety
was
capable
of
being
moved
to
its
depths
by
spontaneous
wonder
and
praise
from
friend
yes
gentlemen
said
he
it
is
the
most
famous
pearl
now
existing
in
the
world
and
it
has
been
my
good
fortune
by
connected
chain
of
inductive
reasoning
to
trace
it
from
the
prince
of
colonna
bedroom
at
the
dacre
hotel
where
it
was
lost
to
the
interior
of
this
the
last
of
the
six
busts
of
napoleon
which
were
manufactured
by
gelder
and
co
of
stepney
you
will
remember
lestrade
the
sensation
caused
by
the
disappearance
of
this
valuable
jewel
and
the
vain
efforts
of
the
london
police
to
recover
it
was
myself
consulted
upon
the
case
but
was
unable
to
throw
any
light
upon
it
suspicion
fell
upon
the
maid
of
the
princess
who
was
an
italian
and
it
was
proved
that
she
had
brother
in
london
but
we
failed
to
trace
any
connection
between
them
the
maid
name
was
lucretia
venucci
and
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
this
pietro
who
was
murdered
two
nights
ago
was
the
brother
have
been
looking
up
the
dates
in
the
old
files
of
the
paper
and
find
that
the
disappearance
of
the
pearl
was
exactly
two
days
before
the
arrest
of
beppo
for
some
crime
of
violence
an
event
which
took
place
in
the
factory
of
gelder
and
co
at
the
very
moment
when
these
busts
were
being
made
now
you
clearly
see
the
sequence
of
events
though
you
see
them
of
course
in
the
inverse
order
to
the
way
in
which
they
presented
themselves
to
me
beppo
had
the
pearl
in
his
possession
he
may
have
stolen
it
from
pietro
he
may
have
been
pietro
confederate
he
may
have
been
the
go
between
of
pietro
and
his
sister
it
is
of
no
consequence
to
us
which
is
the
correct
solution
the
main
fact
is
that
he
had
the
pearl
and
at
that
moment
when
it
was
on
his
person
he
was
pursued
by
the
police
he
made
for
the
factory
in
which
he
worked
and
he
knew
that
he
had
only
few
minutes
in
which
to
conceal
this
enormously
valuable
prize
which
would
otherwise
be
found
on
him
when
he
was
searched
six
plaster
casts
of
napoleon
were
drying
in
the
passage
one
of
them
was
still
soft
in
an
instant
beppo
skilful
workman
made
small
hole
in
the
wet
plaster
dropped
in
the
pearl
and
with
few
touches
covered
over
the
aperture
once
more
it
was
an
admirable
hiding
place
no
one
could
possibly
find
it
but
beppo
was
condemned
to
year
imprisonment
and
in
the
meanwhile
his
six
busts
were
scattered
over
london
he
could
not
tell
which
contained
his
treasure
only
by
breaking
them
could
he
see
even
shaking
would
tell
him
nothing
for
as
the
plaster
was
wet
it
was
probable
that
the
pearl
would
adhere
to
it
as
in
fact
it
has
done
beppo
did
not
despair
and
he
conducted
his
search
with
considerable
ingenuity
and
perseverance
through
cousin
who
works
with
gelder
he
found
out
the
retail
firms
who
had
bought
the
busts
he
managed
to
find
employment
with
morse
hudson
and
in
that
way
tracked
down
three
of
them
the
pearl
was
not
there
then
with
the
help
of
some
italian
employe
he
succeeded
in
finding
out
where
the
other
three
busts
had
gone
the
first
was
at
harker
there
he
was
dogged
by
his
confederate
who
held
beppo
responsible
for
the
loss
of
the
pearl
and
he
stabbed
him
in
the
scuffle
which
followed
if
he
was
his
confederate
why
should
he
carry
his
photograph
asked
as
means
of
tracing
him
if
he
wished
to
inquire
about
him
from
any
third
person
that
was
the
obvious
reason
well
after
the
murder
calculated
that
beppo
would
probably
hurry
rather
than
delay
his
movements
he
would
fear
that
the
police
would
read
his
secret
and
so
he
hastened
on
before
they
should
get
ahead
of
him
of
course
could
not
say
that
he
had
not
found
the
pearl
in
harker
bust
had
not
even
concluded
for
certain
that
it
was
the
pearl
but
it
was
evident
to
me
that
he
was
looking
for
something
since
he
carried
the
bust
past
the
other
houses
in
order
to
break
it
in
the
garden
which
had
lamp
overlooking
it
since
harker
bust
was
one
in
three
the
chances
were
exactly
as
told
you
two
to
one
against
the
pearl
being
inside
it
there
remained
two
busts
and
it
was
obvious
that
he
would
go
for
the
london
one
first
warned
the
inmates
of
the
house
so
as
to
avoid
second
tragedy
and
we
went
down
with
the
happiest
results
by
that
time
of
course
knew
for
certain
that
it
was
the
borgia
pearl
that
we
were
after
the
name
of
the
murdered
man
linked
the
one
event
with
the
other
there
only
remained
single
bust
the
reading
one
and
the
pearl
must
be
there
bought
it
in
your
presence
from
the
owner
and
there
it
lies

we
sat
in
silence
for
moment
well
said
lestrade
ve
seen
you
handle
good
many
cases
mr
holmes
but
don
know
that
ever
knew
more
workmanlike
one
than
that
we
re
not
jealous
of
you
at
scotland
yard
no
sir
we
are
very
proud
of
you
and
if
you
come
down
to
morrow
there
not
man
from
the
oldest
inspector
to
the
youngest
constable
who
wouldn
be
glad
to
shake
you
by
the
hand
thank
you
said
holmes
thank
you
and
as
he
turned
away
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
more
nearly
moved
by
the
softer
human
emotions
than
had
ever
seen
him
moment
later
he
was
the
cold
and
practical
thinker
once
more
put
the
pearl
in
the
safe
watson
said
he
and
get
out
the
papers
of
the
conk
singleton
forgery
case
good
bye
lestrade
if
any
little
problem
comes
your
way
shall
be
happy
if
can
to
give
you
hint
or
two
as
to
its
solution
ix
the
adventure
of
the
three
students
it
was
in
the
year
95
that
combination
of
events
into
which
need
not
enter
caused
mr
sherlock
holmes
and
myself
to
spend
some
weeks
in
one
of
our
great
university
towns
and
it
was
during
this
time
that
the
small
but
instructive
adventure
which
am
about
to
relate
befell
us
it
will
be
obvious
that
any
details
which
would
help
the
reader
to
exactly
identify
the
college
or
the
criminal
would
be
injudicious
and
offensive
so
painful
scandal
may
well
be
allowed
to
die
out
with
due
discretion
the
incident
itself
may
however
be
described
since
it
serves
to
illustrate
some
of
those
qualities
for
which
my
friend
was
remarkable
will
endeavour
in
my
statement
to
avoid
such
terms
as
would
serve
to
limit
the
events
to
any
particular
place
or
give
clue
as
to
the
people
concerned
we
were
residing
at
the
time
in
furnished
lodgings
close
to
library
where
sherlock
holmes
was
pursuing
some
laborious
researches
in
early
english
charters
researches
which
led
to
results
so
striking
that
they
may
be
the
subject
of
one
of
my
future
narratives
here
it
was
that
one
evening
we
received
visit
from
an
acquaintance
mr
hilton
soames
tutor
and
lecturer
at
the
college
of
st
luke
mr
soames
was
tall
spare
man
of
nervous
and
excitable
temperament
had
always
known
him
to
be
restless
in
his
manner
but
on
this
particular
occasion
he
was
in
such
state
of
uncontrollable
agitation
that
it
was
clear
something
very
unusual
had
occurred
trust
mr
holmes
that
you
can
spare
me
few
hours
of
your
valuable
time
we
have
had
very
painful
incident
at
st
luke
and
really
but
for
the
happy
chance
of
your
being
in
the
town
should
have
been
at
loss
what
to
do
am
very
busy
just
now
and
desire
no
distractions
my
friend
answered
should
much
prefer
that
you
called
in
the
aid
of
the
police
no
my
dear
sir
such
course
is
utterly
impossible
when
once
the
law
is
evoked
it
cannot
be
stayed
again
and
this
is
just
one
of
those
cases
where
for
the
credit
of
the
college
it
is
most
essential
to
avoid
scandal
your
discretion
is
as
well
known
as
your
powers
and
you
are
the
one
man
in
the
world
who
can
help
me
beg
you
mr
holmes
to
do
what
you
can
my
friend
temper
had
not
improved
since
he
had
been
deprived
of
the
congenial
surroundings
of
baker
street
without
his
scrap
books
his
chemicals
and
his
homely
untidiness
he
was
an
uncomfortable
man
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
ungracious
acquiescence
while
our
visitor
in
hurried
words
and
with
much
excitable
gesticulation
poured
forth
his
story
must
explain
to
you
mr
holmes
that
to
morrow
is
the
first
day
of
the
examination
for
the
fortescue
scholarship
am
one
of
the
examiners
my
subject
is
greek
and
the
first
of
the
papers
consists
of
large
passage
of
greek
translation
which
the
candidate
has
not
seen
this
passage
is
printed
on
the
examination
paper
and
it
would
naturally
be
an
immense
advantage
if
the
candidate
could
prepare
it
in
advance
for
this
reason
great
care
is
taken
to
keep
the
paper
secret
to
day
about
three
clock
the
proofs
of
this
paper
arrived
from
the
printers
the
exercise
consists
of
half
chapter
of
thucydides
had
to
read
it
over
carefully
as
the
text
must
be
absolutely
correct
at
four
thirty
my
task
was
not
yet
completed
had
however
promised
to
take
tea
in
friend
rooms
so
left
the
proof
upon
my
desk
was
absent
rather
more
than
an
hour
you
are
aware
mr
holmes
that
our
college
doors
are
double
green
baize
one
within
and
heavy
oak
one
without
as
approached
my
outer
door
was
amazed
to
see
key
in
it
for
an
instant
imagined
that
had
left
my
own
there
but
on
feeling
in
my
pocket
found
that
it
was
all
right
the
only
duplicate
which
existed
so
far
as
knew
was
that
which
belonged
to
my
servant
bannister
man
who
has
looked
after
my
room
for
ten
years
and
whose
honesty
is
absolutely
above
suspicion
found
that
the
key
was
indeed
his
that
he
had
entered
my
room
to
know
if
wanted
tea
and
that
he
had
very
carelessly
left
the
key
in
the
door
when
he
came
out
his
visit
to
my
room
must
have
been
within
very
few
minutes
of
my
leaving
it
his
forgetfulness
about
the
key
would
have
mattered
little
upon
any
other
occasion
but
on
this
one
day
it
has
produced
the
most
deplorable
consequences
the
moment
looked
at
my
table
was
aware
that
someone
had
rummaged
among
my
papers
the
proof
was
in
three
long
slips
had
left
them
all
together
now
found
that
one
of
them
was
lying
on
the
floor
one
was
on
the
side
table
near
the
window
and
the
third
was
where
had
left
it
holmes
stirred
for
the
first
time
the
first
page
on
the
floor
the
second
in
the
window
the
third
where
you
left
it
said
he
exactly
mr
holmes
you
amaze
me
how
could
you
possibly
know
that
pray
continue
your
very
interesting
statement
for
an
instant
imagined
that
bannister
had
taken
the
unpardonable
liberty
of
examining
my
papers
he
denied
it
however
with
the
utmost
earnestness
and
am
convinced
that
he
was
speaking
the
truth
the
alternative
was
that
someone
passing
had
observed
the
key
in
the
door
had
known
that
was
out
and
had
entered
to
look
at
the
papers
large
sum
of
money
is
at
stake
for
the
scholarship
is
very
valuable
one
and
an
unscrupulous
man
might
very
well
run
risk
in
order
to
gain
an
advantage
over
his
fellows
bannister
was
very
much
upset
by
the
incident
he
had
nearly
fainted
when
we
found
that
the
papers
had
undoubtedly
been
tampered
with
gave
him
little
brandy
and
left
him
collapsed
in
chair
while
made
most
careful
examination
of
the
room
soon
saw
that
the
intruder
had
left
other
traces
of
his
presence
besides
the
rumpled
papers
on
the
table
in
the
window
were
several
shreds
from
pencil
which
had
been
sharpened
broken
tip
of
lead
was
lying
there
also
evidently
the
rascal
had
copied
the
paper
in
great
hurry
had
broken
his
pencil
and
had
been
compelled
to
put
fresh
point
to
it
excellent
said
holmes
who
was
recovering
his
good
humour
as
his
attention
became
more
engrossed
by
the
case
fortune
has
been
your
friend
this
was
not
all
have
new
writing
table
with
fine
surface
of
red
leather
am
prepared
to
swear
and
so
is
bannister
that
it
was
smooth
and
unstained
now
found
clean
cut
in
it
about
three
inches
long
not
mere
scratch
but
positive
cut
not
only
this
but
on
the
table
found
small
ball
of
black
dough
or
clay
with
specks
of
something
which
looks
like
sawdust
in
it
am
convinced
that
these
marks
were
left
by
the
man
who
rifled
the
papers
there
were
no
footmarks
and
no
other
evidence
as
to
his
identity
was
at
my
wits
ends
when
suddenly
the
happy
thought
occurred
to
me
that
you
were
in
the
town
and
came
straight
round
to
put
the
matter
into
your
hands
do
help
me
mr
holmes
you
see
my
dilemma
either
must
find
the
man
or
else
the
examination
must
be
postponed
until
fresh
papers
are
prepared
and
since
this
cannot
be
done
without
explanation
there
will
ensue
hideous
scandal
which
will
throw
cloud
not
only
on
the
college
but
on
the
university
above
all
things
desire
to
settle
the
matter
quietly
and
discreetly
shall
be
happy
to
look
into
it
and
to
give
you
such
advice
as
can
said
holmes
rising
and
putting
on
his
overcoat
the
case
is
not
entirely
devoid
of
interest
had
anyone
visited
you
in
your
room
after
the
papers
came
to
you
yes
young
daulat
ras
an
indian
student
who
lives
on
the
same
stair
came
in
to
ask
me
some
particulars
about
the
examination
for
which
he
was
entered
yes
and
the
papers
were
on
your
table
to
the
best
of
my
belief
they
were
rolled
up
but
might
be
recognised
as
proofs
possibly
no
one
else
in
your
room
no
did
anyone
know
that
these
proofs
would
be
there
no
one
save
the
printer
did
this
man
bannister
know
no
certainly
not
no
one
knew

where
is
bannister
now
he
was
very
ill
poor
fellow
left
him
collapsed
in
the
chair
was
in
such
hurry
to
come
to
you
left
your
door
open
locked
up
the
papers
first
then
it
amounts
to
this
mr
soames
that
unless
the
indian
student
recognised
the
roll
as
being
proofs
the
man
who
tampered
with
them
came
upon
them
accidentally
without
knowing
that
they
were
there
so
it
seems
to
me
holmes
gave
an
enigmatic
smile
well
said
he
let
us
go
round
not
one
of
your
cases
watson
mental
not
physical
all
right
come
if
you
want
to
now
mr
soames
at
your
disposal
the
sitting
room
of
our
client
opened
by
long
low
latticed
window
on
to
the
ancient
lichen
tinted
court
of
the
old
college
gothic
arched
door
led
to
worn
stone
staircase
on
the
ground
floor
was
the
tutor
room
above
were
three
students
one
on
each
story
it
was
already
twilight
when
we
reached
the
scene
of
our
problem
holmes
halted
and
looked
earnestly
at
the
window
then
he
approached
it
and
standing
on
tiptoe
with
his
neck
craned
he
looked
into
the
room
he
must
have
entered
through
the
door
there
is
no
opening
except
the
one
pane
said
our
learned
guide
dear
me
said
holmes
and
he
smiled
in
singular
way
as
he
glanced
at
our
companion
well
if
there
is
nothing
to
be
learned
here
we
had
best
go
inside
the
lecturer
unlocked
the
outer
door
and
ushered
us
into
his
room
we
stood
at
the
entrance
while
holmes
made
an
examination
of
the
carpet
am
afraid
there
are
no
signs
here
said
he
one
could
hardly
hope
for
any
upon
so
dry
day
your
servant
seems
to
have
quite
recovered
you
left
him
in
chair
you
say
which
chair
by
the
window
there
see
near
this
little
table
you
can
come
in
now
have
finished
with
the
carpet
let
us
take
the
little
table
first
of
course
what
has
happened
is
very
clear
the
man
entered
and
took
the
papers
sheet
by
sheet
from
the
central
table
he
carried
them
over
to
the
window
table
because
from
there
he
could
see
if
you
came
across
the
courtyard
and
so
could
effect
an
escape
as
matter
of
fact
he
could
not
said
soames
for
entered
by
the
side
door
ah
that
good
well
anyhow
that
was
in
his
mind
let
me
see
the
three
strips
no
finger
impressions
no
well
he
carried
over
this
one
first
and
he
copied
it
how
long
would
it
take
him
to
do
that
using
every
possible
contraction
quarter
of
an
hour
not
less
then
he
tossed
it
down
and
seized
the
next
he
was
in
the
midst
of
that
when
your
return
caused
him
to
make
very
hurried
retreat
very
hurried
since
he
had
not
time
to
replace
the
papers
which
would
tell
you
that
he
had
been
there
you
were
not
aware
of
any
hurrying
feet
on
the
stair
as
you
entered
the
outer
door
no
can
say
was
well
he
wrote
so
furiously
that
he
broke
his
pencil
and
had
as
you
observe
to
sharpen
it
again
this
is
of
interest
watson
the
pencil
was
not
an
ordinary
one
it
was
above
the
usual
size
with
soft
lead
the
outer
colour
was
dark
blue
the
maker
name
was
printed
in
silver
lettering
and
the
piece
remaining
is
only
about
an
inch
and
half
long
look
for
such
pencil
mr
soames
and
you
have
got
your
man
when
add
that
he
possesses
large
and
very
blunt
knife
you
have
an
additional
aid
mr
soames
was
somewhat
overwhelmed
by
this
flood
of
information
can
follow
the
other
points
said
he
but
really
in
this
matter
of
the
length
holmes
held
out
small
chip
with
the
letters
nn
and
space
of
clear
wood
after
them
you
see
no
fear
that
even
now
watson
have
always
done
you
an
injustice
there
are
others
what
could
this
nn
be
it
is
at
the
end
of
word
you
are
aware
that
johann
faber
is
the
most
common
maker
name
is
it
not
clear
that
there
is
just
as
much
of
the
pencil
left
as
usually
follows
the
johann
he
held
the
small
table
sideways
to
the
electric
light
was
hoping
that
if
the
paper
on
which
he
wrote
was
thin
some
trace
of
it
might
come
through
upon
this
polished
surface
no
see
nothing
don
think
there
is
anything
more
to
be
learned
here
now
for
the
central
table
this
small
pellet
is
presume
the
black
doughy
mass
you
spoke
of
roughly
pyramidal
in
shape
and
hollowed
out
perceive
as
you
say
there
appear
to
be
grains
of
sawdust
in
it
dear
me
this
is
very
interesting
and
the
cut
positive
tear
see
it
began
with
thin
scratch
and
ended
in
jagged
hole
am
much
indebted
to
you
for
directing
my
attention
to
this
case
mr
soames
where
does
that
door
lead
to
my
bedroom
have
you
been
in
it
since
your
adventure
no
came
straight
away
for
you
should
like
to
have
glance
round
what
charming
old
fashioned
room
perhaps
you
will
kindly
wait
minute
until
have
examined
the
floor
no
see
nothing
what
about
this
curtain
you
hang
your
clothes
behind
it
if
anyone
were
forced
to
conceal
himself
in
this
room
he
must
do
it
there
since
the
bed
is
too
low
and
the
wardrobe
too
shallow
no
one
there
suppose
as
holmes
drew
the
curtain
was
aware
from
some
little
rigidity
and
alertness
of
his
attitude
that
he
was
prepared
for
an
emergency
as
matter
of
fact
the
drawn
curtain
disclosed
nothing
but
three
or
four
suits
of
clothes
hanging
from
line
of
pegs
holmes
turned
away
and
stooped
suddenly
to
the
floor
halloa
what
this
said
he
it
was
small
pyramid
of
black
putty
like
stuff
exactly
like
the
one
upon
the
table
of
the
study
holmes
held
it
out
on
his
open
palm
in
the
glare
of
the
electric
light
your
visitor
seems
to
have
left
traces
in
your
bedroom
as
well
as
in
your
sitting
room
mr
soames
what
could
he
have
wanted
there
think
it
is
clear
enough
you
came
back
by
an
unexpected
way
and
so
he
had
no
warning
until
you
were
at
the
very
door
what
could
he
do
he
caught
up
everything
which
would
betray
him
and
he
rushed
into
your
bedroom
to
conceal
himself
good
gracious
mr
holmes
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
all
the
time
was
talking
to
bannister
in
this
room
we
had
the
man
prisoner
if
we
had
only
known
it
so
read
it
surely
there
is
another
alternative
mr
holmes
don
know
whether
you
observed
my
bedroom
window
lattice
paned
lead
framework
three
separate
windows
one
swinging
on
hinge
and
large
enough
to
admit
man
exactly
and
it
looks
out
on
an
angle
of
the
courtyard
so
as
to
be
partly
invisible
the
man
might
have
effected
his
entrance
there
left
traces
as
he
passed
through
the
bedroom
and
finally
finding
the
door
open
have
escaped
that
way
holmes
shook
his
head
impatiently
let
us
be
practical
said
he
understand
you
to
say
that
there
are
three
students
who
use
this
stair
and
are
in
the
habit
of
passing
your
door
yes
there
are
and
they
are
all
in
for
this
examination
yes
have
you
any
reason
to
suspect
any
one
of
them
more
than
the
others
soames
hesitated
it
is
very
delicate
question
said
he
one
hardly
likes
to
throw
suspicion
where
there
are
no
proofs
let
us
hear
the
suspicions
will
look
after
the
proofs
will
tell
you
then
in
few
words
the
character
of
the
three
men
who
inhabit
these
rooms
the
lower
of
the
three
is
gilchrist
fine
scholar
and
athlete
plays
in
the
rugby
team
and
the
cricket
team
for
the
college
and
got
his
blue
for
the
hurdles
and
the
long
jump
he
is
fine
manly
fellow
his
father
was
the
notorious
sir
jabez
gilchrist
who
ruined
himself
on
the
turf
my
scholar
has
been
left
very
poor
but
he
is
hard
working
and
industrious
he
will
do
well
the
second
floor
is
inhabited
by
daulat
ras
the
indian
he
is
quiet
inscrutable
fellow
as
most
of
those
indians
are
he
is
well
up
in
his
work
though
his
greek
is
his
weak
subject
he
is
steady
and
methodical
the
top
floor
belongs
to
miles
mcLaren
he
is
brilliant
fellow
when
he
chooses
to
work
one
of
the
brightest
intellects
of
the
university
but
he
is
wayward
dissipated
and
unprincipled
he
was
nearly
expelled
over
card
scandal
in
his
first
year
he
has
been
idling
all
this
term
and
he
must
look
forward
with
dread
to
the
examination
then
it
is
he
whom
you
suspect
dare
not
go
so
far
as
that
but
of
the
three
he
is
perhaps
the
least
unlikely
exactly
now
mr
soames
let
us
have
look
at
your
servant
bannister
he
was
little
white
faced
clean
shaven
grizzly
haired
fellow
of
fifty
he
was
still
suffering
from
this
sudden
disturbance
of
the
quiet
routine
of
his
life
his
plump
face
was
twitching
with
his
nervousness
and
his
fingers
could
not
keep
still
we
are
investigating
this
unhappy
business
bannister
said
his
master
yes
sir
understand
said
holmes
that
you
left
your
key
in
the
door
страница

392
yes
sir
was
it
not
very
extraordinary
that
you
should
do
this
on
the
very
day
when
there
were
these
papers
inside
it
was
most
unfortunate
sir
but
have
occasionally
done
the
same
thing
at
other
times
when
did
you
enter
the
room
it
was
about
half
past
four
that
is
mr
soames
tea
time
how
long
did
you
stay
when
saw
that
he
was
absent
withdrew
at
once
did
you
look
at
these
papers
on
the
table
no
sir
certainly
not
how
came
you
to
leave
the
key
in
the
door
had
the
tea
tray
in
my
hand
thought
would
come
back
for
the
key
then
forgot
has
the
outer
door
spring
lock
no
sir
then
it
was
open
all
the
time
yes
sir
anyone
in
the
room
could
get
out
yes
sir
when
mr
soames
returned
and
called
for
you
were
very
much
disturbed
yes
sir
such
thing
has
never
happened
during
the
many
years
that
have
been
here
nearly
fainted
sir
so
understand
where
were
you
when
you
began
to
feel
bad
where
was
sir
why
here
near
the
door
that
is
singular
because
you
sat
down
in
that
chair
over
yonder
near
the
corner
why
did
you
pass
these
other
chairs
don
know
sir
it
didn
matter
to
me
where
sat
really
don
think
he
knew
much
about
it
mr
holmes
he
was
looking
very
bad
quite
ghastly
you
stayed
here
when
your
master
left
only
for
minute
or
so
then
locked
the
door
and
went
to
my
room
whom
do
you
suspect
oh
would
not
venture
to
say
sir
don
believe
there
is
any
gentleman
in
this
university
who
is
capable
of
profiting
by
such
an
action
no
sir
ll
not
believe
it
thank
you
that
will
do
said
holmes
oh
one
more
word
you
have
not
mentioned
to
any
of
the
three
gentlemen
whom
you
attend
that
anything
is
amiss
no
sir
not
word
you
haven
seen
any
of
them
no
sir
very
good
now
mr
soames
we
will
take
walk
in
the
quadrangle
if
you
please
three
yellow
squares
of
light
shone
above
us
in
the
gathering
gloom
your
three
birds
are
all
in
their
nests
said
holmes
looking
up
halloa
what
that
one
of
them
seems
restless
enough
it
was
the
indian
whose
dark
silhouette
appeared
suddenly
upon
his
blind
he
was
pacing
swiftly
up
and
down
his
room
should
like
to
have
peep
at
each
of
them
said
holmes
is
it
possible
no
difficulty
in
the
world
soames
answered
this
set
of
rooms
is
quite
the
oldest
in
the
college
and
it
is
not
unusual
for
visitors
to
go
over
them
come
along
and
will
personally
conduct
you
no
names
please
said
holmes
as
we
knocked
at
gilchrist
door
tall
flaxen
haired
slim
young
fellow
opened
it
and
made
us
welcome
when
he
understood
our
errand
there
were
some
really
curious
pieces
of
mediaeval
domestic
architecture
within
holmes
was
so
charmed
with
one
of
them
that
he
insisted
on
drawing
it
on
his
note
book
broke
his
pencil
had
to
borrow
one
from
our
host
and
finally
borrowed
knife
to
sharpen
his
own
the
same
curious
accident
happened
to
him
in
the
rooms
of
the
indian
silent
little
hook
nosed
fellow
who
eyed
us
askance
and
was
obviously
glad
when
holmes
architectural
studies
had
come
to
an
end
could
not
see
that
in
either
case
holmes
had
come
upon
the
clue
for
which
he
was
searching
only
at
the
third
did
our
visit
prove
abortive
the
outer
door
would
not
open
to
our
knock
and
nothing
more
substantial
than
torrent
of
bad
language
came
from
behind
it
don
care
who
you
are
you
can
go
to
blazes
roared
the
angry
voice
to
morrow
the
exam
and
won
be
drawn
by
anyone
rude
fellow
said
our
guide
flushing
with
anger
as
we
withdrew
down
the
stair
of
course
he
did
not
realize
that
it
was
who
was
knocking
but
none
the
less
his
conduct
was
very
uncourteous
and
indeed
under
the
circumstances
rather
suspicious
holmes
response
was
curious
one
can
you
tell
me
his
exact
height
he
asked
really
mr
holmes
cannot
undertake
to
say
he
is
taller
than
the
indian
not
so
tall
as
gilchrist
suppose
five
foot
six
would
be
about
it
that
is
very
important
said
holmes
and
now
mr
soames
wish
you
good
night
our
guide
cried
aloud
in
his
astonishment
and
dismay
good
gracious
mr
holmes
you
are
surely
not
going
to
leave
me
in
this
abrupt
fashion
you
don
seem
to
realize
the
position
to
morrow
is
the
examination
must
take
some
definite
action
to
night
cannot
allow
the
examination
to
be
held
if
one
of
the
papers
has
been
tampered
with
the
situation
must
be
faced
you
must
leave
it
as
it
is
shall
drop
round
early
to
morrow
morning
and
chat
the
matter
over
it
is
possible
that
may
be
in
position
then
to
indicate
some
course
of
action
meanwhile
you
change
nothing
at
all
very
good
mr
holmes
you
can
be
perfectly
easy
in
your
mind
we
shall
certainly
find
some
way
out
of
your
difficulties
will
take
the
black
clay
with
me
also
the
pencil
cuttings
good
bye
when
we
were
out
in
the
darkness
of
the
quadrangle
we
again
looked
up
at
the
windows
the
indian
still
paced
his
room
the
others
were
invisible
well
watson
what
do
you
think
of
it
holmes
asked
as
we
came
out
into
the
main
street
quite
little
parlour
game
sort
of
three
card
trick
is
it
not
there
are
your
three
men
it
must
be
one
of
them
you
take
your
choice
which
is
yours
the
foul
mouthed
fellow
at
the
top
he
is
the
one
with
the
worst
record
and
yet
that
indian
was
sly
fellow
also
why
should
he
be
pacing
his
room
all
the
time
there
is
nothing
in
that
many
men
do
it
when
they
are
trying
to
learn
anything
by
heart
he
looked
at
us
in
queer
way
so
would
you
if
flock
of
strangers
came
in
on
you
when
you
were
preparing
for
an
examination
next
day
and
every
moment
was
of
value
no
see
nothing
in
that
pencils
too
and
knives
all
was
satisfactory
but
that
fellow
does
puzzle
me
who
why
bannister
the
servant
what
his
game
in
the
matter
he
impressed
me
as
being
perfectly
honest
man
so
he
did
me
that
the
puzzling
part
why
should
perfectly
honest
man
well
here
large
stationer
we
shall
begin
our
researches
here
there
were
only
four
stationers
of
any
consequence
in
the
town
and
at
each
holmes
produced
his
pencil
chips
and
bid
high
for
duplicate
all
were
agreed
that
one
could
be
ordered
but
that
it
was
not
usual
size
of
pencil
and
that
it
was
seldom
kept
in
stock
my
friend
did
not
appear
to
be
depressed
by
his
failure
but
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
half
humorous
resignation
no
good
my
dear
watson
this
the
best
and
only
final
clue
has
run
to
nothing
but
indeed
have
little
doubt
that
we
can
build
up
sufficient
case
without
it
by
jove
my
dear
fellow
it
is
nearly
nine
and
the
landlady
babbled
of
green
peas
at
seven
thirty
what
with
your
eternal
tobacco
watson
and
your
irregularity
at
meals
expect
that
you
will
get
notice
to
quit
and
that
shall
share
your
downfall
not
however
before
we
have
solved
the
problem
of
the
nervous
tutor
the
careless
servant
and
the
three
enterprising
students
holmes
made
no
further
allusion
to
the
matter
that
day
though
he
sat
lost
in
thought
for
long
time
after
our
belated
dinner
at
eight
in
the
morning
he
came
into
my
room
just
as
finished
my
toilet
well
watson
said
he
it
is
time
we
went
down
to
st
luke
can
you
do
without
breakfast
certainly
soames
will
be
in
dreadful
fidget
until
we
are
able
to
tell
him
something
positive
have
you
anything
positive
to
tell
him
think
so
you
have
formed
conclusion
yes
my
dear
watson
have
solved
the
mystery
but
what
fresh
evidence
could
you
have
got
aha
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
have
turned
myself
out
of
bed
at
the
untimely
hour
of
six
have
put
in
two
hours
hard
work
and
covered
at
least
five
miles
with
something
to
show
for
it
look
at
that
he
held
out
his
hand
on
the
palm
were
three
little
pyramids
of
black
doughy
clay
why
holmes
you
had
only
two
yesterday
and
one
more
this
morning
it
is
fair
argument
that
wherever
no
came
from
is
also
the
source
of
nos
and
eh
watson
well
come
along
and
put
friend
soames
out
of
his
pain
the
unfortunate
tutor
was
certainly
in
state
of
pitiable
agitation
when
we
found
him
in
his
chambers
in
few
hours
the
examination
would
commence
and
he
was
still
in
the
dilemma
between
making
the
facts
public
and
allowing
the
culprit
to
compete
for
the
valuable
scholarship
he
could
hardly
stand
still
so
great
was
his
mental
agitation
and
he
ran
towards
holmes
with
two
eager
hands
outstretched

thank
heaven
that
you
have
come
feared
that
you
had
given
it
up
in
despair
what
am
to
do
shall
the
examination
proceed
yes
let
it
proceed
by
all
means
but
this
rascal
he
shall
not
compete
you
know
him
think
so
if
this
matter
is
not
to
become
public
we
must
give
ourselves
certain
powers
and
resolve
ourselves
into
small
private
court
martial
you
there
if
you
please
soames
watson
you
here
ll
take
the
arm
chair
in
the
middle
think
that
we
are
now
sufficiently
imposing
to
strike
terror
into
guilty
breast
kindly
ring
the
bell
bannister
entered
and
shrunk
back
in
evident
surprise
and
fear
at
our
judicial
appearance
you
will
kindly
close
the
door
said
holmes
now
bannister
will
you
please
tell
us
the
truth
about
yesterday
incident
the
man
turned
white
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
have
told
you
everything
sir
nothing
to
add
nothing
at
all
sir
well
then
must
make
some
suggestions
to
you
when
you
sat
down
on
that
chair
yesterday
did
you
do
so
in
order
to
conceal
some
object
which
would
have
shown
who
had
been
in
the
room
bannister
face
was
ghastly
no
sir
certainly
not
it
is
only
suggestion
said
holmes
suavely
frankly
admit
that
am
unable
to
prove
it
but
it
seems
probable
enough
since
the
moment
that
mr
soames
back
was
turned
you
released
the
man
who
was
hiding
in
that
bedroom
bannister
licked
his
dry
lips
there
was
no
man
sir
ah
that
pity
bannister
up
to
now
you
may
have
spoken
the
truth
but
now
know
that
you
have
lied
the
man
face
set
in
sullen
defiance
there
was
no
man
sir
come
bannister
no
sir
there
was
no
one
in
that
case
you
can
give
us
no
further
information
would
you
please
remain
in
the
room
stand
over
there
near
the
bedroom
door
now
soames
am
going
to
ask
you
to
have
the
great
kindness
to
go
up
to
the
room
of
young
gilchrist
and
to
ask
him
to
step
down
into
yours
an
instant
later
the
tutor
returned
bringing
with
him
the
student
he
was
fine
figure
of
man
tall
lithe
and
agile
with
springy
step
and
pleasant
open
face
his
troubled
blue
eyes
glanced
at
each
of
us
and
finally
rested
with
an
expression
of
blank
dismay
upon
bannister
in
the
farther
corner
just
close
the
door
said
holmes
now
mr
gilchrist
we
are
all
quite
alone
here
and
no
one
need
ever
know
one
word
of
what
passes
between
us
we
can
be
perfectly
frank
with
each
other
we
want
to
know
mr
gilchrist
how
you
an
honourable
man
ever
came
to
commit
such
an
action
as
that
of
yesterday
the
unfortunate
young
man
staggered
back
and
cast
look
full
of
horror
and
reproach
at
bannister
no
mr
gilchrist
sir
never
said
word
never
one
word
cried
the
servant
no
but
you
have
now
said
holmes
now
sir
you
must
see
that
after
bannister
words
your
position
is
hopeless
and
that
your
only
chance
lies
in
frank
confession
for
moment
gilchrist
with
upraised
hand
tried
to
control
his
writhing
features
the
next
he
had
thrown
himself
on
his
knees
beside
the
table
and
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
he
had
burst
into
storm
of
passionate
sobbing
come
said
holmes
kindly
it
is
human
to
err
and
at
least
no
one
can
accuse
you
of
being
callous
criminal
perhaps
it
would
be
easier
for
you
if
were
to
tell
mr
soames
what
occurred
and
you
can
check
me
where
am
wrong
shall
do
so
well
don
trouble
to
answer
listen
and
see
that
do
you
no
injustice
from
the
moment
mr
soames
that
you
said
to
me
that
no
one
not
even
bannister
could
have
told
that
the
papers
were
in
your
room
the
case
began
to
take
definite
shape
in
my
mind
the
printer
one
could
of
course
dismiss
he
could
examine
the
papers
in
his
own
office
the
indian
also
thought
nothing
of
if
the
proofs
were
in
roll
he
could
not
possibly
know
what
they
were
on
the
other
hand
it
seemed
an
unthinkable
coincidence
that
man
should
dare
to
enter
the
room
and
that
by
chance
on
that
very
day
the
papers
were
on
the
table
dismissed
that
the
man
who
entered
knew
that
the
papers
were
there
how
did
he
know
when
approached
your
room
examined
the
window
you
amused
me
by
supposing
that
was
contemplating
the
possibility
of
someone
having
in
broad
daylight
under
the
eyes
of
all
these
opposite
rooms
forced
himself
through
it
such
an
idea
was
absurd
was
measuring
how
tall
man
would
need
to
be
in
order
to
see
as
he
passed
what
papers
were
on
the
central
table
am
six
feet
high
and
could
do
it
with
an
effort
no
one
less
than
that
would
have
chance
already
you
see
had
reason
to
think
that
if
one
of
your
three
students
was
man
of
unusual
height
he
was
the
most
worth
watching
of
the
three
entered
and
took
you
into
my
confidence
as
to
the
suggestions
of
the
side
table
of
the
centre
table
could
make
nothing
until
in
your
description
of
gilchrist
you
mentioned
that
he
was
long
distance
jumper
then
the
whole
thing
came
to
me
in
an
instant
and
only
needed
certain
corroborative
proofs
which
speedily
obtained
what
happened
was
this
young
fellow
had
employed
his
afternoon
at
the
athletic
grounds
where
he
had
been
practising
the
jump
he
returned
carrying
his
jumping
shoes
which
are
provided
as
you
are
aware
with
several
sharp
spikes
as
he
passed
your
window
he
saw
by
means
of
his
great
height
these
proofs
upon
your
table
and
conjectured
what
they
were
no
harm
would
have
been
done
had
it
not
been
that
as
he
passed
your
door
he
perceived
the
key
which
had
been
left
by
the
carelessness
of
your
servant
sudden
impulse
came
over
him
to
enter
and
see
if
they
were
indeed
the
proofs
it
was
not
dangerous
exploit
for
he
could
always
pretend
that
he
had
simply
looked
in
to
ask
question
well
when
he
saw
that
they
were
indeed
the
proofs
it
was
then
that
he
yielded
to
temptation
he
put
his
shoes
on
the
table
what
was
it
you
put
on
that
chair
near
the
window
gloves
said
the
young
man
holmes
looked
triumphantly
at
bannister
he
put
his
gloves
on
the
chair
and
he
took
the
proofs
sheet
by
sheet
to
copy
them
he
thought
the
tutor
must
return
by
the
main
gate
and
that
he
would
see
him
as
we
know
he
came
back
by
the
side
gate
suddenly
he
heard
him
at
the
very
door
there
was
no
possible
escape
he
forgot
his
gloves
but
he
caught
up
his
shoes
and
darted
into
the
bedroom
you
observe
that
the
scratch
on
that
table
is
slight
at
one
side
but
deepens
in
the
direction
of
the
bedroom
door
that
in
itself
is
enough
to
show
us
that
the
shoe
had
been
drawn
in
that
direction
and
that
the
culprit
had
taken
refuge
there
the
earth
round
the
spike
had
been
left
on
the
table
and
second
sample
was
loosened
and
fell
in
the
bedroom
may
add
that
walked
out
to
the
athletic
grounds
this
morning
saw
that
tenacious
black
clay
is
used
in
the
jumping
pit
and
carried
away
specimen
of
it
together
with
some
of
the
fine
tan
or
sawdust
which
is
strewn
over
it
to
prevent
the
athlete
from
slipping
have
told
the
truth
mr
gilchrist
the
student
had
drawn
himself
erect
yes
sir
it
is
true
said
he
good
heavens
have
you
nothing
to
add
cried
soames
yes
sir
have
but
the
shock
of
this
disgraceful
exposure
has
bewildered
me
have
letter
here
mr
soames
which
wrote
to
you
early
this
morning
in
the
middle
of
restless
night
it
was
before
knew
that
my
sin
had
found
me
out
here
it
is
sir
you
will
see
that
have
said
have
determined
not
to
go
in
for
the
examination
have
been
offered
commission
in
the
rhodesian
police
and
am
going
out
to
south
africa
at
once
am
indeed
pleased
to
hear
that
you
did
not
intend
to
profit
by
your
unfair
advantage
said
soames
but
why
did
you
change
your
purpose
gilchrist
pointed
to
bannister
there
is
the
man
who
set
me
in
the
right
path
said
he
come
now
bannister
said
holmes
it
will
be
clear
to
you
from
what
have
said
that
only
you
could
have
let
this
young
man
out
since
you
were
left
in
the
room
and
must
have
locked
the
door
when
you
went
out
as
to
his
escaping
by
that
window
it
was
incredible
can
you
not
clear
up
the
last
point
in
this
mystery
and
tell
us
the
reasons
for
your
action
it
was
simple
enough
sir
if
you
only
had
known
but
with
all
your
cleverness
it
was
impossible
that
you
could
know
time
was
sir
when
was
butler
to
old
sir
jabez
gilchrist
this
young
gentleman
father
when
he
was
ruined
came
to
the
college
as
servant
but
never
forgot
my
old
employer
because
he
was
down
in
the
world
watched
his
son
all
could
for
the
sake
of
the
old
days
well
sir
when
came
into
this
room
yesterday
when
the
alarm
was
given
the
very
first
thing
saw
was
mr
gilchrist
tan
gloves
lying
in
that
chair
knew
those
gloves
well
and
understood
their
message
if
mr
soames
saw
them
the
game
was
up
flopped
down
into
that
chair
and
nothing
would
budge
me
until
mr
soames
he
went
for
you
then
out
came
my
poor
young
master
whom
had
dandled
on
my
knee
and
confessed
it
all
to
me
wasn
it
natural
sir
that
should
save
him
and
wasn
it
natural
also
that
should
try
to
speak
to
him
as
his
dead
father
would
have
done
and
make
him
understand
that
he
could
not
profit
by
such
deed
could
you
blame
me
sir

no
indeed
said
holmes
heartily
springing
to
his
feet
well
soames
think
we
have
cleared
your
little
problem
up
and
our
breakfast
awaits
us
at
home
come
watson
as
to
you
sir
trust
that
bright
future
awaits
you
in
rhodesia
for
once
you
have
fallen
low
let
us
see
in
the
future
how
high
you
can
rise
the
adventure
of
the
golden
pince
nez
when
look
at
the
three
massive
manuscript
volumes
which
contain
our
work
for
the
year
1894
confess
that
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
out
of
such
wealth
of
material
to
select
the
cases
which
are
most
interesting
in
themselves
and
at
the
same
time
most
conducive
to
display
of
those
peculiar
powers
for
which
my
friend
was
famous
as
turn
over
the
pages
see
my
notes
upon
the
repulsive
story
of
the
red
leech
and
the
terrible
death
of
crosby
the
banker
here
also
find
an
account
of
the
addleton
tragedy
and
the
singular
contents
of
the
ancient
british
barrow
the
famous
smith
mortimer
succession
case
comes
also
within
this
period
and
so
does
the
tracking
and
arrest
of
huret
the
boulevard
assassin
an
exploit
which
won
for
holmes
an
autograph
letter
of
thanks
from
the
french
president
and
the
order
of
the
legion
of
honour
each
of
these
would
furnish
narrative
but
on
the
whole
am
of
opinion
that
none
of
them
unite
so
many
singular
points
of
interest
as
the
episode
of
yoxley
old
place
which
includes
not
only
the
lamentable
death
of
young
willoughby
smith
but
also
those
subsequent
developments
which
threw
so
curious
light
upon
the
causes
of
the
crime
it
was
wild
tempestuous
night
towards
the
close
of
november
holmes
and
sat
together
in
silence
all
the
evening
he
engaged
with
powerful
lens
deciphering
the
remains
of
the
original
inscription
upon
palimpsest
deep
in
recent
treatise
upon
surgery
outside
the
wind
howled
down
baker
street
while
the
rain
beat
fiercely
against
the
windows
it
was
strange
there
in
the
very
depths
of
the
town
with
ten
miles
of
man
handiwork
on
every
side
of
us
to
feel
the
iron
grip
of
nature
and
to
be
conscious
that
to
the
huge
elemental
forces
all
london
was
no
more
than
the
molehills
that
dot
the
fields
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
on
the
deserted
street
the
occasional
lamps
gleamed
on
the
expanse
of
muddy
road
and
shining
pavement
single
cab
was
splashing
its
way
from
the
oxford
street
end
well
watson
it
as
well
we
have
not
to
turn
out
to
night
said
holmes
laying
aside
his
lens
and
rolling
up
the
palimpsest
ve
done
enough
for
one
sitting
it
is
trying
work
for
the
eyes
so
far
as
can
make
out
it
is
nothing
more
exciting
than
an
abbey
accounts
dating
from
the
second
half
of
the
fifteenth
century
halloa
what
this
amid
the
droning
of
the
wind
there
had
come
the
stamping
of
horse
hoofs
and
the
long
grind
of
wheel
as
it
rasped
against
the
kerb
the
cab
which
had
seen
had
pulled
up
at
our
door
what
can
he
want
ejaculated
as
man
stepped
out
of
it
want
he
wants
us
and
we
my
poor
watson
want
overcoats
and
cravats
and
goloshes
and
every
aid
that
man
ever
invented
to
fight
the
weather
wait
bit
though
there
the
cab
off
again
there
hope
yet
he
have
kept
it
if
he
had
wanted
us
to
come
run
down
my
dear
fellow
and
open
the
door
for
all
virtuous
folk
have
been
long
in
bed
when
the
light
of
the
hall
lamp
fell
upon
our
midnight
visitor
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
him
it
was
young
stanley
hopkins
promising
detective
in
whose
career
holmes
had
several
times
shown
very
practical
interest
is
he
in
he
asked
eagerly
come
up
my
dear
sir
said
holmes
voice
from
above
hope
you
have
no
designs
upon
us
on
such
night
as
this
the
detective
mounted
the
stairs
and
our
lamp
gleamed
upon
his
shining
waterproof
helped
him
out
of
it
while
holmes
knocked
blaze
out
of
the
logs
in
the
grate
now
my
dear
hopkins
draw
up
and
warm
your
toes
said
he
here
cigar
and
the
doctor
has
prescription
containing
hot
water
and
lemon
which
is
good
medicine
on
night
like
this
it
must
be
something
important
which
has
brought
you
out
in
such
gale
it
is
indeed
mr
holmes
ve
had
bustling
afternoon
promise
you
did
you
see
anything
of
the
yoxley
case
in
the
latest
editions
ve
seen
nothing
later
than
the
fifteenth
century
to
day
well
it
was
only
paragraph
and
all
wrong
at
that
so
you
have
not
missed
anything
haven
let
the
grass
grow
under
my
feet
it
down
in
kent
seven
miles
from
chatham
and
three
from
the
railway
line
was
wired
for
at
three
fifteen
reached
yoxley
old
place
at
five
conducted
my
investigation
was
back
at
charing
cross
by
the
last
train
and
straight
to
you
by
cab
which
means
suppose
that
you
are
not
quite
clear
about
your
case
it
means
that
can
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
it
so
far
as
can
see
it
is
just
as
tangled
business
as
ever
handled
and
yet
at
first
it
seemed
so
simple
that
one
couldn
go
wrong
there
no
motive
mr
holmes
that
what
bothers
me
can
put
my
hand
on
motive
here
man
dead
there
no
denying
that
but
so
far
as
can
see
no
reason
on
earth
why
anyone
should
wish
him
harm
holmes
lit
his
cigar
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
let
us
hear
about
it
said
he
ve
got
my
facts
pretty
clear
said
stanley
hopkins
all
want
now
is
to
know
what
they
all
mean
the
story
so
far
as
can
make
it
out
is
like
this
some
years
ago
this
country
house
yoxley
old
place
was
taken
by
an
elderly
man
who
gave
the
name
of
professor
coram
he
was
an
invalid
keeping
his
bed
half
the
time
and
the
other
half
hobbling
round
the
house
with
stick
or
being
pushed
about
the
grounds
by
the
gardener
in
bath
chair
he
was
well
liked
by
the
few
neighbours
who
called
upon
him
and
he
has
the
reputation
down
there
of
being
very
learned
man
his
household
used
to
consist
of
an
elderly
housekeeper
mrs
marker
and
of
maid
susan
tarlton
these
have
both
been
with
him
since
his
arrival
and
they
seem
to
be
women
of
excellent
character
the
professor
is
writing
learned
book
and
he
found
it
necessary
about
year
ago
to
engage
secretary
the
first
two
that
he
tried
were
not
successes
but
the
third
mr
willoughby
smith
very
young
man
straight
from
the
university
seems
to
have
been
just
what
his
employer
wanted
his
work
consisted
in
writing
all
the
morning
to
the
professor
dictation
and
he
usually
spent
the
evening
in
hunting
up
references
and
passages
which
bore
upon
the
next
day
work
this
willoughby
smith
has
nothing
against
him
either
as
boy
at
uppingham
or
as
young
man
at
cambridge
have
seen
his
testimonials
and
from
the
first
he
was
decent
quiet
hardworking
fellow
with
no
weak
spot
in
him
at
all
and
yet
this
is
the
lad
who
has
met
his
death
this
morning
in
the
professor
study
under
circumstances
which
can
point
only
to
murder
the
wind
howled
and
screamed
at
the
windows
holmes
and
drew
closer
to
the
fire
while
the
young
inspector
slowly
and
point
by
point
developed
his
singular
narrative
if
you
were
to
search
all
england
said
he
don
suppose
you
could
find
household
more
self
contained
or
free
from
outside
influences
whole
weeks
would
pass
and
not
one
of
them
go
past
the
garden
gate
the
professor
was
buried
in
his
work
and
existed
for
nothing
else
young
smith
knew
nobody
in
the
neighbourhood
and
lived
very
much
as
his
employer
did
the
two
women
had
nothing
to
take
them
from
the
house
mortimer
the
gardener
who
wheels
the
bath
chair
is
an
army
pensioner
an
old
crimean
man
of
excellent
character
he
does
not
live
in
the
house
but
in
three
roomed
cottage
at
the
other
end
of
the
garden
those
are
the
only
people
that
you
would
find
within
the
grounds
of
yoxley
old
place
at
the
same
time
the
gate
of
the
garden
is
hundred
yards
from
the
main
london
to
chatham
road
it
opens
with
latch
and
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
anyone
from
walking
in
now
will
give
you
the
evidence
of
susan
tarlton
who
is
the
only
person
who
can
say
anything
positive
about
the
matter
it
was
in
the
forenoon
between
eleven
and
twelve
she
was
engaged
at
the
moment
in
hanging
some
curtains
in
the
upstairs
front
bedroom
professor
coram
was
still
in
bed
for
when
the
weather
is
bad
he
seldom
rises
before
midday
the
housekeeper
was
busied
with
some
work
in
the
back
of
the
house
willoughby
smith
had
been
in
his
bedroom
which
he
uses
as
sitting
room
but
the
maid
heard
him
at
that
moment
pass
along
the
passage
and
descend
to
the
study
immediately
below
her
she
did
not
see
him
but
she
says
that
she
could
not
be
mistaken
in
his
quick
firm
tread
she
did
not
hear
the
study
door
close
but
minute
or
so
later
there
was
dreadful
cry
in
the
room
below
it
was
wild
hoarse
scream
so
strange
and
unnatural
that
it
might
have
come
either
from
man
or
woman
at
the
same
instant
there
was
heavy
thud
which
shook
the
old
house
and
then
all
was
silence
the
maid
stood
petrified
for
moment
and
then
recovering
her
courage
she
ran
downstairs
the
study
door
was
shut
and
she
opened
it
inside
young
mr
willoughby
smith
was
stretched
upon
the
floor
at
first
she
could
see
no
injury
but
as
she
tried
to
raise
him
she
saw
that
blood
was
pouring
from
the
underside
of
his
neck
it
was
pierced
by
very
small
but
very
deep
wound
which
had
divided
the
carotid
artery
the
instrument
with
which
the
injury
had
been
inflicted
lay
upon
the
carpet
beside
him
it
was
one
of
those
small
sealing
wax
knives
to
be
found
on
old
fashioned
writing
tables
with
an
ivory
handle
and
stiff
blade
it
was
part
of
the
fittings
of
the
professor
own
desk

at
first
the
maid
thought
that
young
smith
was
already
dead
but
on
pouring
some
water
from
the
carafe
over
his
forehead
he
opened
his
eyes
for
an
instant
the
professor
he
murmured
it
was
she
the
maid
is
prepared
to
swear
that
those
were
the
exact
words
he
tried
desperately
to
say
something
else
and
he
held
his
right
hand
up
in
the
air
then
he
fell
back
dead
in
the
meantime
the
housekeeper
had
also
arrived
upon
the
scene
but
she
was
just
too
late
to
catch
the
young
man
dying
words
leaving
susan
with
the
body
she
hurried
to
the
professor
room
he
was
sitting
up
in
bed
horribly
agitated
for
he
had
heard
enough
to
convince
him
that
something
terrible
had
occurred
mrs
marker
is
prepared
to
swear
that
the
professor
was
still
in
his
night
clothes
and
indeed
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
dress
without
the
help
of
mortimer
whose
orders
were
to
come
at
twelve
clock
the
professor
declares
that
he
heard
the
distant
cry
but
that
he
knows
nothing
more
he
can
give
no
explanation
of
the
young
man
last
words
the
professor
it
was
she
but
imagines
that
they
were
the
outcome
of
delirium
he
believes
that
willoughby
smith
had
not
an
enemy
in
the
world
and
can
give
no
reason
for
the
crime
his
first
action
was
to
send
mortimer
the
gardener
for
the
local
police
little
later
the
chief
constable
sent
for
me
nothing
was
moved
before
got
there
and
strict
orders
were
given
that
no
one
should
walk
upon
the
paths
leading
to
the
house
it
was
splendid
chance
of
putting
your
theories
into
practice
mr
sherlock
holmes
there
was
really
nothing
wanting
except
mr
sherlock
holmes
said
my
companion
with
somewhat
bitter
smile
well
let
us
hear
about
it
what
sort
of
job
did
you
make
of
it
must
ask
you
first
mr
holmes
to
glance
at
this
rough
plan
which
will
give
you
general
idea
of
the
position
of
the
professor
study
and
the
various
points
of
the
case
it
will
help
you
in
following
my
investigation
he
unfolded
the
rough
chart
which
here
reproduce
and
he
laid
it
across
holmes
knee
rose
and
standing
behind
holmes
studied
it
over
his
shoulder
it
is
very
rough
of
course
and
it
only
deals
with
the
points
which
seem
to
me
to
be
essential
all
the
rest
you
will
see
later
for
yourself
now
first
of
all
presuming
that
the
assassin
entered
the
house
how
did
he
or
she
come
in
undoubtedly
by
the
garden
path
and
the
back
door
from
which
there
is
direct
access
to
the
study
any
other
way
would
have
been
exceedingly
complicated
the
escape
must
have
also
been
made
along
that
line
for
of
the
two
other
exits
from
the
room
one
was
blocked
by
susan
as
she
ran
downstairs
and
the
other
leads
straight
to
the
professor
bedroom
therefore
directed
my
attention
at
once
to
the
garden
path
which
was
saturated
with
recent
rain
and
would
certainly
show
any
footmarks
my
examination
showed
me
that
was
dealing
with
cautious
and
expert
criminal
no
footmarks
were
to
be
found
on
the
path
there
could
be
no
question
however
that
someone
had
passed
along
the
grass
border
which
lines
the
path
and
that
he
had
done
so
in
order
to
avoid
leaving
track
could
not
find
anything
in
the
nature
of
distinct
impression
but
the
grass
was
trodden
down
and
someone
had
undoubtedly
passed
it
could
only
have
been
the
murderer
since
neither
the
gardener
nor
anyone
else
had
been
there
that
morning
and
the
rain
had
only
begun
during
the
night
one
moment
said
holmes
where
does
this
path
lead
to
the
road
how
long
is
it
hundred
yards
or
so
at
the
point
where
the
path
passes
through
the
gate
you
could
surely
pick
up
the
tracks
unfortunately
the
path
was
tiled
at
that
point
well
on
the
road
itself
no
it
was
all
trodden
into
mire
tut
well
then
these
tracks
upon
the
grass
were
they
coming
or
going
it
was
impossible
to
say
there
was
never
any
outline
large
foot
or
small
you
could
not
distinguish
holmes
gave
an
ejaculation
of
impatience
it
has
been
pouring
rain
and
blowing
hurricane
ever
since
said
he
it
will
be
harder
to
read
now
than
that
palimpsest
well
it
can
be
helped
what
did
you
do
hopkins
after
you
had
made
certain
that
you
had
made
certain
of
nothing
think
made
certain
of
good
deal
mr
holmes
knew
that
someone
had
entered
the
house
cautiously
from
without
next
examined
the
corridor
it
is
lined
with
cocoanut
matting
and
had
taken
no
impression
of
any
kind
this
brought
me
into
the
study
itself
it
is
scantily
furnished
room
the
main
article
is
large
writing
table
with
fixed
bureau
this
bureau
consists
of
double
column
of
drawers
with
central
small
cupboard
between
them
the
drawers
were
open
the
cupboard
locked
the
drawers
it
seems
were
always
open
and
nothing
of
value
was
kept
in
them
there
were
some
papers
of
importance
in
the
cupboard
but
there
were
no
signs
that
this
had
been
tampered
with
and
the
professor
assures
me
that
nothing
was
missing
it
is
certain
that
no
robbery
has
been
committed
come
now
to
the
body
of
the
young
man
it
was
found
near
the
bureau
and
just
to
the
left
of
it
as
marked
upon
that
chart
the
stab
was
on
the
right
side
of
the
neck
and
from
behind
forwards
so
that
it
is
almost
impossible
that
it
could
have
been
self
inflicted
unless
he
fell
upon
the
knife
said
holmes
exactly
the
idea
crossed
my
mind
but
we
found
the
knife
some
feet
away
from
the
body
so
that
seems
impossible
then
of
course
there
are
the
man
own
dying
words
and
finally
there
was
this
very
important
piece
of
evidence
which
was
found
clasped
in
the
dead
man
right
hand
from
his
pocket
stanley
hopkins
drew
small
paper
packet
he
unfolded
it
and
disclosed
golden
pince
nez
with
two
broken
ends
of
black
silk
cord
dangling
from
the
end
of
it
willoughby
smith
had
excellent
sight
he
added
there
can
be
no
question
that
this
was
snatched
from
the
face
or
the
person
of
the
assassin
sherlock
holmes
took
the
glasses
into
his
hand
and
examined
them
with
the
utmost
attention
and
interest
he
held
them
on
his
nose
endeavoured
to
read
through
them
went
to
the
window
and
stared
up
the
street
with
them
looked
at
them
most
minutely
in
the
full
light
of
the
lamp
and
finally
with
chuckle
seated
himself
at
the
table
and
wrote
few
lines
upon
sheet
of
paper
which
he
tossed
across
to
stanley
hopkins
that
the
best
can
do
for
you
said
he
it
may
prove
to
be
of
some
use
the
astonished
detective
read
the
note
aloud
it
ran
as
follows
wanted
woman
of
good
address
attired
like
lady
she
has
remarkably
thick
nose
with
eyes
which
are
set
close
upon
either
side
of
it
she
has
puckered
forehead
peering
expression
and
probably
rounded
shoulders
there
are
indications
that
she
has
had
recourse
to
an
optician
at
least
twice
during
the
last
few
months
as
her
glasses
are
of
remarkable
strength
and
as
opticians
are
not
very
numerous
there
should
be
no
difficulty
in
tracing
her
holmes
smiled
at
the
astonishment
of
hopkins
which
must
have
been
reflected
upon
my
features
surely
my
deductions
are
simplicity
itself
said
he
it
would
be
difficult
to
name
any
articles
which
afford
finer
field
for
inference
than
pair
of
glasses
especially
so
remarkable
pair
as
these
that
they
belong
to
woman
infer
from
their
delicacy
and
also
of
course
from
the
last
words
of
the
dying
man
as
to
her
being
person
of
refinement
and
well
dressed
they
are
as
you
perceive
handsomely
mounted
in
solid
gold
and
it
is
inconceivable
that
anyone
who
wore
such
glasses
could
be
slatternly
in
other
respects
you
will
find
that
the
clips
are
too
wide
for
your
nose
showing
that
the
lady
nose
was
very
broad
at
the
base
this
sort
of
nose
is
usually
short
and
coarse
one
but
there
are
sufficient
number
of
exceptions
to
prevent
me
from
being
dogmatic
or
from
insisting
upon
this
point
in
my
description
my
own
face
is
narrow
one
and
yet
find
that
cannot
get
my
eyes
into
the
centre
or
near
the
centre
of
these
glasses
therefore
the
lady
eyes
are
set
very
near
to
the
sides
of
the
nose
you
will
perceive
watson
that
the
glasses
are
concave
and
of
unusual
strength
lady
whose
vision
has
been
so
extremely
contracted
all
her
life
is
sure
to
have
the
physical
characteristics
of
such
vision
which
are
seen
in
the
forehead
the
eyelids
and
the
shoulders
yes
said
can
follow
each
of
your
arguments
confess
however
that
am
unable
to
understand
how
you
arrive
at
the
double
visit
to
the
optician
holmes
took
the
glasses
in
his
hand
you
will
perceive
he
said
that
the
clips
are
lined
with
tiny
bands
of
cork
to
soften
the
pressure
upon
the
nose
one
of
these
is
discoloured
and
worn
to
some
slight
extent
but
the
other
is
new
evidently
one
has
fallen
off
and
been
replaced
should
judge
that
the
older
of
them
has
not
been
there
more
than
few
months
they
exactly
correspond
so
gather
that
the
lady
went
back
to
the
same
establishment
for
the
second

it
marvellous
cried
hopkins
in
an
ecstasy
of
admiration
to
think
that
had
all
that
evidence
in
my
hand
and
never
knew
it
had
intended
however
to
go
the
round
of
the
london
opticians
of
course
you
would
meanwhile
have
you
anything
more
to
tell
us
about
the
case
nothing
mr
holmes
think
that
you
know
as
much
as
do
now
probably
more
we
have
had
inquiries
made
as
to
any
stranger
seen
on
the
country
roads
or
at
the
railway
station
we
have
heard
of
none
what
beats
me
is
the
utter
want
of
all
object
in
the
crime
not
ghost
of
motive
can
anyone
suggest
ah
there
am
not
in
position
to
help
you
but
suppose
you
want
us
to
come
out
to
morrow
if
it
is
not
asking
too
much
mr
holmes
there
train
from
charing
cross
to
chatham
at
six
in
the
morning
and
we
should
be
at
yoxley
old
place
between
eight
and
nine
then
we
shall
take
it
your
case
has
certainly
some
features
of
great
interest
and
shall
be
delighted
to
look
into
it
well
it
nearly
one
and
we
had
best
get
few
hours
sleep
dare
say
you
can
manage
all
right
on
the
sofa
in
front
of
the
fire
ll
light
my
spirit
lamp
and
give
you
cup
of
coffee
before
we
start
the
gale
had
blown
itself
out
next
day
but
it
was
bitter
morning
when
we
started
upon
our
journey
we
saw
the
cold
winter
sun
rise
over
the
dreary
marshes
of
the
thames
and
the
long
sullen
reaches
of
the
river
which
shall
ever
associate
with
our
pursuit
of
the
andaman
islander
in
the
earlier
days
of
our
career
after
long
and
weary
journey
we
alighted
at
small
station
some
miles
from
chatham
while
horse
was
being
put
into
trap
at
the
local
inn
we
snatched
hurried
breakfast
and
so
we
were
all
ready
for
business
when
we
at
last
arrived
at
yoxley
old
place
constable
met
us
at
the
garden
gate
well
wilson
any
news
no
sir
nothing
no
reports
of
any
stranger
seen
no
sir
down
at
the
station
they
are
certain
that
no
stranger
either
came
or
went
yesterday
have
you
had
inquiries
made
at
inns
and
lodgings
yes
sir
there
is
no
one
that
we
cannot
account
for
well
it
only
reasonable
walk
to
chatham
anyone
might
stay
there
or
take
train
without
being
observed
this
is
the
garden
path
of
which
spoke
mr
holmes
ll
pledge
my
word
there
was
no
mark
on
it
yesterday
on
which
side
were
the
marks
on
the
grass
this
side
sir
this
narrow
margin
of
grass
between
the
path
and
the
flower
bed
can
see
the
traces
now
but
they
were
clear
to
me
then
yes
someone
has
passed
along
said
holmes
stooping
over
the
grass
border
our
lady
must
have
picked
her
steps
carefully
must
she
not
since
on
the
one
side
she
would
leave
track
on
the
path
and
on
the
other
an
even
clearer
one
on
the
soft
bed
yes
sir
she
must
have
been
cool
hand
saw
an
intent
look
pass
over
holmes
face
you
say
that
she
must
have
come
back
this
way
yes
sir
there
is
no
other
on
this
strip
of
grass
certainly
mr
holmes
hum
it
was
very
remarkable
performance
very
remarkable
well
think
we
have
exhausted
the
path
let
us
go
farther
this
garden
door
is
usually
kept
open
suppose
then
this
visitor
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
walk
in
the
idea
of
murder
was
not
in
her
mind
or
she
would
have
provided
herself
with
some
sort
of
weapon
instead
of
having
to
pick
this
knife
off
the
writing
table
she
advanced
along
this
corridor
leaving
no
traces
upon
the
cocoanut
matting
then
she
found
herself
in
this
study
how
long
was
she
there
we
have
no
means
of
judging
not
more
than
few
minutes
sir
forgot
to
tell
you
that
mrs
marker
the
housekeeper
had
been
in
there
tidying
not
very
long
before
about
quarter
of
an
hour
she
says
well
that
gives
us
limit
our
lady
enters
this
room
and
what
does
she
do
she
goes
over
to
the
writing
table
what
for
not
for
anything
in
the
drawers
if
there
had
been
anything
worth
her
taking
it
would
surely
have
been
locked
up
no
it
was
for
something
in
that
wooden
bureau
halloa
what
is
that
scratch
upon
the
face
of
it
just
hold
match
watson
why
did
you
not
tell
me
of
this
hopkins
the
mark
which
he
was
examining
began
upon
the
brass
work
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
keyhole
and
extended
for
about
four
inches
where
it
had
scratched
the
varnish
from
the
surface
noticed
it
mr
holmes
but
you
ll
always
find
scratches
round
keyhole
this
is
recent
quite
recent
see
how
the
brass
shines
where
it
is
cut
an
old
scratch
would
be
the
same
colour
as
the
surface
look
at
it
through
my
lens
there
the
varnish
too
like
earth
on
each
side
of
furrow
is
mrs
marker
there
sad
faced
elderly
woman
came
into
the
room
did
you
dust
this
bureau
yesterday
morning
yes
sir
did
you
notice
this
scratch
no
sir
did
not
am
sure
you
did
not
for
duster
would
have
swept
away
these
shreds
of
varnish
who
has
the
key
of
this
bureau
the
professor
keeps
it
on
his
watch
chain
is
it
simple
key
no
sir
it
is
chubb
key
very
good
mrs
marker
you
can
go
now
we
are
making
little
progress
our
lady
enters
the
room
advances
to
the
bureau
and
either
opens
it
or
tries
to
do
so
while
she
is
thus
engaged
young
willoughby
smith
enters
the
room
in
her
hurry
to
withdraw
the
key
she
makes
this
scratch
upon
the
door
he
seizes
her
and
she
snatching
up
the
nearest
object
which
happens
to
be
this
knife
strikes
at
him
in
order
to
make
him
let
go
his
hold
the
blow
is
fatal
one
he
falls
and
she
escapes
either
with
or
without
the
object
for
which
she
has
come
is
susan
the
maid
there
could
anyone
have
got
away
through
that
door
after
the
time
that
you
heard
the
cry
susan
no
sir
it
is
impossible
before
got
down
the
stair
have
seen
anyone
in
the
passage
besides
the
door
never
opened
for
would
have
heard
it
that
settles
this
exit
then
no
doubt
the
lady
went
out
the
way
she
came
understand
that
this
other
passage
leads
only
to
the
professor
room
there
is
no
exit
that
way
no
sir
we
shall
go
down
it
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
professor
halloa
hopkins
this
is
very
important
very
important
indeed
the
professor
corridor
is
also
lined
with
cocoanut
matting
well
sir
what
of
that
don
you
see
any
bearing
upon
the
case
well
don
insist
upon
it
no
doubt
am
wrong
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
to
be
suggestive
come
with
me
and
introduce
me
we
passed
down
the
passage
which
was
of
the
same
length
as
that
which
led
to
the
garden
at
the
end
was
short
flight
of
steps
ending
in
door
our
guide
knocked
and
then
ushered
us
into
the
professor
bedroom
it
was
very
large
chamber
lined
with
innumerable
volumes
which
had
overflowed
from
the
shelves
and
lay
in
piles
in
the
corners
or
were
stacked
all
round
at
the
base
of
the
cases
the
bed
was
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
in
it
propped
up
with
pillows
was
the
owner
of
the
house
have
seldom
seen
more
remarkable
looking
person
it
was
gaunt
aquiline
face
which
was
turned
towards
us
with
piercing
dark
eyes
which
lurked
in
deep
hollows
under
overhung
and
tufted
brows
his
hair
and
beard
were
white
save
that
the
latter
was
curiously
stained
with
yellow
around
his
mouth
cigarette
glowed
amid
the
tangle
of
white
hair
and
the
air
of
the
room
was
fetid
with
stale
tobacco
smoke
as
he
held
out
his
hand
to
holmes
perceived
that
it
also
was
stained
yellow
with
nicotine
smoker
mr
holmes
said
he
speaking
well
chosen
english
with
curious
little
mincing
accent
pray
take
cigarette
and
you
sir
can
recommend
them
for
have
them
especially
prepared
by
ionides
of
alexandria
he
sends
me
thousand
at
time
and
grieve
to
say
that
have
to
arrange
for
fresh
supply
every
fortnight
bad
sir
very
bad
but
an
old
man
has
few
pleasures
tobacco
and
my
work
that
is
all
that
is
left
to
me
holmes
had
lit
cigarette
and
was
shooting
little
darting
glances
all
over
the
room
tobacco
and
my
work
but
now
only
tobacco
the
old
man
exclaimed
alas
what
fatal
interruption
who
could
have
foreseen
such
terrible
catastrophe
so
estimable
young
man
assure
you
that
after
few
months
training
he
was
an
admirable
assistant
what
do
you
think
of
the
matter
mr
holmes
have
not
yet
made
up
my
mind
shall
indeed
be
indebted
to
you
if
you
can
throw
light
where
all
is
so
dark
to
us
to
poor
bookworm
and
invalid
like
myself
such
blow
is
paralyzing
seem
to
have
lost
the
faculty
of
thought
but
you
are
man
of
action
you
are
man
of
affairs
it
is
part
of
the
everyday
routine
of
your
life
you
can
preserve
your
balance
in
every
emergency
we
are
fortunate
indeed
in
having
you
at
our
side
holmes
was
pacing
up
and
down
one
side
of
the
room
whilst
the
old
professor
was
talking
observed
that
he
was
smoking
with
extraordinary
rapidity
it
was
evident
that
he
shared
our
host
liking
for
the
fresh
alexandrian
cigarettes

yes
sir
it
is
crushing
blow
said
the
old
man
that
is
my
magnum
opus
the
pile
of
papers
on
the
side
table
yonder
it
is
my
analysis
of
the
documents
found
in
the
coptic
monasteries
of
syria
and
egypt
work
which
will
cut
deep
at
the
very
foundations
of
revealed
religion
with
my
enfeebled
health
do
not
know
whether
shall
ever
be
able
to
complete
it
now
that
my
assistant
has
been
taken
from
me
dear
me
mr
holmes
why
you
are
even
quicker
smoker
than
am
myself
holmes
smiled
am
connoisseur
said
he
taking
another
cigarette
from
the
box
his
fourth
and
lighting
it
from
the
stub
of
that
which
he
had
finished
will
not
trouble
you
with
any
lengthy
cross
examination
professor
coram
since
gather
that
you
were
in
bed
at
the
time
of
the
crime
and
could
know
nothing
about
it
would
only
ask
this
what
do
you
imagine
that
this
poor
fellow
meant
by
his
last
words
the
professor
it
was
she
the
professor
shook
his
head
susan
is
country
girl
said
he
and
you
know
the
incredible
stupidity
of
that
class
fancy
that
the
poor
fellow
murmured
some
incoherent
delirious
words
and
that
she
twisted
them
into
this
meaningless
message
see
you
have
no
explanation
yourself
of
the
tragedy
possibly
an
accident
possibly
only
breathe
it
among
ourselves
suicide
young
men
have
their
hidden
troubles
some
affair
of
the
heart
perhaps
which
we
have
never
known
it
is
more
probable
supposition
than
murder
but
the
eye
glasses
ah
am
only
student
man
of
dreams
cannot
explain
the
practical
things
of
life
but
still
we
are
aware
my
friend
that
love
gages
may
take
strange
shapes
by
all
means
take
another
cigarette
it
is
pleasure
to
see
anyone
appreciate
them
so
fan
glove
glasses
who
knows
what
article
may
be
carried
as
token
or
treasured
when
man
puts
an
end
to
his
life
this
gentleman
speaks
of
footsteps
in
the
grass
but
after
all
it
is
easy
to
be
mistaken
on
such
point
as
to
the
knife
it
might
well
be
thrown
far
from
the
unfortunate
man
as
he
fell
it
is
possible
that
speak
as
child
but
to
me
it
seems
that
willoughby
smith
has
met
his
fate
by
his
own
hand
holmes
seemed
struck
by
the
theory
thus
put
forward
and
he
continued
to
walk
up
and
down
for
some
time
lost
in
thought
and
consuming
cigarette
after
cigarette
tell
me
professor
coram
he
said
at
last
what
is
in
that
cupboard
in
the
bureau
nothing
that
would
help
thief
family
papers
letters
from
my
poor
wife
diplomas
of
universities
which
have
done
me
honour
here
is
the
key
you
can
look
for
yourself
holmes
picked
up
the
key
and
looked
at
it
for
an
instant
then
he
handed
it
back
no
hardly
think
that
it
would
help
me
said
he
should
prefer
to
go
quietly
down
to
your
garden
and
turn
the
whole
matter
over
in
my
head
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
the
theory
of
suicide
which
you
have
put
forward
we
must
apologize
for
having
intruded
upon
you
professor
coram
and
promise
that
we
won
disturb
you
until
after
lunch
at
two
clock
we
will
come
again
and
report
to
you
anything
which
may
have
happened
in
the
interval
holmes
was
curiously
distrait
and
we
walked
up
and
down
the
garden
path
for
some
time
in
silence
have
you
clue
asked
at
last
it
depends
upon
those
cigarettes
that
smoked
said
he
it
is
possible
that
am
utterly
mistaken
the
cigarettes
will
show
me
my
dear
holmes
exclaimed
how
on
earth
well
you
may
see
for
yourself
if
not
there
no
harm
done
of
course
we
always
have
the
optician
clue
to
fall
back
upon
but
take
short
cut
when
can
get
it
ah
here
is
the
good
mrs
marker
let
us
enjoy
five
minutes
of
instructive
conversation
with
her
may
have
remarked
before
that
holmes
had
when
he
liked
peculiarly
ingratiating
way
with
women
and
that
he
very
readily
established
terms
of
confidence
with
them
in
half
the
time
which
he
had
named
he
had
captured
the
housekeeper
goodwill
and
was
chatting
with
her
as
if
he
had
known
her
for
years
yes
mr
holmes
it
is
as
you
say
sir
he
does
smoke
something
terrible
all
day
and
sometimes
all
night
sir
ve
seen
that
room
of
morning
well
sir
you
have
thought
it
was
london
fog
poor
young
mr
smith
he
was
smoker
also
but
not
as
bad
as
the
professor
his
health
well
don
know
that
it
better
nor
worse
for
the
smoking
ah
said
holmes
but
it
kills
the
appetite
well
don
know
about
that
sir
suppose
the
professor
eats
hardly
anything
well
he
is
variable
ll
say
that
for
him
ll
wager
he
took
no
breakfast
this
morning
and
won
face
his
lunch
after
all
the
cigarettes
saw
him
consume
well
you
re
out
there
sir
as
it
happens
for
he
ate
remarkable
big
breakfast
this
morning
don
know
when
ve
known
him
make
better
one
and
he
ordered
good
dish
of
cutlets
for
his
lunch
surprised
myself
for
since
came
into
that
room
yesterday
and
saw
young
mr
smith
lying
there
on
the
floor
couldn
bear
to
look
at
food
well
it
takes
all
sorts
to
make
world
and
the
professor
hasn
let
it
take
his
appetite
away
we
loitered
the
morning
away
in
the
garden
stanley
hopkins
had
gone
down
to
the
village
to
look
into
some
rumours
of
strange
woman
who
had
been
seen
by
some
children
on
the
chatham
road
the
previous
morning
as
to
my
friend
all
his
usual
energy
seemed
to
have
deserted
him
had
never
known
him
handle
case
in
such
half
hearted
fashion
even
the
news
brought
back
by
hopkins
that
he
had
found
the
children
and
that
they
had
undoubtedly
seen
woman
exactly
corresponding
with
holmes
description
and
wearing
either
spectacles
or
eye
glasses
failed
to
rouse
any
sign
of
keen
interest
he
was
more
attentive
when
susan
who
waited
upon
us
at
lunch
volunteered
the
information
that
she
believed
mr
smith
had
been
out
for
walk
yesterday
morning
and
that
he
had
only
returned
half
an
hour
before
the
tragedy
occurred
could
not
myself
see
the
bearing
of
this
incident
but
clearly
perceived
that
holmes
was
weaving
it
into
the
general
scheme
which
he
had
formed
in
his
brain
suddenly
he
sprang
from
his
chair
and
glanced
at
his
watch
two
clock
gentlemen
said
he
we
must
go
up
and
have
it
out
with
our
friend
the
professor
the
old
man
had
just
finished
his
lunch
and
certainly
his
empty
dish
bore
evidence
to
the
good
appetite
with
which
his
housekeeper
had
credited
him
he
was
indeed
weird
figure
as
he
turned
his
white
mane
and
his
glowing
eyes
towards
us
the
eternal
cigarette
smouldered
in
his
mouth
he
had
been
dressed
and
was
seated
in
an
arm
chair
by
the
fire
well
mr
holmes
have
you
solved
this
mystery
yet
he
shoved
the
large
tin
of
cigarettes
which
stood
on
table
beside
him
towards
my
companion
holmes
stretched
out
his
hand
at
the
same
moment
and
between
them
they
tipped
the
box
over
the
edge
for
minute
or
two
we
were
all
on
our
knees
retrieving
stray
cigarettes
from
impossible
places
when
we
rose
again
observed
that
holmes
eyes
were
shining
and
his
cheeks
tinged
with
colour
only
at
crisis
have
seen
those
battle
signals
flying
yes
said
he
have
solved
it
stanley
hopkins
and
stared
in
amazement
something
like
sneer
quivered
over
the
gaunt
features
of
the
old
professor
indeed
in
the
garden
no
here
when
this
instant
you
are
surely
joking
mr
sherlock
holmes
you
compel
me
to
tell
you
that
this
is
too
serious
matter
to
be
treated
in
such
fashion
have
forged
and
tested
every
link
of
my
chain
professor
coram
and
am
sure
that
it
is
sound
what
your
motives
are
or
what
exact
part
you
play
in
this
strange
business
am
not
yet
able
to
say
in
few
minutes
shall
probably
hear
it
from
your
own
lips
meanwhile
will
reconstruct
what
is
past
for
your
benefit
so
that
you
may
know
the
information
which
still
require
lady
yesterday
entered
your
study
she
came
with
the
intention
of
possessing
herself
of
certain
documents
which
were
in
your
bureau
she
had
key
of
her
own
have
had
an
opportunity
of
examining
yours
and
do
not
find
that
slight
discolouration
which
the
scratch
made
upon
the
varnish
would
have
produced
you
were
not
an
accessory
therefore
and
she
came
so
far
as
can
read
the
evidence
without
your
knowledge
to
rob
you
the
professor
blew
cloud
from
his
lips
this
is
most
interesting
and
instructive
said
he
have
you
no
more
to
add
surely
having
traced
this
lady
so
far
you
can
also
say
what
has
become
of
her
will
endeavour
to
do
so
in
the
first
place
she
was
seized
by
your
secretary
and
stabbed
him
in
order
to
escape
this
catastrophe
am
inclined
to
regard
as
an
unhappy
accident
for
am
convinced
that
the
lady
had
no
intention
of
inflicting
so
grievous
an
injury
an
assassin
does
not
come
unarmed
horrified
by
what
she
had
done
she
rushed
wildly
away
from
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
unfortunately
for
her
she
had
lost
her
glasses
in
the
scuffle
and
as
she
was
extremely
short
sighted
she
was
really
helpless
without
them
she
ran
down
corridor
which
she
imagined
to
be
that
by
which
she
had
come
both
were
lined
with
cocoanut
matting
and
it
was
only
when
it
was
too
late
that
she
understood
that
she
had
taken
the
wrong
passage
and
that
her
retreat
was
cut
off
behind
her
what
was
she
to
do
she
could
not
go
back
she
could
not
remain
where
she
was
she
must
go
on
she
went
on
she
mounted
stair
pushed
open
door
and
found
herself
in
your
room

the
old
man
sat
with
his
mouth
open
staring
wildly
at
holmes
amazement
and
fear
were
stamped
upon
his
expressive
features
now
with
an
effort
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
burst
into
insincere
laughter
all
very
fine
mr
holmes
said
he
but
there
is
one
little
flaw
in
your
splendid
theory
was
myself
in
my
room
and
never
left
it
during
the
day
am
aware
of
that
professor
coram
and
you
mean
to
say
that
could
lie
upon
that
bed
and
not
be
aware
that
woman
had
entered
my
room
never
said
so
you
were
aware
of
it
you
spoke
with
her
you
recognised
her
you
aided
her
to
escape
again
the
professor
burst
into
high
keyed
laughter
he
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
his
eyes
glowed
like
embers
you
are
mad
he
cried
you
are
talking
insanely
helped
her
to
escape
where
is
she
now
she
is
there
said
holmes
and
he
pointed
to
high
bookcase
in
the
corner
of
the
room
saw
the
old
man
throw
up
his
arms
terrible
convulsion
passed
over
his
grim
face
and
he
fell
back
in
his
chair
at
the
same
instant
the
bookcase
at
which
holmes
pointed
swung
round
upon
hinge
and
woman
rushed
out
into
the
room
you
are
right
she
cried
in
strange
foreign
voice
you
are
right
am
here
she
was
brown
with
the
dust
and
draped
with
the
cobwebs
which
had
come
from
the
walls
of
her
hiding
place
her
face
too
was
streaked
with
grime
and
at
the
best
she
could
never
have
been
handsome
for
she
had
the
exact
physical
characteristics
which
holmes
had
divined
with
in
addition
long
and
obstinate
chin
what
with
her
natural
blindness
and
what
with
the
change
from
dark
to
light
she
stood
as
one
dazed
blinking
about
her
to
see
where
and
who
we
were
and
yet
in
spite
of
all
these
disadvantages
there
was
certain
nobility
in
the
woman
bearing
gallantry
in
the
defiant
chin
and
in
the
upraised
head
which
compelled
something
of
respect
and
admiration
stanley
hopkins
had
laid
his
hand
upon
her
arm
and
claimed
her
as
his
prisoner
but
she
waved
him
aside
gently
and
yet
with
an
overmastering
dignity
which
compelled
obedience
the
old
man
lay
back
in
his
chair
with
twitching
face
and
stared
at
her
with
brooding
eyes
yes
sir
am
your
prisoner
she
said
from
where
stood
could
hear
everything
and
know
that
you
have
learned
the
truth
confess
it
all
it
was
who
killed
the
young
man
but
you
are
right
you
who
say
it
was
an
accident
did
not
even
know
that
it
was
knife
which
held
in
my
hand
for
in
my
despair
snatched
anything
from
the
table
and
struck
at
him
to
make
him
let
me
go
it
is
the
truth
that
tell
madam
said
holmes
am
sure
that
it
is
the
truth
fear
that
you
are
far
from
well
she
had
turned
dreadful
colour
the
more
ghastly
under
the
dark
dust
streaks
upon
her
face
she
seated
herself
on
the
side
of
the
bed
then
she
resumed
have
only
little
time
here
she
said
but
would
have
you
to
know
the
whole
truth
am
this
man
wife
he
is
not
an
englishman
he
is
russian
his
name
will
not
tell
for
the
first
time
the
old
man
stirred
god
bless
you
anna
he
cried
god
bless
you
she
cast
look
of
the
deepest
disdain
in
his
direction
why
should
you
cling
so
hard
to
that
wretched
life
of
yours
sergius
said
she
it
has
done
harm
to
many
and
good
to
none
not
even
to
yourself
however
it
is
not
for
me
to
cause
the
frail
thread
to
be
snapped
before
god
time
have
enough
already
upon
my
soul
since
crossed
the
threshold
of
this
cursed
house
but
must
speak
or
shall
be
too
late
have
said
gentlemen
that
am
this
man
wife
he
was
fifty
and
foolish
girl
of
twenty
when
we
married
it
was
in
city
of
russia
university
will
not
name
the
place
god
bless
you
anna
murmured
the
old
man
again
we
were
reformers
revolutionists
nihilists
you
understand
he
and
many
more
then
there
came
time
of
trouble
police
officer
was
killed
many
were
arrested
evidence
was
wanted
and
in
order
to
save
his
own
life
and
to
earn
great
reward
my
husband
betrayed
his
own
wife
and
his
companions
yes
we
were
all
arrested
upon
his
confession
some
of
us
found
our
way
to
the
gallows
and
some
to
siberia
was
among
these
last
but
my
term
was
not
for
life
my
husband
came
to
england
with
his
ill
gotten
gains
and
has
lived
in
quiet
ever
since
knowing
well
that
if
the
brotherhood
knew
where
he
was
not
week
would
pass
before
justice
would
be
done
the
old
man
reached
out
trembling
hand
and
helped
himself
to
cigarette
am
in
your
hands
anna
said
he
you
were
always
good
to
me
have
not
yet
told
you
the
height
of
his
villainy
said
she
among
our
comrades
of
the
order
there
was
one
who
was
the
friend
of
my
heart
he
was
noble
unselfish
loving
all
that
my
husband
was
not
he
hated
violence
we
were
all
guilty
if
that
is
guilt
but
he
was
not
he
wrote
for
ever
dissuading
us
from
such
course
these
letters
would
have
saved
him
so
would
my
diary
in
which
from
day
to
day
had
entered
both
my
feelings
towards
him
and
the
view
which
each
of
us
had
taken
my
husband
found
and
kept
both
diary
and
letters
he
hid
them
and
he
tried
hard
to
swear
away
the
young
man
life
in
this
he
failed
but
alexis
was
sent
convict
to
siberia
where
now
at
this
moment
he
works
in
salt
mine
think
of
that
you
villain
you
villain
now
at
this
very
moment
alexis
man
whose
name
you
are
not
worthy
to
speak
works
and
lives
like
slave
and
yet
have
your
life
in
my
hands
and
let
you
go
you
were
always
noble
woman
anna
said
the
old
man
puffing
at
his
cigarette
she
had
risen
but
she
fell
back
again
with
little
cry
of
pain
must
finish
she
said
when
my
term
was
over
set
myself
to
get
the
diary
and
letters
which
if
sent
to
the
russian
government
would
procure
my
friend
release
knew
that
my
husband
had
come
to
england
after
months
of
searching
discovered
where
he
was
knew
that
he
still
had
the
diary
for
when
was
in
siberia
had
letter
from
him
once
reproaching
me
and
quoting
some
passages
from
its
pages
yet
was
sure
that
with
his
revengeful
nature
he
would
never
give
it
to
me
of
his
own
free
will
must
get
it
for
myself
with
this
object
engaged
an
agent
from
private
detective
firm
who
entered
my
husband
house
as
secretary
it
was
your
second
secretary
sergius
the
one
who
left
you
so
hurriedly
he
found
that
papers
were
kept
in
the
cupboard
and
he
got
an
impression
of
the
key
he
would
not
go
farther
he
furnished
me
with
plan
of
the
house
and
he
told
me
that
in
the
forenoon
the
study
was
always
empty
as
the
secretary
was
employed
up
here
so
at
last
took
my
courage
in
both
hands
and
came
down
to
get
the
papers
for
myself
succeeded
but
at
what
cost
had
just
taken
the
papers
and
was
locking
the
cupboard
when
the
young
man
seized
me
had
seen
him
already
that
morning
he
had
met
me
in
the
road
and
had
asked
him
to
tell
me
where
professor
coram
lived
not
knowing
that
he
was
in
his
employ
exactly
said
holmes
the
secretary
came
back
and
told
his
employer
of
the
woman
he
had
met
then
in
his
last
breath
he
tried
to
send
message
that
it
was
she
the
she
whom
he
had
just
discussed
with
him
you
must
let
me
speak
said
the
woman
in
an
imperative
voice
and
her
face
contracted
as
if
in
pain
when
he
had
fallen
rushed
from
the
room
chose
the
wrong
door
and
found
myself
in
my
husband
room
he
spoke
of
giving
me
up
showed
him
that
if
he
did
so
his
life
was
in
my
hands
if
he
gave
me
to
the
law
could
give
him
to
the
brotherhood
it
was
not
that
wished
to
live
for
my
own
sake
but
it
was
that
desired
to
accomplish
my
purpose
he
knew
that
would
do
what
said
that
his
own
fate
was
involved
in
mine
for
that
reason
and
for
no
other
he
shielded
me
he
thrust
me
into
that
dark
hiding
place
relic
of
old
days
known
only
to
himself
he
took
his
meals
in
his
own
room
and
so
was
able
to
give
me
part
of
his
food
it
was
agreed
that
when
the
police
left
the
house
should
slip
away
by
night
and
come
back
no
more
but
in
some
way
you
have
read
our
plans
she
tore
from
the
bosom
of
her
dress
small
packet
these
are
my
last
words
said
she
here
is
the
packet
which
will
save
alexis
confide
it
to
your
honour
and
to
your
love
of
justice
take
it
you
will
deliver
it
at
the
russian
embassy
now
have
done
my
duty
and
stop
her
cried
holmes
he
had
bounded
across
the
room
and
had
wrenched
small
phial
from
her
hand
too
late
she
said
sinking
back
on
the
bed
too
late
took
the
poison
before
left
my
hiding
place
my
head
swims
am
going
charge
you
sir
to
remember
the
packet
simple
case
and
yet
in
some
ways
an
instructive
one
holmes
remarked
as
we
travelled
back
to
town
it
hinged
from
the
outset
upon
the
pince
nez
but
for
the
fortunate
chance
of
the
dying
man
having
seized
these
am
not
sure
that
we
could
ever
have
reached
our
solution
it
was
clear
to
me
from
the
strength
of
the
glasses
that
the
wearer
must
have
been
very
blind
and
helpless
when
deprived
of
them
when
you
asked
me
to
believe
that
she
walked
along
narrow
strip
of
grass
without
once
making
false
step
remarked
as
you
may
remember
that
it
was
noteworthy
performance
in
my
mind
set
it
down
as
an
impossible
performance
save
in
the
unlikely
case
that
she
had
second
pair
of
glasses
was
forced
therefore
to
seriously
consider
the
hypothesis
that
she
had
remained
within
the
house
on
perceiving
the
similarity
of
the
two
corridors
it
became
clear
that
she
might
very
easily
have
made
such
mistake
and
in
that
case
it
was
evident
that
she
must
have
entered
the
professor
room
was
keenly
on
the
alert
therefore
for
whatever
would
bear
out
this
supposition
and
examined
the
room
narrowly
for
anything
in
the
shape
of
hiding
place
the
carpet
seemed
continuous
and
firmly
nailed
so
dismissed
the
idea
of
trap
door
there
might
well
be
recess
behind
the
books
as
you
are
aware
such
devices
are
common
in
old
libraries
observed
that
books
were
piled
on
the
floor
at
all
other
points
but
that
one
bookcase
was
left
clear
this
then
might
be
the
door
could
see
no
marks
to
guide
me
but
the
carpet
was
of
dun
colour
which
lends
itself
very
well
to
examination
therefore
smoked
great
number
of
those
excellent
cigarettes
and
dropped
the
ash
all
over
the
space
in
front
of
the
suspected
bookcase
it
was
simple
trick
but
exceedingly
effective
then
went
downstairs
and
ascertained
in
your
presence
watson
without
your
perceiving
the
drift
of
my
remarks
that
professor
coram
consumption
of
food
had
increased
as
one
would
expect
when
he
is
supplying
second
person
we
then
ascended
to
the
room
again
when
by
upsetting
the
cigarette
box
obtained
very
excellent
view
of
the
floor
and
was
able
to
see
quite
clearly
from
the
traces
upon
the
cigarette
ash
that
the
prisoner
had
in
our
absence
come
out
from
her
retreat
well
hopkins
here
we
are
at
charing
cross
and
congratulate
you
on
having
brought
your
case
to
successful
conclusion
you
are
going
to
head
quarters
no
doubt
think
watson
you
and
will
drive
together
to
the

the
adventure
of
the
missing
three
quarter
we
were
fairly
accustomed
to
receive
weird
telegrams
at
baker
street
but
have
particular
recollection
of
one
which
reached
us
on
gloomy
february
morning
some
seven
or
eight
years
ago
and
gave
mr
sherlock
holmes
puzzled
quarter
of
an
hour
it
was
addressed
to
him
and
ran
thus
please
await
me
terrible
misfortune
right
wing
three
quarter
missing
indispensable
to
morrow
overton
strand
post
mark
and
dispatched
ten
thirty
six
said
holmes
reading
it
over
and
over
mr
overton
was
evidently
considerably
excited
when
he
sent
it
and
somewhat
incoherent
in
consequence
well
he
will
be
here
dare
say
by
the
time
have
looked
through
the
times
and
then
we
shall
know
all
about
it
even
the
most
insignificant
problem
would
be
welcome
in
these
stagnant
days
things
had
indeed
been
very
slow
with
us
and
had
learned
to
dread
such
periods
of
inaction
for
knew
by
experience
that
my
companion
brain
was
so
abnormally
active
that
it
was
dangerous
to
leave
it
without
material
upon
which
to
work
for
years
had
gradually
weaned
him
from
that
drug
mania
which
had
threatened
once
to
check
his
remarkable
career
now
knew
that
under
ordinary
conditions
he
no
longer
craved
for
this
artificial
stimulus
but
was
well
aware
that
the
fiend
was
not
dead
but
sleeping
and
have
known
that
the
sleep
was
light
one
and
the
waking
near
when
in
periods
of
idleness
have
seen
the
drawn
look
upon
holmes
ascetic
face
and
the
brooding
of
his
deep
set
and
inscrutable
eyes
therefore
blessed
this
mr
overton
whoever
he
might
be
since
he
had
come
with
his
enigmatic
message
to
break
that
dangerous
calm
which
brought
more
peril
to
my
friend
than
all
the
storms
of
his
tempestuous
life
as
we
had
expected
the
telegram
was
soon
followed
by
its
sender
and
the
card
of
mr
cyril
overton
of
trinity
college
cambridge
announced
the
arrival
of
an
enormous
young
man
sixteen
stone
of
solid
bone
and
muscle
who
spanned
the
doorway
with
his
broad
shoulders
and
looked
from
one
of
us
to
the
other
with
comely
face
which
was
haggard
with
anxiety
mr
sherlock
holmes
my
companion
bowed
ve
been
down
to
scotland
yard
mr
holmes
saw
inspector
stanley
hopkins
he
advised
me
to
come
to
you
he
said
the
case
so
far
as
he
could
see
was
more
in
your
line
than
in
that
of
the
regular
police
pray
sit
down
and
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
it
awful
mr
holmes
simply
awful
wonder
my
hair
isn
grey
godfrey
staunton
you
ve
heard
of
him
of
course
he
simply
the
hinge
that
the
whole
team
turns
on
rather
spare
two
from
the
pack
and
have
godfrey
for
my
three
quarter
line
whether
it
passing
or
tackling
or
dribbling
there
no
one
to
touch
him
and
then
he
got
the
head
and
can
hold
us
all
together
what
am
to
do
that
what
ask
you
mr
holmes
there
moorhouse
first
reserve
but
he
is
trained
as
half
and
he
always
edges
right
in
on
to
the
scrum
instead
of
keeping
out
on
the
touch
line
he
fine
place
kick
it
true
but
then
he
has
no
judgment
and
he
can
sprint
for
nuts
why
morton
or
johnson
the
oxford
fliers
could
romp
round
him
stevenson
is
fast
enough
but
he
couldn
drop
from
the
twenty
five
line
and
three
quarter
who
can
either
punt
or
drop
isn
worth
place
for
pace
alone
no
mr
holmes
we
are
done
unless
you
can
help
me
to
find
godfrey
staunton
my
friend
had
listened
with
amused
surprise
to
this
long
speech
which
was
poured
forth
with
extraordinary
vigour
and
earnestness
every
point
being
driven
home
by
the
slapping
of
brawny
hand
upon
the
speaker
knee
when
our
visitor
was
silent
holmes
stretched
out
his
hand
and
took
down
letter
of
his
commonplace
book
for
once
he
dug
in
vain
into
that
mine
of
varied
information
there
is
arthur
staunton
the
rising
young
forger
said
he
and
there
was
henry
staunton
whom
helped
to
hang
but
godfrey
staunton
is
new
name
to
me
it
was
our
visitor
turn
to
look
surprised
why
mr
holmes
thought
you
knew
things
said
he
suppose
then
if
you
have
never
heard
of
godfrey
staunton
you
don
know
cyril
overton
either
holmes
shook
his
head
good
humouredly
great
scot
cried
the
athlete
why
was
first
reserve
for
england
against
wales
and
ve
skippered
the
varsity
all
this
year
but
that
nothing
didn
think
there
was
soul
in
england
who
didn
know
godfrey
staunton
the
crack
three
quarter
cambridge
blackheath
and
five
internationals
good
lord
mr
holmes
where
have
you
lived
holmes
laughed
at
the
young
giant
naive
astonishment
you
live
in
different
world
to
me
mr
overton
sweeter
and
healthier
one
my
ramifications
stretch
out
into
many
sections
of
society
but
never
am
happy
to
say
into
amateur
sport
which
is
the
best
and
soundest
thing
in
england
however
your
unexpected
visit
this
morning
shows
me
that
even
in
that
world
of
fresh
air
and
fair
play
there
may
be
work
for
me
to
do
so
now
my
good
sir
beg
you
to
sit
down
and
to
tell
me
slowly
and
quietly
exactly
what
it
is
that
has
occurred
and
how
you
desire
that
should
help
you
young
overton
face
assumed
the
bothered
look
of
the
man
who
is
more
accustomed
to
using
his
muscles
than
his
wits
but
by
degrees
with
many
repetitions
and
obscurities
which
may
omit
from
his
narrative
he
laid
his
strange
story
before
us
it
this
way
mr
holmes
as
have
said
am
the
skipper
of
the
rugger
team
of
cambridge
varsity
and
godfrey
staunton
is
my
best
man
to
morrow
we
play
oxford
yesterday
we
all
came
up
and
we
settled
at
bentley
private
hotel
at
ten
clock
went
round
and
saw
that
all
the
fellows
had
gone
to
roost
for
believe
in
strict
training
and
plenty
of
sleep
to
keep
team
fit
had
word
or
two
with
godfrey
before
he
turned
in
he
seemed
to
me
to
be
pale
and
bothered
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
he
said
he
was
all
right
just
touch
of
headache
bade
him
good
night
and
left
him
half
an
hour
later
the
porter
tells
me
that
rough
looking
man
with
beard
called
with
note
for
godfrey
he
had
not
gone
to
bed
and
the
note
was
taken
to
his
room
godfrey
read
it
and
fell
back
in
chair
as
if
he
had
been
pole
axed
the
porter
was
so
scared
that
he
was
going
to
fetch
me
but
godfrey
stopped
him
had
drink
of
water
and
pulled
himself
together
then
he
went
downstairs
said
few
words
to
the
man
who
was
waiting
in
the
hall
and
the
two
of
them
went
off
together
the
last
that
the
porter
saw
of
them
they
were
almost
running
down
the
street
in
the
direction
of
the
strand
this
morning
godfrey
room
was
empty
his
bed
had
never
been
slept
in
and
his
things
were
all
just
as
had
seen
them
the
night
before
he
had
gone
off
at
moment
notice
with
this
stranger
and
no
word
has
come
from
him
since
don
believe
he
will
ever
come
back
he
was
sportsman
was
godfrey
down
to
his
marrow
and
he
wouldn
have
stopped
his
training
and
let
in
his
skipper
if
it
were
not
for
some
cause
that
was
too
strong
for
him
no
feel
as
if
he
were
gone
for
good
and
we
should
never
see
him
again
sherlock
holmes
listened
with
the
deepest
attention
to
this
singular
narrative
what
did
you
do
he
asked
wired
to
cambridge
to
learn
if
anything
had
been
heard
of
him
there
have
had
an
answer
no
one
has
seen
him
could
he
have
got
back
to
cambridge
yes
there
is
late
train
quarter
past
eleven
but
so
far
as
you
can
ascertain
he
did
not
take
it
no
he
has
not
been
seen
what
did
you
do
next
wired
to
lord
mount
james
why
to
lord
mount
james
godfrey
is
an
orphan
and
lord
mount
james
is
his
nearest
relative
his
uncle
believe
indeed
this
throws
new
light
upon
the
matter
lord
mount
james
is
one
of
the
richest
men
in
england
so
ve
heard
godfrey
say
and
your
friend
was
closely
related
yes
he
was
his
heir
and
the
old
boy
is
nearly
eighty
cram
full
of
gout
too
they
say
he
could
chalk
his
billiard
cue
with
his
knuckles
he
never
allowed
godfrey
shilling
in
his
life
for
he
is
an
absolute
miser
but
it
will
all
come
to
him
right
enough
have
you
heard
from
lord
mount
james
no
what
motive
could
your
friend
have
in
going
to
lord
mount
james
well
something
was
worrying
him
the
night
before
and
if
it
was
to
do
with
money
it
is
possible
that
he
would
make
for
his
nearest
relative
who
had
so
much
of
it
though
from
all
have
heard
he
would
not
have
much
chance
of
getting
it
godfrey
was
not
fond
of
the
old
man
he
would
not
go
if
he
could
help
it
well
we
can
soon
determine
that
if
your
friend
was
going
to
his
relative
lord
mount
james
you
have
then
to
explain
the
visit
of
this
rough
looking
fellow
at
so
late
an
hour
and
the
agitation
that
was
caused
by
his
coming

cyril
overton
pressed
his
hands
to
his
head
can
make
nothing
of
it
said
he
well
have
clear
day
and
shall
be
happy
to
look
into
the
matter
said
holmes
should
strongly
recommend
you
to
make
your
preparations
for
your
match
without
reference
to
this
young
gentleman
it
must
as
you
say
have
been
an
overpowering
necessity
which
tore
him
away
in
such
fashion
and
the
same
necessity
is
likely
to
hold
him
away
let
us
step
round
together
to
this
hotel
and
see
if
the
porter
can
throw
any
fresh
light
upon
the
matter
sherlock
holmes
was
past
master
in
the
art
of
putting
humble
witness
at
his
ease
and
very
soon
in
the
privacy
of
godfrey
staunton
abandoned
room
he
had
extracted
all
that
the
porter
had
to
tell
the
visitor
of
the
night
before
was
not
gentleman
neither
was
he
working
man
he
was
simply
what
the
porter
described
as
medium
looking
chap
man
of
fifty
beard
grizzled
pale
face
quietly
dressed
he
seemed
himself
to
be
agitated
the
porter
had
observed
his
hand
trembling
when
he
had
held
out
the
note
godfrey
staunton
had
crammed
the
note
into
his
pocket
staunton
had
not
shaken
hands
with
the
man
in
the
hall
they
had
exchanged
few
sentences
of
which
the
porter
had
only
distinguished
the
one
word
time
then
they
had
hurried
off
in
the
manner
described
it
was
just
half
past
ten
by
the
hall
clock
let
me
see
said
holmes
seating
himself
on
staunton
bed
you
are
the
day
porter
are
you
not
yes
sir
go
off
duty
at
eleven
the
night
porter
saw
nothing
suppose
no
sir
one
theatre
party
came
in
late
no
one
else
were
you
on
duty
all
day
yesterday
yes
sir
did
you
take
any
messages
to
mr
staunton
yes
sir
one
telegram
ah
that
interesting
what
clock
was
this
about
six
where
was
mr
staunton
when
he
received
it
here
in
his
room
were
you
present
when
he
opened
it
yes
sir
waited
to
see
if
there
was
an
answer
well
was
there
yes
sir
he
wrote
an
answer
did
you
take
it
no
he
took
it
himself
but
he
wrote
it
in
your
presence
yes
sir
was
standing
by
the
door
and
he
with
his
back
turned
at
that
table
when
he
had
written
it
he
said
all
right
porter
will
take
this
myself
what
did
he
write
it
with
pen
sir
was
the
telegraphic
form
one
of
these
on
the
table
yes
sir
it
was
the
top
one
holmes
rose
taking
the
forms
he
carried
them
over
to
the
window
and
carefully
examined
that
which
was
uppermost
it
is
pity
he
did
not
write
in
pencil
said
he
throwing
them
down
again
with
shrug
of
disappointment
as
you
have
no
doubt
frequently
observed
watson
the
impression
usually
goes
through
fact
which
has
dissolved
many
happy
marriage
however
can
find
no
trace
here
rejoice
however
to
perceive
that
he
wrote
with
broad
pointed
quill
pen
and
can
hardly
doubt
that
we
will
find
some
impression
upon
this
blotting
pad
ah
yes
surely
this
is
the
very
thing
he
tore
off
strip
of
the
blotting
paper
and
turned
towards
us
the
following
hieroglyphic
so
that
is
the
tail
end
of
the
telegram
which
godfrey
staunton
dispatched
within
few
hours
of
his
disappearance
there
are
at
least
six
words
of
the
message
which
have
escaped
us
but
what
remains
stand
by
us
for
god
sake
proves
that
this
young
man
saw
formidable
danger
which
approached
him
and
from
which
someone
else
could
protect
him
us
mark
you
another
person
was
involved
who
should
it
be
but
the
pale
faced
bearded
man
who
seemed
himself
in
so
nervous
state
what
then
is
the
connection
between
godfrey
staunton
and
the
bearded
man
and
what
is
the
third
source
from
which
each
of
them
sought
for
help
against
pressing
danger
our
inquiry
has
already
narrowed
down
to
that
we
have
only
to
find
to
whom
that
telegram
is
addressed
suggested
exactly
my
dear
watson
your
reflection
though
profound
had
already
crossed
my
mind
but
dare
say
it
may
have
come
to
your
notice
that
if
you
walk
into
post
office
and
demand
to
see
the
counterfoil
of
another
man
message
there
may
be
some
disinclination
on
the
part
of
the
officials
to
oblige
you
there
is
so
much
red
tape
in
these
matters
however
have
no
doubt
that
with
little
delicacy
and
finesse
the
end
may
be
attained
meanwhile
should
like
in
your
presence
mr
overton
to
go
through
these
papers
which
have
been
left
upon
the
table
there
were
number
of
letters
bills
and
note
books
which
holmes
turned
over
and
examined
with
quick
nervous
fingers
and
darting
penetrating
eyes
nothing
here
he
said
at
last
by
the
way
suppose
your
friend
was
healthy
young
fellow
nothing
amiss
with
him
sound
as
bell
have
you
ever
known
him
ill
not
day
he
has
been
laid
up
with
hack
and
once
he
slipped
his
knee
cap
but
that
was
nothing
perhaps
he
was
not
so
strong
as
you
suppose
should
think
he
may
have
had
some
secret
trouble
with
your
assent
will
put
one
or
two
of
these
papers
in
my
pocket
in
case
they
should
bear
upon
our
future
inquiry
one
moment
one
moment
cried
querulous
voice
and
we
looked
up
to
find
queer
little
old
man
jerking
and
twitching
in
the
doorway
he
was
dressed
in
rusty
black
with
very
broad
brimmed
top
hat
and
loose
white
necktie
the
whole
effect
being
that
of
very
rustic
parson
or
of
an
undertaker
mute
yet
in
spite
of
his
shabby
and
even
absurd
appearance
his
voice
had
sharp
crackle
and
his
manner
quick
intensity
which
commanded
attention
who
are
you
sir
and
by
what
right
do
you
touch
this
gentleman
papers
he
asked
am
private
detective
and
am
endeavouring
to
explain
his
disappearance
oh
you
are
you
and
who
instructed
you
eh
this
gentleman
mr
staunton
friend
was
referred
to
me
by
scotland
yard
who
are
you
sir
am
cyril
overton
then
it
is
you
who
sent
me
telegram
my
name
is
lord
mount
james
came
round
as
quickly
as
the
bayswater
bus
would
bring
me
so
you
have
instructed
detective
yes
sir
and
are
you
prepared
to
meet
the
cost
have
no
doubt
sir
that
my
friend
godfrey
when
we
find
him
will
be
prepared
to
do
that
but
if
he
is
never
found
eh
answer
me
that
in
that
case
no
doubt
his
family
nothing
of
the
sort
sir
screamed
the
little
man
don
look
to
me
for
penny
not
penny
you
understand
that
mr
detective
am
all
the
family
that
this
young
man
has
got
and
tell
you
that
am
not
responsible
if
he
has
any
expectations
it
is
due
to
the
fact
that
have
never
wasted
money
and
do
not
propose
to
begin
to
do
so
now
as
to
those
papers
with
which
you
are
making
so
free
may
tell
you
that
in
case
there
should
be
anything
of
any
value
among
them
you
will
be
held
strictly
to
account
for
what
you
do
with
them
very
good
sir
said
sherlock
holmes
may
ask
in
the
meanwhile
whether
you
have
yourself
any
theory
to
account
for
this
young
man
disappearance
no
sir
have
not
he
is
big
enough
and
old
enough
to
look
after
himself
and
if
he
is
so
foolish
as
to
lose
himself
entirely
refuse
to
accept
the
responsibility
of
hunting
for
him
quite
understand
your
position
said
holmes
with
mischievous
twinkle
in
his
eyes
perhaps
you
don
quite
understand
mine
godfrey
staunton
appears
to
have
been
poor
man
if
he
has
been
kidnapped
it
could
not
have
been
for
anything
which
he
himself
possesses
the
fame
of
your
wealth
has
gone
abroad
lord
mount
james
and
it
is
entirely
possible
that
gang
of
thieves
have
secured
your
nephew
in
order
to
gain
from
him
some
information
as
to
your
house
your
habits
and
your
treasure
the
face
of
our
unpleasant
little
visitor
turned
as
white
as
his
neckcloth
heavens
sir
what
an
idea
never
thought
of
such
villainy
what
inhuman
rogues
there
are
in
the
world
but
godfrey
is
fine
lad
staunch
lad
nothing
would
induce
him
to
give
his
old
uncle
away
ll
have
the
plate
moved
over
to
the
bank
this
evening
in
the
meantime
spare
no
pains
mr
detective
beg
you
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
bring
him
safely
back
as
to
money
well
so
far
as
fiver
or
even
tenner
goes
you
can
always
look
to
me
even
in
his
chastened
frame
of
mind
the
noble
miser
could
give
us
no
information
which
could
help
us
for
he
knew
little
of
the
private
life
of
his
nephew
our
only
clue
lay
in
the
truncated
telegram
and
with
copy
of
this
in
his
hand
holmes
set
forth
to
find
second
link
for
his
chain
we
had
shaken
off
lord
mount
james
and
overton
had
gone
to
consult
with
the
other
members
of
his
team
over
the
misfortune
which
had
befallen
them

there
was
telegraph
office
at
short
distance
from
the
hotel
we
halted
outside
it
worth
trying
watson
said
holmes
of
course
with
warrant
we
could
demand
to
see
the
counterfoils
but
we
have
not
reached
that
stage
yet
don
suppose
they
remember
faces
in
so
busy
place
let
us
venture
it
am
sorry
to
trouble
you
said
he
in
his
blandest
manner
to
the
young
woman
behind
the
grating
there
is
some
small
mistake
about
telegram
sent
yesterday
have
had
no
answer
and
very
much
fear
that
must
have
omitted
to
put
my
name
at
the
end
could
you
tell
me
if
this
was
so
the
young
woman
turned
over
sheaf
of
counterfoils
what
clock
was
it
she
asked
little
after
six
whom
was
it
to
holmes
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
and
glanced
at
me
the
last
words
in
it
were
for
god
sake
he
whispered
confidentially
am
very
anxious
at
getting
no
answer
the
young
woman
separated
one
of
the
forms
this
is
it
there
is
no
name
said
she
smoothing
it
out
upon
the
counter
then
that
of
course
accounts
for
my
getting
no
answer
said
holmes
dear
me
how
very
stupid
of
me
to
be
sure
good
morning
miss
and
many
thanks
for
having
relieved
my
mind
he
chuckled
and
rubbed
his
hands
when
we
found
ourselves
in
the
street
once
more
well
asked
we
progress
my
dear
watson
we
progress
had
seven
different
schemes
for
getting
glimpse
of
that
telegram
but
could
hardly
hope
to
succeed
the
very
first
time
and
what
have
you
gained
starting
point
for
our
investigation
he
hailed
cab
king
cross
station
said
he
we
have
journey
then
yes
think
we
must
run
down
to
cambridge
together
all
the
indications
seem
to
me
to
point
in
that
direction
tell
me
asked
as
we
rattled
up
gray
inn
road
have
you
any
suspicion
yet
as
to
the
cause
of
the
disappearance
don
think
that
among
all
our
cases
have
known
one
where
the
motives
are
more
obscure
surely
you
don
really
imagine
that
he
may
be
kidnapped
in
order
to
give
information
against
his
wealthy
uncle
confess
my
dear
watson
that
does
not
appeal
to
me
as
very
probable
explanation
it
struck
me
however
as
being
the
one
which
was
most
likely
to
interest
that
exceedingly
unpleasant
old
person
it
certainly
did
that
but
what
are
your
alternatives
could
mention
several
you
must
admit
that
it
is
curious
and
suggestive
that
this
incident
should
occur
on
the
eve
of
this
important
match
and
should
involve
the
only
man
whose
presence
seems
essential
to
the
success
of
the
side
it
may
of
course
be
coincidence
but
it
is
interesting
amateur
sport
is
free
from
betting
but
good
deal
of
outside
betting
goes
on
among
the
public
and
it
is
possible
that
it
might
be
worth
someone
while
to
get
at
player
as
the
ruffians
of
the
turf
get
at
race
horse
there
is
one
explanation
second
very
obvious
one
is
that
this
young
man
really
is
the
heir
of
great
property
however
modest
his
means
may
at
present
be
and
it
is
not
impossible
that
plot
to
hold
him
for
ransom
might
be
concocted
these
theories
take
no
account
of
the
telegram
quite
true
watson
the
telegram
still
remains
the
only
solid
thing
with
which
we
have
to
deal
and
we
must
not
permit
our
attention
to
wander
away
from
it
is
to
gain
light
upon
the
purpose
of
this
telegram
that
we
are
now
upon
our
way
to
cambridge
the
path
of
our
investigation
is
at
present
obscure
but
shall
be
very
much
surprised
if
before
evening
we
have
not
cleared
it
up
or
made
considerable
advance
along
it
was
already
dark
when
we
reached
the
old
university
city
holmes
took
cab
at
the
station
and
ordered
the
man
to
drive
to
the
house
of
dr
leslie
armstrong
few
minutes
later
we
had
stopped
at
large
mansion
in
the
busiest
thoroughfare
we
were
shown
in
and
after
long
wait
were
at
last
admitted
into
the
consulting
room
where
we
found
the
doctor
seated
behind
his
table
it
argues
the
degree
in
which
had
lost
touch
with
my
profession
that
the
name
of
leslie
armstrong
was
unknown
to
me
now
am
aware
that
he
is
not
only
one
of
the
heads
of
the
medical
school
of
the
university
but
thinker
of
european
reputation
in
more
than
one
branch
of
science
yet
even
without
knowing
his
brilliant
record
one
could
not
fail
to
be
impressed
by
mere
glance
at
the
man
the
square
massive
face
the
brooding
eyes
under
the
thatched
brows
and
the
granite
moulding
of
the
inflexible
jaw
man
of
deep
character
man
with
an
alert
mind
grim
ascetic
self
contained
formidable
so
read
dr
leslie
armstrong
he
held
my
friend
card
in
his
hand
and
he
looked
up
with
no
very
pleased
expression
upon
his
dour
features
have
heard
your
name
mr
sherlock
holmes
and
am
aware
of
your
profession
one
of
which
by
no
means
approve
in
that
doctor
you
will
find
yourself
in
agreement
with
every
criminal
in
the
country
said
my
friend
quietly
so
far
as
your
efforts
are
directed
towards
the
suppression
of
crime
sir
they
must
have
the
support
of
every
reasonable
member
of
the
community
though
cannot
doubt
that
the
official
machinery
is
amply
sufficient
for
the
purpose
where
your
calling
is
more
open
to
criticism
is
when
you
pry
into
the
secrets
of
private
individuals
when
you
rake
up
family
matters
which
are
better
hidden
and
when
you
incidentally
waste
the
time
of
men
who
are
more
busy
than
yourself
at
the
present
moment
for
example
should
be
writing
treatise
instead
of
conversing
with
you
no
doubt
doctor
and
yet
the
conversation
may
prove
more
important
than
the
treatise
incidentally
may
tell
you
that
we
are
doing
the
reverse
of
what
you
very
justly
blame
and
that
we
are
endeavouring
to
prevent
anything
like
public
exposure
of
private
matters
which
must
necessarily
follow
when
once
the
case
is
fairly
in
the
hands
of
the
official
police
you
may
look
upon
me
simply
as
an
irregular
pioneer
who
goes
in
front
of
the
regular
forces
of
the
country
have
come
to
ask
you
about
mr
godfrey
staunton
what
about
him
you
know
him
do
you
not
he
is
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
you
are
aware
that
he
has
disappeared
ah
indeed
there
was
no
change
of
expression
in
the
rugged
features
of
the
doctor
he
left
his
hotel
last
night
he
has
not
been
heard
of
no
doubt
he
will
return
to
morrow
is
the
varsity
football
match
have
no
sympathy
with
these
childish
games
the
young
man
fate
interests
me
deeply
since
know
him
and
like
him
the
football
match
does
not
come
within
my
horizon
at
all
claim
your
sympathy
then
in
my
investigation
of
mr
staunton
fate
do
you
know
where
he
is
certainly
not
you
have
not
seen
him
since
yesterday
no
have
not
was
mr
staunton
healthy
man
absolutely
did
you
ever
know
him
ill
never
holmes
popped
sheet
of
paper
before
the
doctor
eyes
then
perhaps
you
will
explain
this
receipted
bill
for
thirteen
guineas
paid
by
mr
godfrey
staunton
last
month
to
dr
leslie
armstrong
of
cambridge
picked
it
out
from
among
the
papers
upon
his
desk
the
doctor
flushed
with
anger
do
not
feel
that
there
is
any
reason
why
should
render
an
explanation
to
you
mr
holmes
replaced
the
bill
in
his
note
book
if
you
prefer
public
explanation
it
must
come
sooner
or
later
said
he
have
already
told
you
that
can
hush
up
that
which
others
will
be
bound
to
publish
and
you
would
really
be
wiser
to
take
me
into
your
complete
confidence
know
nothing
about
it
did
you
hear
from
mr
staunton
in
london
certainly
not
dear
me
dear
me
the
post
office
again
holmes
sighed
wearily
most
urgent
telegram
was
dispatched
to
you
from
london
by
godfrey
staunton
at
six
fifteen
yesterday
evening
telegram
which
is
undoubtedly
associated
with
his
disappearance
and
yet
you
have
not
had
it
is
most
culpable
shall
certainly
go
down
to
the
office
here
and
register
complaint
dr
leslie
armstrong
sprang
up
from
behind
his
desk
and
his
dark
face
was
crimson
with
fury
ll
trouble
you
to
walk
out
of
my
house
sir
said
he
you
can
tell
your
employer
lord
mount
james
that
do
not
wish
to
have
anything
to
do
either
with
him
or
with
his
agents
no
sir
not
another
word
he
rang
the
bell
furiously
john
show
these
gentlemen
out
pompous
butler
ushered
us
severely
to
the
door
and
we
found
ourselves
in
the
street
holmes
burst
out
laughing
dr
leslie
armstrong
is
certainly
man
of
energy
and
character
said
he
have
not
seen
man
who
if
he
turned
his
talents
that
way
was
more
calculated
to
fill
the
gap
left
by
the
illustrious
moriarty
and
now
my
poor
watson
here
we
are
stranded
and
friendless
in
this
inhospitable
town
which
we
cannot
leave
without
abandoning
our
case
this
little
inn
just
opposite
armstrong
house
is
singularly
adapted
to
our
needs
if
you
would
engage
front
room
and
purchase
the
necessaries
for
the
night
may
have
time
to
make
few
inquiries
страница

these
few
inquiries
proved
however
to
be
more
lengthy
proceeding
than
holmes
had
imagined
for
he
did
not
return
to
the
inn
until
nearly
nine
clock
he
was
pale
and
dejected
stained
with
dust
and
exhausted
with
hunger
and
fatigue
cold
supper
was
ready
upon
the
table
and
when
his
needs
were
satisfied
and
his
pipe
alight
he
was
ready
to
take
that
half
comic
and
wholly
philosophic
view
which
was
natural
to
him
when
his
affairs
were
going
awry
the
sound
of
carriage
wheels
caused
him
to
rise
and
glance
out
of
the
window
brougham
and
pair
of
greys
under
the
glare
of
gas
lamp
stood
before
the
doctor
door
it
been
out
three
hours
said
holmes
started
at
half
past
six
and
here
it
is
back
again
that
gives
radius
of
ten
or
twelve
miles
and
he
does
it
once
or
sometimes
twice
day
no
unusual
thing
for
doctor
in
practice
but
armstrong
is
not
really
doctor
in
practice
he
is
lecturer
and
consultant
but
he
does
not
care
for
general
practice
which
distracts
him
from
his
literary
work
why
then
does
he
make
these
long
journeys
which
must
be
exceedingly
irksome
to
him
and
who
is
it
that
he
visits
his
coachman
my
dear
watson
can
you
doubt
that
it
was
to
him
that
first
applied
do
not
know
whether
it
came
from
his
own
innate
depravity
or
from
the
promptings
of
his
master
but
he
was
rude
enough
to
set
dog
at
me
neither
dog
nor
man
liked
the
look
of
my
stick
however
and
the
matter
fell
through
relations
were
strained
after
that
and
further
inquiries
out
of
the
question
all
that
have
learned
got
from
friendly
native
in
the
yard
of
our
own
inn
it
was
he
who
told
me
of
the
doctor
habits
and
of
his
daily
journey
at
that
instant
to
give
point
to
his
words
the
carriage
came
round
to
the
door
could
you
not
follow
it
excellent
watson
you
are
scintillating
this
evening
the
idea
did
cross
my
mind
there
is
as
you
may
have
observed
bicycle
shop
next
to
our
inn
into
this
rushed
engaged
bicycle
and
was
able
to
get
started
before
the
carriage
was
quite
out
of
sight
rapidly
overtook
it
and
then
keeping
at
discreet
distance
of
hundred
yards
or
so
followed
its
lights
until
we
were
clear
of
the
town
we
had
got
well
out
on
the
country
road
when
somewhat
mortifying
incident
occurred
the
carriage
stopped
the
doctor
alighted
walked
swiftly
back
to
where
had
also
halted
and
told
me
in
an
excellent
sardonic
fashion
that
he
feared
the
road
was
narrow
and
that
he
hoped
his
carriage
did
not
impede
the
passage
of
my
bicycle
nothing
could
have
been
more
admirable
than
his
way
of
putting
it
at
once
rode
past
the
carriage
and
keeping
to
the
main
road
went
on
for
few
miles
and
then
halted
in
convenient
place
to
see
if
the
carriage
passed
there
was
no
sign
of
it
however
and
so
it
became
evident
that
it
had
turned
down
one
of
several
side
roads
which
had
observed
rode
back
but
again
saw
nothing
of
the
carriage
and
now
as
you
perceive
it
has
returned
after
me
of
course
had
at
the
outset
no
particular
reason
to
connect
these
journeys
with
the
disappearance
of
godfrey
staunton
and
was
only
inclined
to
investigate
them
on
the
general
grounds
that
everything
which
concerns
dr
armstrong
is
at
present
of
interest
to
us
but
now
that
find
he
keeps
so
keen
look
out
upon
anyone
who
may
follow
him
on
these
excursions
the
affair
appears
more
important
and
shall
not
be
satisfied
until
have
made
the
matter
clear
we
can
follow
him
to
morrow
can
we
it
is
not
so
easy
as
you
seem
to
think
you
are
not
familiar
with
cambridgeshire
scenery
are
you
it
does
not
lend
itself
to
concealment
all
this
country
that
passed
over
to
night
is
as
flat
and
clean
as
the
palm
of
your
hand
and
the
man
we
are
following
is
no
fool
as
he
very
clearly
showed
to
night
have
wired
to
overton
to
let
us
know
any
fresh
london
developments
at
this
address
and
in
the
meantime
we
can
only
concentrate
our
attention
upon
dr
armstrong
whose
name
the
obliging
young
lady
at
the
office
allowed
me
to
read
upon
the
counterfoil
of
staunton
urgent
message
he
knows
where
the
young
man
is
to
that
ll
swear
and
if
he
knows
then
it
must
be
our
own
fault
if
we
cannot
manage
to
know
also
at
present
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
odd
trick
is
in
his
possession
and
as
you
are
aware
watson
it
is
not
my
habit
to
leave
the
game
in
that
condition
and
yet
the
next
day
brought
us
no
nearer
to
the
solution
of
the
mystery
note
was
handed
in
after
breakfast
which
holmes
passed
across
to
me
with
smile
sir
it
ran
can
assure
you
that
you
are
wasting
your
time
in
dogging
my
movements
have
as
you
discovered
last
night
window
at
the
back
of
my
brougham
and
if
you
desire
twenty
mile
ride
which
will
lead
you
to
the
spot
from
which
you
started
you
have
only
to
follow
me
meanwhile
can
inform
you
that
no
spying
upon
me
can
in
any
way
help
mr
godfrey
staunton
and
am
convinced
that
the
best
service
you
can
do
to
that
gentleman
is
to
return
at
once
to
london
and
to
report
to
your
employer
that
you
are
unable
to
trace
him
your
time
in
cambridge
will
certainly
be
wasted
yours
faithfully
leslie
armstrong
an
outspoken
honest
antagonist
is
the
doctor
said
holmes
well
he
excites
my
curiosity
and
must
really
know
more
before
leave
him
his
carriage
is
at
his
door
now
said
there
he
is
stepping
into
it
saw
him
glance
up
at
our
window
as
he
did
so
suppose
try
my
luck
upon
the
bicycle
no
my
dear
watson
with
all
respect
for
your
natural
acumen
do
not
think
that
you
are
quite
match
for
the
worthy
doctor
think
that
possibly
can
attain
our
end
by
some
independent
explorations
of
my
own
am
afraid
that
must
leave
you
to
your
own
devices
as
the
appearance
of
two
inquiring
strangers
upon
sleepy
countryside
might
excite
more
gossip
than
care
for
no
doubt
you
will
find
some
sights
to
amuse
you
in
this
venerable
city
and
hope
to
bring
back
more
favourable
report
to
you
before
evening
once
more
however
my
friend
was
destined
to
be
disappointed
he
came
back
at
night
weary
and
unsuccessful
have
had
blank
day
watson
having
got
the
doctor
general
direction
spent
the
day
in
visiting
all
the
villages
upon
that
side
of
cambridge
and
comparing
notes
with
publicans
and
other
local
news
agencies
have
covered
some
ground
chesterton
histon
waterbeach
and
oakington
have
each
been
explored
and
have
each
proved
disappointing
the
daily
appearance
of
brougham
and
pair
could
hardly
have
been
overlooked
in
such
sleepy
hollows
the
doctor
has
scored
once
more
is
there
telegram
for
me
yes
opened
it
here
it
is
ask
for
pompey
from
jeremy
dixon
trinity
college
don
understand
it
oh
it
is
clear
enough
it
is
from
our
friend
overton
and
is
in
answer
to
question
from
me
ll
just
send
round
note
to
mr
jeremy
dixon
and
then
have
no
doubt
that
our
luck
will
turn
by
the
way
is
there
any
news
of
the
match
yes
the
local
evening
paper
has
an
excellent
account
in
its
last
edition
oxford
won
by
goal
and
two
tries
the
last
sentences
of
the
description
say
the
defeat
of
the
light
blues
may
be
entirely
attributed
to
the
unfortunate
absence
of
the
crack
international
godfrey
staunton
whose
want
was
felt
at
every
instant
of
the
game
the
lack
of
combination
in
the
three
quarter
line
and
their
weakness
both
in
attack
and
defence
more
than
neutralized
the
efforts
of
heavy
and
hard
working
pack
then
our
friend
overton
forebodings
have
been
justified
said
holmes
personally
am
in
agreement
with
dr
armstrong
and
football
does
not
come
within
my
horizon
early
to
bed
to
night
watson
for
foresee
that
to
morrow
may
be
an
eventful
day
was
horrified
by
my
first
glimpse
of
holmes
next
morning
for
he
sat
by
the
fire
holding
his
tiny
hypodermic
syringe
associated
that
instrument
with
the
single
weakness
of
his
nature
and
feared
the
worst
when
saw
it
glittering
in
his
hand
he
laughed
at
my
expression
of
dismay
and
laid
it
upon
the
table
no
my
dear
fellow
there
is
no
cause
for
alarm
it
is
not
upon
this
occasion
the
instrument
of
evil
but
it
will
rather
prove
to
be
the
key
which
will
unlock
our
mystery
on
this
syringe
base
all
my
hopes
have
just
returned
from
small
scouting
expedition
and
everything
is
favourable
eat
good
breakfast
watson
for
propose
to
get
upon
dr
armstrong
trail
to
day
and
once
on
it
will
not
stop
for
rest
or
food
until
run
him
to
his
burrow
in
that
case
said
we
had
best
carry
our
breakfast
with
us
for
he
is
making
an
early
start
his
carriage
is
at
the
door
never
mind
let
him
go
he
will
be
clever
if
he
can
drive
where
cannot
follow
him
when
you
have
finished
come
downstairs
with
me
and
will
introduce
you
to
detective
who
is
very
eminent
specialist
in
the
work
that
lies
before
us
when
we
descended
followed
holmes
into
the
stable
yard
where
he
opened
the
door
of
loose
box
and
led
out
squat
lop
eared
white
and
tan
dog
something
between
beagle
and
foxhound

let
me
introduce
you
to
pompey
said
he
pompey
is
the
pride
of
the
local
draghounds
no
very
great
flier
as
his
build
will
show
but
staunch
hound
on
scent
well
pompey
you
may
not
be
fast
but
expect
you
will
be
too
fast
for
couple
of
middle
aged
london
gentlemen
so
will
take
the
liberty
of
fastening
this
leather
leash
to
your
collar
now
boy
come
along
and
show
what
you
can
do
he
led
him
across
to
the
doctor
door
the
dog
sniffed
round
for
an
instant
and
then
with
shrill
whine
of
excitement
started
off
down
the
street
tugging
at
his
leash
in
his
efforts
to
go
faster
in
half
an
hour
we
were
clear
of
the
town
and
hastening
down
country
road
what
have
you
done
holmes
asked
threadbare
and
venerable
device
but
useful
upon
occasion
walked
into
the
doctor
yard
this
morning
and
shot
my
syringe
full
of
aniseed
over
the
hind
wheel
draghound
will
follow
aniseed
from
here
to
john
groat
and
our
friend
armstrong
would
have
to
drive
through
the
cam
before
he
would
shake
pompey
off
his
trail
oh
the
cunning
rascal
this
is
how
he
gave
me
the
slip
the
other
night
the
dog
had
suddenly
turned
out
of
the
main
road
into
grass
grown
lane
half
mile
farther
this
opened
into
another
broad
road
and
the
trail
turned
hard
to
the
right
in
the
direction
of
the
town
which
we
had
just
quitted
the
road
took
sweep
to
the
south
of
the
town
and
continued
in
the
opposite
direction
to
that
in
which
we
started
this
detour
has
been
entirely
for
our
benefit
then
said
holmes
no
wonder
that
my
inquiries
among
those
villages
led
to
nothing
the
doctor
has
certainly
played
the
game
for
all
it
is
worth
and
one
would
like
to
know
the
reason
for
such
elaborate
deception
this
should
be
the
village
of
trumpington
to
the
right
of
us
and
by
jove
here
is
the
brougham
coming
round
the
corner
quick
watson
quick
or
we
are
done
he
sprang
through
gate
into
field
dragging
the
reluctant
pompey
after
him
we
had
hardly
got
under
the
shelter
of
the
hedge
when
the
carriage
rattled
past
caught
glimpse
of
dr
armstrong
within
his
shoulders
bowed
his
head
sunk
on
his
hands
the
very
image
of
distress
could
tell
by
my
companion
graver
face
that
he
also
had
seen
fear
there
is
some
dark
ending
to
our
quest
said
he
it
cannot
be
long
before
we
know
it
come
pompey
ah
it
is
the
cottage
in
the
field
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
we
had
reached
the
end
of
our
journey
pompey
ran
about
and
whined
eagerly
outside
the
gate
where
the
marks
of
the
brougham
wheels
were
still
to
be
seen
footpath
led
across
to
the
lonely
cottage
holmes
tied
the
dog
to
the
hedge
and
we
hastened
onwards
my
friend
knocked
at
the
little
rustic
door
and
knocked
again
without
response
and
yet
the
cottage
was
not
deserted
for
low
sound
came
to
our
ears
kind
of
drone
of
misery
and
despair
which
was
indescribably
melancholy
holmes
paused
irresolute
and
then
he
glanced
back
at
the
road
which
we
had
just
traversed
brougham
was
coming
down
it
and
there
could
be
no
mistaking
those
grey
horses
by
jove
the
doctor
is
coming
back
cried
holmes
that
settles
it
we
are
bound
to
see
what
it
means
before
he
comes
he
opened
the
door
and
we
stepped
into
the
hall
the
droning
sound
swelled
louder
upon
our
ears
until
it
became
one
long
deep
wail
of
distress
it
came
from
upstairs
holmes
darted
up
and
followed
him
he
pushed
open
half
closed
door
and
we
both
stood
appalled
at
the
sight
before
us
woman
young
and
beautiful
was
lying
dead
upon
the
bed
her
calm
pale
face
with
dim
wide
opened
blue
eyes
looked
upward
from
amid
great
tangle
of
golden
hair
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
half
sitting
half
kneeling
his
face
buried
in
the
clothes
was
young
man
whose
frame
was
racked
by
his
sobs
so
absorbed
was
he
by
his
bitter
grief
that
he
never
looked
up
until
holmes
hand
was
on
his
shoulder
are
you
mr
godfrey
staunton
yes
am
but
you
are
too
late
she
is
dead
the
man
was
so
dazed
that
he
could
not
be
made
to
understand
that
we
were
anything
but
doctors
who
had
been
sent
to
his
assistance
holmes
was
endeavouring
to
utter
few
words
of
consolation
and
to
explain
the
alarm
which
had
been
caused
to
his
friends
by
his
sudden
disappearance
when
there
was
step
upon
the
stairs
and
there
was
the
heavy
stern
questioning
face
of
dr
armstrong
at
the
door
so
gentlemen
said
he
you
have
attained
your
end
and
have
certainly
chosen
particularly
delicate
moment
for
your
intrusion
would
not
brawl
in
the
presence
of
death
but
can
assure
you
that
if
were
younger
man
your
monstrous
conduct
would
not
pass
with
impunity
excuse
me
dr
armstrong
think
we
are
little
at
cross
purposes
said
my
friend
with
dignity
if
you
could
step
downstairs
with
us
we
may
each
be
able
to
give
some
light
to
the
other
upon
this
miserable
affair
minute
later
the
grim
doctor
and
ourselves
were
in
the
sitting
room
below
well
sir
said
he
wish
you
to
understand
in
the
first
place
that
am
not
employed
by
lord
mount
james
and
that
my
sympathies
in
this
matter
are
entirely
against
that
nobleman
when
man
is
lost
it
is
my
duty
to
ascertain
his
fate
but
having
done
so
the
matter
ends
so
far
as
am
concerned
and
so
long
as
there
is
nothing
criminal
am
much
more
anxious
to
hush
up
private
scandals
than
to
give
them
publicity
if
as
imagine
there
is
no
breach
of
the
law
in
this
matter
you
can
absolutely
depend
upon
my
discretion
and
my
co
operation
in
keeping
the
facts
out
of
the
papers
dr
armstrong
took
quick
step
forward
and
wrung
holmes
by
the
hand
you
are
good
fellow
said
he
had
misjudged
you
thank
heaven
that
my
compunction
at
leaving
poor
staunton
all
alone
in
this
plight
caused
me
to
turn
my
carriage
back
and
so
to
make
your
acquaintance
knowing
as
much
as
you
do
the
situation
is
very
easily
explained
year
ago
godfrey
staunton
lodged
in
london
for
time
and
became
passionately
attached
to
his
landlady
daughter
whom
he
married
she
was
as
good
as
she
was
beautiful
and
as
intelligent
as
she
was
good
no
man
need
be
ashamed
of
such
wife
but
godfrey
was
the
heir
to
this
crabbed
old
nobleman
and
it
was
quite
certain
that
the
news
of
his
marriage
would
have
been
the
end
of
his
inheritance
knew
the
lad
well
and
loved
him
for
his
many
excellent
qualities
did
all
could
to
help
him
to
keep
things
straight
we
did
our
very
best
to
keep
the
thing
from
everyone
for
when
once
such
whisper
gets
about
it
is
not
long
before
everyone
has
heard
it
thanks
to
this
lonely
cottage
and
his
own
discretion
godfrey
has
up
to
now
succeeded
their
secret
was
known
to
no
one
save
to
me
and
to
one
excellent
servant
who
has
at
present
gone
for
assistance
to
trumpington
but
at
last
there
came
terrible
blow
in
the
shape
of
dangerous
illness
to
his
wife
it
was
consumption
of
the
most
virulent
kind
the
poor
boy
was
half
crazed
with
grief
and
yet
he
had
to
go
to
london
to
play
this
match
for
he
could
not
get
out
of
it
without
explanations
which
would
expose
his
secret
tried
to
cheer
him
up
by
wire
and
he
sent
me
one
in
reply
imploring
me
to
do
all
could
this
was
the
telegram
which
you
appear
in
some
inexplicable
way
to
have
seen
did
not
tell
him
how
urgent
the
danger
was
for
knew
that
he
could
do
no
good
here
but
sent
the
truth
to
the
girl
father
and
he
very
injudiciously
communicated
it
to
godfrey
the
result
was
that
he
came
straight
away
in
state
bordering
on
frenzy
and
has
remained
in
the
same
state
kneeling
at
the
end
of
her
bed
until
this
morning
death
put
an
end
to
her
sufferings
that
is
all
mr
holmes
and
am
sure
that
can
rely
upon
your
discretion
and
that
of
your
friend
holmes
grasped
the
doctor
hand
come
watson
said
he
and
we
passed
from
that
house
of
grief
into
the
pale
sunlight
of
the
winter
day
xii
the
adventure
of
the
abbey
grange
it
was
on
bitterly
cold
and
frosty
morning
during
the
winter
of
97
that
was
awakened
by
tugging
at
my
shoulder
it
was
holmes
the
candle
in
his
hand
shone
upon
his
eager
stooping
face
and
told
me
at
glance
that
something
was
amiss
come
watson
come
he
cried
the
game
is
afoot
not
word
into
your
clothes
and
come
ten
minutes
later
we
were
both
in
cab
and
rattling
through
the
silent
streets
on
our
way
to
charing
cross
station
the
first
faint
winter
dawn
was
beginning
to
appear
and
we
could
dimly
see
the
occasional
figure
of
an
early
workman
as
he
passed
us
blurred
and
indistinct
in
the
opalescent
london
reek
holmes
nestled
in
silence
into
his
heavy
coat
and
was
glad
to
do
the
same
for
the
air
was
most
bitter
and
neither
of
us
had
broken
our
fast
it
was
not
until
we
had
consumed
some
hot
tea
at
the
station
and
taken
our
places
in
the
kentish
train
that
we
were
sufficiently
thawed
he
to
speak
and
to
listen

note
from

my
dear
mr
holmes
should
be
very
glad
of
your
immediate
assistance
in
what
promises
to
be
most
remarkable
case
it
is
something
quite
in
your
line
except
for
releasing
the
lady
will
see
that
everything
is
kept
exactly
as
have
found
it
but
beg
you
not
to
lose
an
instant
as
it
is
difficult
to
leave
sir
eustace
there
yours
faithfully
stanley
hopkins
has
called
me
in
seven
times
and
on
each
occasion
his
summons
has
been
entirely
justified
said
holmes
fancy
that
every
one
of
his
cases
has
found
its
way
into
your
collection
and
must
admit
watson
that
you
have
some
power
of
selection
which
atones
for
much
which
deplore
in
your
narratives
your
fatal
habit
of
looking
at
everything
from
the
point
of
view
of
story
instead
of
as
scientific
exercise
has
ruined
what
might
have
been
an
instructive
and
even
classical
series
of
demonstrations
you
slur
over
work
of
the
utmost
finesse
and
delicacy
in
order
to
dwell
upon
sensational
details
which
may
excite
but
cannot
possibly
instruct
the
reader
why
do
you
not
write
them
yourself
said
with
some
bitterness
will
my
dear
watson
will
at
present
am
as
you
know
fairly
busy
but
propose
to
devote
my
declining
years
to
the
composition
of
text
book
which
shall
focus
the
whole
art
of
detection
into
one
volume
our
present
research
appears
to
be
case
of
murder
you
think
this
sir
eustace
is
dead
then
should
say
so
hopkins
writing
shows
considerable
agitation
and
he
is
not
an
emotional
man
yes
gather
there
has
been
violence
and
that
the
body
is
left
for
our
inspection
mere
suicide
would
not
have
caused
him
to
send
for
me
as
to
the
release
of
the
lady
it
would
appear
that
she
has
been
locked
in
her
room
during
the
tragedy
we
are
moving
in
high
life
watson
crackling
paper
monogram
coat
of
arms
picturesque
address
think
that
friend
hopkins
will
live
up
to
his
reputation
and
that
we
shall
have
an
interesting
morning
the
crime
was
committed
before
twelve
last
night
how
can
you
possibly
tell
by
an
inspection
of
the
trains
and
by
reckoning
the
time
the
local
police
had
to
be
called
in
they
had
to
communicate
with
scotland
yard
hopkins
had
to
go
out
and
he
in
turn
had
to
send
for
me
all
that
makes
fair
night
work
well
here
we
are
at
chislehurst
station
and
we
shall
soon
set
our
doubts
at
rest
drive
of
couple
of
miles
through
narrow
country
lanes
brought
us
to
park
gate
which
was
opened
for
us
by
an
old
lodge
keeper
whose
haggard
face
bore
the
reflection
of
some
great
disaster
the
avenue
ran
through
noble
park
between
lines
of
ancient
elms
and
ended
in
low
widespread
house
pillared
in
front
after
the
fashion
of
palladio
the
central
part
was
evidently
of
great
age
and
shrouded
in
ivy
but
the
large
windows
showed
that
modern
changes
had
been
carried
out
and
one
wing
of
the
house
appeared
to
be
entirely
new
the
youthful
figure
and
alert
eager
face
of
inspector
stanley
hopkins
confronted
us
in
the
open
doorway
very
glad
you
have
come
mr
holmes
and
you
too
dr
watson
but
indeed
if
had
my
time
over
again
should
not
have
troubled
you
for
since
the
lady
has
come
to
herself
she
has
given
so
clear
an
account
of
the
affair
that
there
is
not
much
left
for
us
to
do
you
remember
that
lewisham
gang
of
burglars
what
the
three
randalls
exactly
the
father
and
two
sons
it
their
work
have
not
doubt
of
it
they
did
job
at
sydenham
fortnight
ago
and
were
seen
and
described
rather
cool
to
do
another
so
soon
and
so
near
but
it
is
they
beyond
all
doubt
it
hanging
matter
this
time
sir
eustace
is
dead
then
yes
his
head
was
knocked
in
with
his
own
poker
sir
eustace
brackenstall
the
driver
tells
me
exactly
one
of
the
richest
men
in
kent
lady
brackenstall
is
in
the
morning
room
poor
lady
she
has
had
most
dreadful
experience
she
seemed
half
dead
when
saw
her
first
think
you
had
best
see
her
and
hear
her
account
of
the
facts
then
we
will
examine
the
dining
room
together
lady
brackenstall
was
no
ordinary
person
seldom
have
seen
so
graceful
figure
so
womanly
presence
and
so
beautiful
face
she
was
blonde
golden
haired
blue
eyed
and
would
no
doubt
have
had
the
perfect
complexion
which
goes
with
such
colouring
had
not
her
recent
experience
left
her
drawn
and
haggard
her
sufferings
were
physical
as
well
as
mental
for
over
one
eye
rose
hideous
plum
coloured
swelling
which
her
maid
tall
austere
woman
was
bathing
assiduously
with
vinegar
and
water
the
lady
lay
back
exhausted
upon
couch
but
her
quick
observant
gaze
as
we
entered
the
room
and
the
alert
expression
of
her
beautiful
features
showed
that
neither
her
wits
nor
her
courage
had
been
shaken
by
her
terrible
experience
she
was
enveloped
in
loose
dressing
gown
of
blue
and
silver
but
black
sequin
covered
dinner
dress
was
hung
upon
the
couch
beside
her
have
told
you
all
that
happened
mr
hopkins
she
said
wearily
could
you
not
repeat
it
for
me
well
if
you
think
it
necessary
will
tell
these
gentlemen
what
occurred
have
they
been
in
the
dining
room
yet
thought
they
had
better
hear
your
ladyship
story
first
shall
be
glad
when
you
can
arrange
matters
it
is
horrible
to
me
to
think
of
him
still
lying
there
she
shuddered
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
as
she
did
so
the
loose
gown
fell
back
from
her
forearms
holmes
uttered
an
exclamation
you
have
other
injuries
madam
what
is
this
two
vivid
red
spots
stood
out
on
one
of
the
white
round
limbs
she
hastily
covered
it
is
nothing
it
has
no
connection
with
the
hideous
business
of
last
night
if
you
and
your
friend
will
sit
down
will
tell
you
all
can
am
the
wife
of
sir
eustace
brackenstall
have
been
married
about
year
suppose
that
it
is
no
use
my
attempting
to
conceal
that
our
marriage
has
not
been
happy
one
fear
that
all
our
neighbours
would
tell
you
that
even
if
were
to
attempt
to
deny
it
perhaps
the
fault
may
be
partly
mine
was
brought
up
in
the
freer
less
conventional
atmosphere
of
south
australia
and
this
english
life
with
its
proprieties
and
its
primness
is
not
congenial
to
me
but
the
main
reason
lies
in
the
one
fact
which
is
notorious
to
everyone
and
that
is
that
sir
eustace
was
confirmed
drunkard
to
be
with
such
man
for
an
hour
is
unpleasant
can
you
imagine
what
it
means
for
sensitive
and
high
spirited
woman
to
be
tied
to
him
for
day
and
night
it
is
sacrilege
crime
villainy
to
hold
that
such
marriage
is
binding
say
that
these
monstrous
laws
of
yours
will
bring
curse
upon
the
land
heaven
will
not
let
such
wickedness
endure
for
an
instant
she
sat
up
her
cheeks
flushed
and
her
eyes
blazing
from
under
the
terrible
mark
upon
her
brow
then
the
strong
soothing
hand
of
the
austere
maid
drew
her
head
down
on
to
the
cushion
and
the
wild
anger
died
away
into
passionate
sobbing
at
last
she
continued
will
tell
you
about
last
night
you
are
aware
perhaps
that
in
this
house
all
servants
sleep
in
the
modern
wing
this
central
block
is
made
up
of
the
dwelling
rooms
with
the
kitchen
behind
and
our
bedroom
above
my
maid
theresa
sleeps
above
my
room
there
is
no
one
else
and
no
sound
could
alarm
those
who
are
in
the
farther
wing
this
must
have
been
well
known
to
the
robbers
or
they
would
not
have
acted
as
they
did
sir
eustace
retired
about
half
past
ten
the
servants
had
already
gone
to
their
quarters
only
my
maid
was
up
and
she
had
remained
in
her
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
until
needed
her
services
sat
until
after
eleven
in
this
room
absorbed
in
book
then
walked
round
to
see
that
all
was
right
before
went
upstairs
it
was
my
custom
to
do
this
myself
for
as
have
explained
sir
eustace
was
not
always
to
be
trusted
went
into
the
kitchen
the
butler
pantry
the
gun
room
the
billiard
room
the
drawing
room
and
finally
the
dining
room
as
approached
the
window
which
is
covered
with
thick
curtains
suddenly
felt
the
wind
blow
upon
my
face
and
realized
that
it
was
open
flung
the
curtain
aside
and
found
myself
face
to
face
with
broad
shouldered
elderly
man
who
had
just
stepped
into
the
room
the
window
is
long
french
one
which
really
forms
door
leading
to
the
lawn
held
my
bedroom
candle
lit
in
my
hand
and
by
its
light
behind
the
first
man
saw
two
others
who
were
in
the
act
of
entering
stepped
back
but
the
fellow
was
on
me
in
an
instant
he
caught
me
first
by
the
wrist
and
then
by
the
throat
opened
my
mouth
to
scream
but
he
struck
me
savage
blow
with
his
fist
over
the
eye
and
felled
me
to
the
ground
must
have
been
unconscious
for
few
minutes
for
when
came
to
myself
found
that
they
had
torn
down
the
bell
rope
and
had
secured
me
tightly
to
the
oaken
chair
which
stands
at
the
head
of
the
dining
room
table
was
so
firmly
bound
that
could
not
move
and
handkerchief
round
my
mouth
prevented
me
from
uttering
any
sound
it
was
at
this
instant
that
my
unfortunate
husband
entered
the
room
he
had
evidently
heard
some
suspicious
sounds
and
he
came
prepared
for
such
scene
as
he
found
he
was
dressed
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
with
his
favourite
blackthorn
cudgel
in
his
hand
he
rushed
at
one
of
the
burglars
but
another
it
was
the
elderly
man
stooped
picked
the
poker
out
of
the
grate
and
struck
him
horrible
blow
as
he
passed
he
fell
without
groan
and
never
moved
again
fainted
once
more
but
again
it
could
only
have
been
very
few
minutes
during
which
was
insensible
when
opened
my
eyes
found
that
they
had
collected
the
silver
from
the
sideboard
and
they
had
drawn
bottle
of
wine
which
stood
there
each
of
them
had
glass
in
his
hand
have
already
told
you
have
not
that
one
was
elderly
with
beard
and
the
others
young
hairless
lads
they
might
have
been
father
with
his
two
sons
they
talked
together
in
whispers
then
they
came
over
and
made
sure
that
was
still
securely
bound
finally
they
withdrew
closing
the
window
after
them
it
was
quite
quarter
of
an
hour
before
got
my
mouth
free
when
did
so
my
screams
brought
the
maid
to
my
assistance
the
other
servants
were
soon
alarmed
and
we
sent
for
the
local
police
who
instantly
communicated
with
london
that
is
really
all
that
can
tell
you
gentlemen
and
trust
that
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
me
to
go
over
so
painful
story
again

any
questions
mr
holmes
asked
hopkins
will
not
impose
any
further
tax
upon
lady
brackenstall
patience
and
time
said
holmes
before
go
into
the
dining
room
should
like
to
hear
your
experience
he
looked
at
the
maid
saw
the
men
before
ever
they
came
into
the
house
said
she
as
sat
by
my
bedroom
window
saw
three
men
in
the
moonlight
down
by
the
lodge
gate
yonder
but
thought
nothing
of
it
at
the
time
it
was
more
than
an
hour
after
that
heard
my
mistress
scream
and
down
ran
to
find
her
poor
lamb
just
as
she
says
and
him
on
the
floor
with
his
blood
and
brains
over
the
room
it
was
enough
to
drive
woman
out
of
her
wits
tied
there
and
her
very
dress
spotted
with
him
but
she
never
wanted
courage
did
miss
mary
fraser
of
adelaide
and
lady
brackenstall
of
abbey
grange
hasn
learned
new
ways
you
ve
questioned
her
long
enough
you
gentlemen
and
now
she
is
coming
to
her
own
room
just
with
her
old
theresa
to
get
the
rest
that
she
badly
needs
with
motherly
tenderness
the
gaunt
woman
put
her
arm
round
her
mistress
and
led
her
from
the
room
she
has
been
with
her
all
her
life
said
hopkins
nursed
her
as
baby
and
came
with
her
to
england
when
they
first
left
australia
eighteen
months
ago
theresa
wright
is
her
name
and
the
kind
of
maid
you
don
pick
up
nowadays
this
way
mr
holmes
if
you
please
the
keen
interest
had
passed
out
of
holmes
expressive
face
and
knew
that
with
the
mystery
all
the
charm
of
the
case
had
departed
there
still
remained
an
arrest
to
be
effected
but
what
were
these
commonplace
rogues
that
he
should
soil
his
hands
with
them
an
abstruse
and
learned
specialist
who
finds
that
he
has
been
called
in
for
case
of
measles
would
experience
something
of
the
annoyance
which
read
in
my
friend
eyes
yet
the
scene
in
the
dining
room
of
the
abbey
grange
was
sufficiently
strange
to
arrest
his
attention
and
to
recall
his
waning
interest
it
was
very
large
and
high
chamber
with
carved
oak
ceiling
oaken
panelling
and
fine
array
of
deer
heads
and
ancient
weapons
around
the
walls
at
the
farther
end
from
the
door
was
the
high
french
window
of
which
we
had
heard
three
smaller
windows
on
the
right
hand
side
filled
the
apartment
with
cold
winter
sunshine
on
the
left
was
large
deep
fireplace
with
massive
over
hanging
oak
mantelpiece
beside
the
fireplace
was
heavy
oaken
chair
with
arms
and
cross
bars
at
the
bottom
in
and
out
through
the
open
woodwork
was
woven
crimson
cord
which
was
secured
at
each
side
to
the
crosspiece
below
in
releasing
the
lady
the
cord
had
been
slipped
off
her
but
the
knots
with
which
it
had
been
secured
still
remained
these
details
only
struck
our
attention
afterwards
for
our
thoughts
were
entirely
absorbed
by
the
terrible
object
which
lay
upon
the
tiger
skin
hearthrug
in
front
of
the
fire
it
was
the
body
of
tall
well
made
man
about
forty
years
of
age
he
lay
upon
his
back
his
face
upturned
with
his
white
teeth
grinning
through
his
short
black
beard
his
two
clenched
hands
were
raised
above
his
head
and
heavy
blackthorn
stick
lay
across
them
his
dark
handsome
aquiline
features
were
convulsed
into
spasm
of
vindictive
hatred
which
had
set
his
dead
face
in
terribly
fiendish
expression
he
had
evidently
been
in
his
bed
when
the
alarm
had
broken
out
for
he
wore
foppish
embroidered
night
shirt
and
his
bare
feet
projected
from
his
trousers
his
head
was
horribly
injured
and
the
whole
room
bore
witness
to
the
savage
ferocity
of
the
blow
which
had
struck
him
down
beside
him
lay
the
heavy
poker
bent
into
curve
by
the
concussion
holmes
examined
both
it
and
the
indescribable
wreck
which
it
had
wrought
he
must
be
powerful
man
this
elder
randall
he
remarked
yes
said
hopkins
have
some
record
of
the
fellow
and
he
is
rough
customer
you
should
have
no
difficulty
in
getting
him
not
the
slightest
we
have
been
on
the
look
out
for
him
and
there
was
some
idea
that
he
had
got
away
to
america
now
that
we
know
the
gang
are
here
don
see
how
they
can
escape
we
have
the
news
at
every
seaport
already
and
reward
will
be
offered
before
evening
what
beats
me
is
how
they
could
have
done
so
mad
thing
knowing
that
the
lady
could
describe
them
and
that
we
could
not
fail
to
recognise
the
description
exactly
one
would
have
expected
that
they
would
have
silenced
lady
brackenstall
as
well
they
may
not
have
realized
suggested
that
she
had
recovered
from
her
faint
that
is
likely
enough
if
she
seemed
to
be
senseless
they
would
not
take
her
life
what
about
this
poor
fellow
hopkins
seem
to
have
heard
some
queer
stories
about
him
he
was
good
hearted
man
when
he
was
sober
but
perfect
fiend
when
he
was
drunk
or
rather
when
he
was
half
drunk
for
he
seldom
really
went
the
whole
way
the
devil
seemed
to
be
in
him
at
such
times
and
he
was
capable
of
anything
from
what
hear
in
spite
of
all
his
wealth
and
his
title
he
very
nearly
came
our
way
once
or
twice
there
was
scandal
about
his
drenching
dog
with
petroleum
and
setting
it
on
fire
her
ladyship
dog
to
make
the
matter
worse
and
that
was
only
hushed
up
with
difficulty
then
he
threw
decanter
at
that
maid
theresa
wright
there
was
trouble
about
that
on
the
whole
and
between
ourselves
it
will
be
brighter
house
without
him
what
are
you
looking
at
now
holmes
was
down
on
his
knees
examining
with
great
attention
the
knots
upon
the
red
cord
with
which
the
lady
had
been
secured
then
he
carefully
scrutinized
the
broken
and
frayed
end
where
it
had
snapped
off
when
the
burglar
had
dragged
it
down
when
this
was
pulled
down
the
bell
in
the
kitchen
must
have
rung
loudly
he
remarked
no
one
could
hear
it
the
kitchen
stands
right
at
the
back
of
the
house
how
did
the
burglar
know
no
one
would
hear
it
how
dared
he
pull
at
bell
rope
in
that
reckless
fashion
exactly
mr
holmes
exactly
you
put
the
very
question
which
have
asked
myself
again
and
again
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
fellow
must
have
known
the
house
and
its
habits
he
must
have
perfectly
understood
that
the
servants
would
all
be
in
bed
at
that
comparatively
early
hour
and
that
no
one
could
possibly
hear
bell
ring
in
the
kitchen
therefore
he
must
have
been
in
close
league
with
one
of
the
servants
surely
that
is
evident
but
there
are
eight
servants
and
all
of
good
character
other
things
being
equal
said
holmes
one
would
suspect
the
one
at
whose
head
the
master
threw
decanter
and
yet
that
would
involve
treachery
towards
the
mistress
to
whom
this
woman
seems
devoted
well
the
point
is
minor
one
and
when
you
have
randall
you
will
probably
find
no
difficulty
in
securing
his
accomplice
the
lady
story
certainly
seems
to
be
corroborated
if
it
needed
corroboration
by
every
detail
which
we
see
before
us
he
walked
to
the
french
window
and
threw
it
open
there
are
no
signs
here
but
the
ground
is
iron
hard
and
one
would
not
expect
them
see
that
these
candles
on
the
mantelpiece
have
been
lighted
yes
it
was
by
their
light
and
that
of
the
lady
bedroom
candle
that
the
burglars
saw
their
way
about
and
what
did
they
take
well
they
did
not
take
much
only
half
dozen
articles
of
plate
off
the
sideboard
lady
brackenstall
thinks
that
they
were
themselves
so
disturbed
by
the
death
of
sir
eustace
that
they
did
not
ransack
the
house
as
they
would
otherwise
have
done
no
doubt
that
is
true
and
yet
they
drank
some
wine
understand
to
steady
their
own
nerves
exactly
these
three
glasses
upon
the
sideboard
have
been
untouched
suppose
yes
and
the
bottle
stands
as
they
left
it
let
us
look
at
it
halloa
what
is
this
the
three
glasses
were
grouped
together
all
of
them
tinged
with
wine
and
one
of
them
containing
some
dregs
of
bees
wing
the
bottle
stood
near
them
two
thirds
full
and
beside
it
lay
long
deeply
stained
cork
its
appearance
and
the
dust
upon
the
bottle
showed
that
it
was
no
common
vintage
which
the
murderers
had
enjoyed
change
had
come
over
holmes
manner
he
had
lost
his
listless
expression
and
again
saw
an
alert
light
of
interest
in
his
keen
deep
set
eyes
he
raised
the
cork
and
examined
it
minutely
how
did
they
draw
it
he
asked
hopkins
pointed
to
half
opened
drawer
in
it
lay
some
table
linen
and
large
cork
screw
did
lady
brackenstall
say
that
screw
was
used
no
you
remember
that
she
was
senseless
at
the
moment
when
the
bottle
was
opened
quite
so
as
matter
of
fact
that
screw
was
not
used
this
bottle
was
opened
by
pocket
screw
probably
contained
in
knife
and
not
more
than
an
inch
and
half
long
if
you
examine
the
top
of
the
cork
you
will
observe
that
the
screw
was
driven
in
three
times
before
the
cork
was
extracted
it
has
never
been
transfixed
this
long
screw
would
have
transfixed
it
and
drawn
it
with
single
pull
when
you
catch
this
fellow
you
will
find
that
he
has
one
of
these
multiplex
knives
in
his
possession

excellent
said
hopkins
but
these
glasses
do
puzzle
me
confess
lady
brackenstall
actually
saw
the
three
men
drinking
did
she
not
yes
she
was
clear
about
that
then
there
is
an
end
of
it
what
more
is
to
be
said
and
yet
you
must
admit
that
the
three
glasses
are
very
remarkable
hopkins
what
you
see
nothing
remarkable
well
let
it
pass
perhaps
when
man
has
special
knowledge
and
special
powers
like
my
own
it
rather
encourages
him
to
seek
complex
explanation
when
simpler
one
is
at
hand
of
course
it
must
be
mere
chance
about
the
glasses
well
good
morning
hopkins
don
see
that
can
be
of
any
use
to
you
and
you
appear
to
have
your
case
very
clear
you
will
let
me
know
when
randall
is
arrested
and
any
further
developments
which
may
occur
trust
that
shall
soon
have
to
congratulate
you
upon
successful
conclusion
come
watson
fancy
that
we
may
employ
ourselves
more
profitably
at
home
during
our
return
journey
could
see
by
holmes
face
that
he
was
much
puzzled
by
something
which
he
had
observed
every
now
and
then
by
an
effort
he
would
throw
off
the
impression
and
talk
as
if
the
matter
were
clear
but
then
his
doubts
would
settle
down
upon
him
again
and
his
knitted
brows
and
abstracted
eyes
would
show
that
his
thoughts
had
gone
back
once
more
to
the
great
dining
room
of
the
abbey
grange
in
which
this
midnight
tragedy
had
been
enacted
at
last
by
sudden
impulse
just
as
our
train
was
crawling
out
of
suburban
station
he
sprang
on
to
the
platform
and
pulled
me
out
after
him
excuse
me
my
dear
fellow
said
he
as
we
watched
the
rear
carriages
of
our
train
disappearing
round
curve
am
sorry
to
make
you
the
victim
of
what
may
seem
mere
whim
but
on
my
life
watson
simply
can
leave
that
case
in
this
condition
every
instinct
that
possess
cries
out
against
it
wrong
it
all
wrong
ll
swear
that
it
wrong
and
yet
the
lady
story
was
complete
the
maid
corroboration
was
sufficient
the
detail
was
fairly
exact
what
have
to
put
against
that
three
wine
glasses
that
is
all
but
if
had
not
taken
things
for
granted
if
had
examined
everything
with
care
which
would
have
shown
had
we
approached
the
case
de
novo
and
had
no
cut
and
dried
story
to
warp
my
mind
would
not
then
have
found
something
more
definite
to
go
upon
of
course
should
sit
down
on
this
bench
watson
until
train
for
chislehurst
arrives
and
allow
me
to
lay
the
evidence
before
you
imploring
you
in
the
first
instance
to
dismiss
from
your
mind
the
idea
that
anything
which
the
maid
or
her
mistress
may
have
said
must
necessarily
be
true
the
lady
charming
personality
must
not
be
permitted
to
warp
our
judgment
surely
there
are
details
in
her
story
which
if
we
looked
at
it
in
cold
blood
would
excite
our
suspicion
these
burglars
made
considerable
haul
at
sydenham
fortnight
ago
some
account
of
them
and
of
their
appearance
was
in
the
papers
and
would
naturally
occur
to
anyone
who
wished
to
invent
story
in
which
imaginary
robbers
should
play
part
as
matter
of
fact
burglars
who
have
done
good
stroke
of
business
are
as
rule
only
too
glad
to
enjoy
the
proceeds
in
peace
and
quiet
without
embarking
on
another
perilous
undertaking
again
it
is
unusual
for
burglars
to
operate
at
so
early
an
hour
it
is
unusual
for
burglars
to
strike
lady
to
prevent
her
screaming
since
one
would
imagine
that
was
the
sure
way
to
make
her
scream
it
is
unusual
for
them
to
commit
murder
when
their
numbers
are
sufficient
to
overpower
one
man
it
is
unusual
for
them
to
be
content
with
limited
plunder
when
there
is
much
more
within
their
reach
and
finally
should
say
that
it
was
very
unusual
for
such
men
to
leave
bottle
half
empty
how
do
all
these
unusuals
strike
you
watson
their
cumulative
effect
is
certainly
considerable
and
yet
each
of
them
is
quite
possible
in
itself
the
most
unusual
thing
of
all
as
it
seems
to
me
is
that
the
lady
should
be
tied
to
the
chair
well
am
not
so
clear
about
that
watson
for
it
is
evident
that
they
must
either
kill
her
or
else
secure
her
in
such
way
that
she
could
not
give
immediate
notice
of
their
escape
but
at
any
rate
have
shown
have
not
that
there
is
certain
element
of
improbability
about
the
lady
story
and
now
on
the
top
of
this
comes
the
incident
of
the
wine
glasses
what
about
the
wine
glasses
can
you
see
them
in
your
mind
eye
see
them
clearly
we
are
told
that
three
men
drank
from
them
does
that
strike
you
as
likely
why
not
there
was
wine
in
each
glass
exactly
but
there
was
bees
wing
only
in
one
glass
you
must
have
noticed
that
fact
what
does
that
suggest
to
your
mind
the
last
glass
filled
would
be
most
likely
to
contain
bees
wing
not
at
all
the
bottle
was
full
of
it
and
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
first
two
glasses
were
clear
and
the
third
heavily
charged
with
it
there
are
two
possible
explanations
and
only
two
one
is
that
after
the
second
glass
was
filled
the
bottle
was
violently
agitated
and
so
the
third
glass
received
the
bees
wing
that
does
not
appear
probable
no
am
sure
that
am
right
what
then
do
you
suppose
that
only
two
glasses
were
used
and
that
the
dregs
of
both
were
poured
into
third
glass
so
as
to
give
the
false
impression
that
three
people
had
been
here
in
that
way
all
the
bees
wing
would
be
in
the
last
glass
would
it
not
yes
am
convinced
that
this
is
so
but
if
have
hit
upon
the
true
explanation
of
this
one
small
phenomenon
then
in
an
instant
the
case
rises
from
the
commonplace
to
the
exceedingly
remarkable
for
it
can
only
mean
that
lady
brackenstall
and
her
maid
have
deliberately
lied
to
us
that
not
one
word
of
their
story
is
to
be
believed
that
they
have
some
very
strong
reason
for
covering
the
real
criminal
and
that
we
must
construct
our
case
for
ourselves
without
any
help
from
them
that
is
the
mission
which
now
lies
before
us
and
here
watson
is
the
chislehurst
train
the
household
of
the
abbey
grange
were
much
surprised
at
our
return
but
sherlock
holmes
finding
that
stanley
hopkins
had
gone
off
to
report
to
head
quarters
took
possession
of
the
dining
room
locked
the
door
upon
the
inside
and
devoted
himself
for
two
hours
to
one
of
those
minute
and
laborious
investigations
which
formed
the
solid
basis
on
which
his
brilliant
edifices
of
deduction
were
reared
seated
in
corner
like
an
interested
student
who
observes
the
demonstration
of
his
professor
followed
every
step
of
that
remarkable
research
the
window
the
curtains
the
carpet
the
chair
the
rope
each
in
turn
was
minutely
examined
and
duly
pondered
the
body
of
the
unfortunate
baronet
had
been
removed
but
all
else
remained
as
we
had
seen
it
in
the
morning
then
to
my
astonishment
holmes
climbed
up
on
to
the
massive
mantelpiece
far
above
his
head
hung
the
few
inches
of
red
cord
which
were
still
attached
to
the
wire
for
long
time
he
gazed
upward
at
it
and
then
in
an
attempt
to
get
nearer
to
it
he
rested
his
knee
upon
wooden
bracket
on
the
wall
this
brought
his
hand
within
few
inches
of
the
broken
end
of
the
rope
but
it
was
not
this
so
much
as
the
bracket
itself
which
seemed
to
engage
his
attention
finally
he
sprang
down
with
an
ejaculation
of
satisfaction
it
all
right
watson
said
he
we
have
got
our
case
one
of
the
most
remarkable
in
our
collection
but
dear
me
how
slow
witted
have
been
and
how
nearly
have
committed
the
blunder
of
my
lifetime
now
think
that
with
few
missing
links
my
chain
is
almost
complete
you
have
got
your
men
man
watson
man
only
one
but
very
formidable
person
strong
as
lion
witness
the
blow
that
bent
that
poker
six
foot
three
in
height
active
as
squirrel
dexterous
with
his
fingers
finally
remarkably
quick
witted
for
this
whole
ingenious
story
is
of
his
concoction
yes
watson
we
have
come
upon
the
handiwork
of
very
remarkable
individual
and
yet
in
that
bell
rope
he
has
given
us
clue
which
should
not
have
left
us
doubt
where
was
the
clue
well
if
you
were
to
pull
down
bell
rope
watson
where
would
you
expect
it
to
break
surely
at
the
spot
where
it
is
attached
to
the
wire
why
should
it
break
three
inches
from
the
top
as
this
one
has
done
because
it
is
frayed
there
exactly
this
end
which
we
can
examine
is
frayed
he
was
cunning
enough
to
do
that
with
his
knife
but
the
other
end
is
not
frayed
you
could
not
observe
that
from
here
but
if
you
were
on
the
mantelpiece
you
would
see
that
it
is
cut
clean
off
without
any
mark
of
fraying
whatever
you
can
reconstruct
what
occurred
the
man
needed
the
rope
he
would
not
tear
it
down
for
fear
of
giving
the
alarm
by
ringing
the
bell
what
did
he
do
he
sprang
up
on
the
mantelpiece
could
not
quite
reach
it
put
his
knee
on
the
bracket
you
will
see
the
impression
in
the
dust
and
so
got
his
knife
to
bear
upon
the
cord
could
not
reach
the
place
by
at
least
three
inches
from
which
infer
that
he
is
at
least
three
inches
bigger
man
than
look
at
that
mark
upon
the
seat
of
the
oaken
chair

blood
undoubtedly
it
is
blood
this
alone
puts
the
lady
story
out
of
court
if
she
were
seated
on
the
chair
when
the
crime
was
done
how
comes
that
mark
no
she
was
placed
in
the
chair
after
the
death
of
her
husband
ll
wager
that
the
black
dress
shows
corresponding
mark
to
this
we
have
not
yet
met
our
waterloo
watson
but
this
is
our
marengo
for
it
begins
in
defeat
and
ends
in
victory
should
like
now
to
have
few
words
with
the
nurse
theresa
we
must
be
wary
for
awhile
if
we
are
to
get
the
information
which
we
want
she
was
an
interesting
person
this
stern
australian
nurse
taciturn
suspicious
ungracious
it
took
some
time
before
holmes
pleasant
manner
and
frank
acceptance
of
all
that
she
said
thawed
her
into
corresponding
amiability
she
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
her
hatred
for
her
late
employer
yes
sir
it
is
true
that
he
threw
the
decanter
at
me
heard
him
call
my
mistress
name
and
told
him
that
he
would
not
dare
to
speak
so
if
her
brother
had
been
there
then
it
was
that
he
threw
it
at
me
he
might
have
thrown
dozen
if
he
had
but
left
my
bonny
bird
alone
he
was
for
ever
illtreating
her
and
she
too
proud
to
complain
she
will
not
even
tell
me
all
that
he
has
done
to
her
she
never
told
me
of
those
marks
on
her
arm
that
you
saw
this
morning
but
know
very
well
that
they
come
from
stab
with
hat
pin
the
sly
fiend
heaven
forgive
me
that
should
speak
of
him
so
now
that
he
is
dead
but
fiend
he
was
if
ever
one
walked
the
earth
he
was
all
honey
when
first
we
met
him
only
eighteen
months
ago
and
we
both
feel
as
if
it
were
eighteen
years
she
had
only
just
arrived
in
london
yes
it
was
her
first
voyage
she
had
never
been
from
home
before
he
won
her
with
his
title
and
his
money
and
his
false
london
ways
if
she
made
mistake
she
has
paid
for
it
if
ever
woman
did
what
month
did
we
meet
him
well
tell
you
it
was
just
after
we
arrived
we
arrived
in
june
and
it
was
july
they
were
married
in
january
of
last
year
yes
she
is
down
in
the
morning
room
again
and
have
no
doubt
she
will
see
you
but
you
must
not
ask
too
much
of
her
for
she
has
gone
through
all
that
flesh
and
blood
will
stand
lady
brackenstall
was
reclining
on
the
same
couch
but
looked
brighter
than
before
the
maid
had
entered
with
us
and
began
once
more
to
foment
the
bruise
upon
her
mistress
brow
hope
said
the
lady
that
you
have
not
come
to
cross
examine
me
again
no
holmes
answered
in
his
gentlest
voice
will
not
cause
you
any
unnecessary
trouble
lady
brackenstall
and
my
whole
desire
is
to
make
things
easy
for
you
for
am
convinced
that
you
are
much
tried
woman
if
you
will
treat
me
as
friend
and
trust
me
you
may
find
that
will
justify
your
trust
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
to
tell
me
the
truth
mr
holmes
no
lady
brackenstall
it
is
no
use
you
may
have
heard
of
any
little
reputation
which
possess
will
stake
it
all
on
the
fact
that
your
story
is
an
absolute
fabrication
mistress
and
maid
were
both
staring
at
holmes
with
pale
faces
and
frightened
eyes
you
are
an
impudent
fellow
cried
theresa
do
you
mean
to
say
that
my
mistress
has
told
lie
holmes
rose
from
his
chair
have
you
nothing
to
tell
me
have
told
you
everything
think
once
more
lady
brackenstall
would
it
not
be
better
to
be
frank
for
an
instant
there
was
hesitation
in
her
beautiful
face
then
some
new
strong
thought
caused
it
to
set
like
mask
have
told
you
all
know
holmes
took
his
hat
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
am
sorry
he
said
and
without
another
word
we
left
the
room
and
the
house
there
was
pond
in
the
park
and
to
this
my
friend
led
the
way
it
was
frozen
over
but
single
hole
was
left
for
the
convenience
of
solitary
swan
holmes
gazed
at
it
and
then
passed
on
to
the
lodge
gate
there
he
scribbled
short
note
for
stanley
hopkins
and
left
it
with
the
lodge
keeper
it
may
be
hit
or
it
may
be
miss
but
we
are
bound
to
do
something
for
friend
hopkins
just
to
justify
this
second
visit
said
he
will
not
quite
take
him
into
my
confidence
yet
think
our
next
scene
of
operations
must
be
the
shipping
office
of
the
adelaide
southampton
line
which
stands
at
the
end
of
pall
mall
if
remember
right
there
is
second
line
of
steamers
which
connect
south
australia
with
england
but
we
will
draw
the
larger
cover
first
holmes
card
sent
in
to
the
manager
ensured
instant
attention
and
he
was
not
long
in
acquiring
all
the
information
which
he
needed
in
june
of
95
only
one
of
their
line
had
reached
home
port
it
was
the
rock
of
gibraltar
their
largest
and
best
boat
reference
to
the
passenger
list
showed
that
miss
fraser
of
adelaide
with
her
maid
had
made
the
voyage
in
her
the
boat
was
now
on
her
way
to
australia
somewhere
to
the
south
of
the
suez
canal
her
officers
were
the
same
as
in
95
with
one
exception
the
first
officer
mr
jack
croker
had
been
made
captain
and
was
to
take
charge
of
their
new
ship
the
bass
rock
sailing
in
two
days
time
from
southampton
he
lived
at
sydenham
but
he
was
likely
to
be
in
that
morning
for
instructions
if
we
cared
to
wait
for
him
no
mr
holmes
had
no
desire
to
see
him
but
would
be
glad
to
know
more
about
his
record
and
character
his
record
was
magnificent
there
was
not
an
officer
in
the
fleet
to
touch
him
as
to
his
character
he
was
reliable
on
duty
but
wild
desperate
fellow
off
the
deck
of
his
ship
hot
headed
excitable
but
loyal
honest
and
kind
hearted
that
was
the
pith
of
the
information
with
which
holmes
left
the
office
of
the
adelaide
southampton
company
thence
he
drove
to
scotland
yard
but
instead
of
entering
he
sat
in
his
cab
with
his
brows
drawn
down
lost
in
profound
thought
finally
he
drove
round
to
the
charing
cross
telegraph
office
sent
off
message
and
then
at
last
we
made
for
baker
street
once
more
no
couldn
do
it
watson
said
he
as
we
re
entered
our
room
once
that
warrant
was
made
out
nothing
on
earth
would
save
him
once
or
twice
in
my
career
feel
that
have
done
more
real
harm
by
my
discovery
of
the
criminal
than
ever
he
had
done
by
his
crime
have
learned
caution
now
and
had
rather
play
tricks
with
the
law
of
england
than
with
my
own
conscience
let
us
know
little
more
before
we
act
before
evening
we
had
visit
from
inspector
stanley
hopkins
things
were
not
going
very
well
with
him
believe
that
you
are
wizard
mr
holmes
really
do
sometimes
think
that
you
have
powers
that
are
not
human
now
how
on
earth
could
you
know
that
the
stolen
silver
was
at
the
bottom
of
that
pond
didn
know
it
but
you
told
me
to
examine
it
you
got
it
then
yes
got
it
am
very
glad
if
have
helped
you
but
you
haven
helped
me
you
have
made
the
affair
far
more
difficult
what
sort
of
burglars
are
they
who
steal
silver
and
then
throw
it
into
the
nearest
pond
it
was
certainly
rather
eccentric
behaviour
was
merely
going
on
the
idea
that
if
the
silver
had
been
taken
by
persons
who
did
not
want
it
who
merely
took
it
for
blind
as
it
were
then
they
would
naturally
be
anxious
to
get
rid
of
it
but
why
should
such
an
idea
cross
your
mind
well
thought
it
was
possible
when
they
came
out
through
the
french
window
there
was
the
pond
with
one
tempting
little
hole
in
the
ice
right
in
front
of
their
noses
could
there
be
better
hiding
place
ah
hiding
place
that
is
better
cried
stanley
hopkins
yes
see
it
all
now
it
was
early
there
were
folk
upon
the
roads
they
were
afraid
of
being
seen
with
the
silver
so
they
sank
it
in
the
pond
intending
to
return
for
it
when
the
coast
was
clear
excellent
mr
holmes
that
is
better
than
your
idea
of
blind
quite
so
you
have
got
an
admirable
theory
have
no
doubt
that
my
own
ideas
were
quite
wild
but
you
must
admit
that
they
have
ended
in
discovering
the
silver
yes
sir
yes
it
was
all
your
doing
but
have
had
bad
set
back
set
back
yes
mr
holmes
the
randall
gang
were
arrested
in
new
york
this
morning
dear
me
hopkins
that
is
certainly
rather
against
your
theory
that
they
committed
murder
in
kent
last
night
it
is
fatal
mr
holmes
absolutely
fatal
still
there
are
other
gangs
of
three
besides
the
randalls
or
it
may
be
some
new
gang
of
which
the
police
have
never
heard
quite
so
it
is
perfectly
possible
what
are
you
off
yes
mr
holmes
there
is
no
rest
for
me
until
have
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
business
suppose
you
have
no
hint
to
give
me
have
given
you
one
which
well
suggested
blind
but
why
mr
holmes
why
ah
that
the
question
of
course
but
commend
the
idea
to
your
mind
you
might
possibly
find
that
there
was
something
in
it
you
won
stop
for
dinner
well
good
bye
and
let
us
know
how
you
get

dinner
was
over
and
the
table
cleared
before
holmes
alluded
to
the
matter
again
he
had
lit
his
pipe
and
held
his
slippered
feet
to
the
cheerful
blaze
of
the
fire
suddenly
he
looked
at
his
watch
expect
developments
watson
when
now
within
few
minutes
dare
say
you
thought
acted
rather
badly
to
stanley
hopkins
just
now
trust
your
judgment
very
sensible
reply
watson
you
must
look
at
it
this
way
what
know
is
unofficial
what
he
knows
is
official
have
the
right
to
private
judgment
but
he
has
none
he
must
disclose
all
or
he
is
traitor
to
his
service
in
doubtful
case
would
not
put
him
in
so
painful
position
and
so
reserve
my
information
until
my
own
mind
is
clear
upon
the
matter
but
when
will
that
be
the
time
has
come
you
will
now
be
present
at
the
last
scene
of
remarkable
little
drama
there
was
sound
upon
the
stairs
and
our
door
was
opened
to
admit
as
fine
specimen
of
manhood
as
ever
passed
through
it
he
was
very
tall
young
man
golden
moustached
blue
eyed
with
skin
which
had
been
burned
by
tropical
suns
and
springy
step
which
showed
that
the
huge
frame
was
as
active
as
it
was
strong
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
then
he
stood
with
clenched
hands
and
heaving
breast
choking
down
some
overmastering
emotion
sit
down
captain
croker
you
got
my
telegram
our
visitor
sank
into
an
arm
chair
and
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
with
questioning
eyes
got
your
telegram
and
came
at
the
hour
you
said
heard
that
you
had
been
down
to
the
office
there
was
no
getting
away
from
you
let
hear
the
worst
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
arrest
me
speak
out
man
you
can
sit
there
and
play
with
me
like
cat
with
mouse
give
him
cigar
said
holmes
bite
on
that
captain
croker
and
don
let
your
nerves
run
away
with
you
should
not
sit
here
smoking
with
you
if
thought
that
you
were
common
criminal
you
may
be
sure
of
that
be
frank
with
me
and
we
may
do
some
good
play
tricks
with
me
and
ll
crush
you
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
to
give
me
true
account
of
all
that
happened
at
the
abbey
grange
last
night
true
account
mind
you
with
nothing
added
and
nothing
taken
off
know
so
much
already
that
if
you
go
one
inch
off
the
straight
ll
blow
this
police
whistle
from
my
window
and
the
affair
goes
out
of
my
hands
for
ever
the
sailor
thought
for
little
then
he
struck
his
leg
with
his
great
sun
burned
hand
ll
chance
it
he
cried
believe
you
are
man
of
your
word
and
white
man
and
ll
tell
you
the
whole
story
but
one
thing
will
say
first
so
far
as
am
concerned
regret
nothing
and
fear
nothing
and
would
do
it
all
again
and
be
proud
of
the
job
curse
the
beast
if
he
had
as
many
lives
as
cat
he
would
owe
them
all
to
me
but
it
the
lady
mary
fraser
for
never
will
call
her
by
that
accursed
name
when
think
of
getting
her
into
trouble
who
would
give
my
life
just
to
bring
one
smile
to
her
dear
face
it
that
turns
my
soul
into
water
and
yet
and
yet
what
less
could
do
ll
tell
you
my
story
gentlemen
and
then
ll
ask
you
as
man
to
man
what
less
could
do
must
go
back
bit
you
seem
to
know
everything
so
expect
that
you
know
that
met
her
when
she
was
passenger
and
was
first
officer
of
the
rock
of
gibraltar
from
the
first
day
met
her
she
was
the
only
woman
to
me
every
day
of
that
voyage
loved
her
more
and
many
time
since
have
kneeled
down
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
watch
and
kissed
the
deck
of
that
ship
because
knew
her
dear
feet
had
trod
it
she
was
never
engaged
to
me
she
treated
me
as
fairly
as
ever
woman
treated
man
have
no
complaint
to
make
it
was
all
love
on
my
side
and
all
good
comradeship
and
friendship
on
hers
when
we
parted
she
was
free
woman
but
could
never
again
be
free
man
next
time
came
back
from
sea
heard
of
her
marriage
well
why
shouldn
she
marry
whom
she
liked
title
and
money
who
could
carry
them
better
than
she
was
born
for
all
that
is
beautiful
and
dainty
didn
grieve
over
her
marriage
was
not
such
selfish
hound
as
that
just
rejoiced
that
good
luck
had
come
her
way
and
that
she
had
not
thrown
herself
away
on
penniless
sailor
that
how
loved
mary
fraser
well
never
thought
to
see
her
again
but
last
voyage
was
promoted
and
the
new
boat
was
not
yet
launched
so
had
to
wait
for
couple
of
months
with
my
people
at
sydenham
one
day
out
in
country
lane
met
theresa
wright
her
old
maid
she
told
me
about
her
about
him
about
everything
tell
you
gentlemen
it
nearly
drove
me
mad
this
drunken
hound
that
he
should
dare
to
raise
his
hand
to
her
whose
boots
he
was
not
worthy
to
lick
met
theresa
again
then
met
mary
herself
and
met
her
again
then
she
would
meet
me
no
more
but
the
other
day
had
notice
that
was
to
start
on
my
voyage
within
week
and
determined
that
would
see
her
once
before
left
theresa
was
always
my
friend
for
she
loved
mary
and
hated
this
villain
almost
as
much
as
did
from
her
learned
the
ways
of
the
house
mary
used
to
sit
up
reading
in
her
own
little
room
downstairs
crept
round
there
last
night
and
scratched
at
the
window
at
first
she
would
not
open
to
me
but
in
her
heart
know
that
now
she
loves
me
and
she
could
not
leave
me
in
the
frosty
night
she
whispered
to
me
to
come
round
to
the
big
front
window
and
found
it
open
before
me
so
as
to
let
me
into
the
dining
room
again
heard
from
her
own
lips
things
that
made
my
blood
boil
and
again
cursed
this
brute
who
mishandled
the
woman
that
loved
well
gentlemen
was
standing
with
her
just
inside
the
window
in
all
innocence
as
heaven
is
my
judge
when
he
rushed
like
madman
into
the
room
called
her
the
vilest
name
that
man
could
use
to
woman
and
welted
her
across
the
face
with
the
stick
he
had
in
his
hand
had
sprung
for
the
poker
and
it
was
fair
fight
between
us
see
here
on
my
arm
where
his
first
blow
fell
then
it
was
my
turn
and
went
through
him
as
if
he
had
been
rotten
pumpkin
do
you
think
was
sorry
not
it
was
his
life
or
mine
but
far
more
than
that
it
was
his
life
or
hers
for
how
could
leave
her
in
the
power
of
this
madman
that
was
how
killed
him
was
wrong
well
then
what
would
either
of
you
gentlemen
have
done
if
you
had
been
in
my
position
she
had
screamed
when
he
struck
her
and
that
brought
old
theresa
down
from
the
room
above
there
was
bottle
of
wine
on
the
sideboard
and
opened
it
and
poured
little
between
mary
lips
for
she
was
half
dead
with
the
shock
then
took
drop
myself
theresa
was
as
cool
as
ice
and
it
was
her
plot
as
much
as
mine
we
must
make
it
appear
that
burglars
had
done
the
thing
theresa
kept
on
repeating
our
story
to
her
mistress
while
swarmed
up
and
cut
the
rope
of
the
bell
then
lashed
her
in
her
chair
and
frayed
out
the
end
of
the
rope
to
make
it
look
natural
else
they
would
wonder
how
in
the
world
burglar
could
have
got
up
there
to
cut
it
then
gathered
up
few
plates
and
pots
of
silver
to
carry
out
the
idea
of
robbery
and
there
left
them
with
orders
to
give
the
alarm
when
had
quarter
of
an
hour
start
dropped
the
silver
into
the
pond
and
made
off
for
sydenham
feeling
that
for
once
in
my
life
had
done
real
good
night
work
and
that
the
truth
and
the
whole
truth
mr
holmes
if
it
costs
me
my
neck
holmes
smoked
for
some
time
in
silence
then
he
crossed
the
room
and
shook
our
visitor
by
the
hand
that
what
think
said
he
know
that
every
word
is
true
for
you
have
hardly
said
word
which
did
not
know
no
one
but
an
acrobat
or
sailor
could
have
got
up
to
that
bell
rope
from
the
bracket
and
no
one
but
sailor
could
have
made
the
knots
with
which
the
cord
was
fastened
to
the
chair
only
once
had
this
lady
been
brought
into
contact
with
sailors
and
that
was
on
her
voyage
and
it
was
someone
of
her
own
class
of
life
since
she
was
trying
hard
to
shield
him
and
so
showing
that
she
loved
him
you
see
how
easy
it
was
for
me
to
lay
my
hands
upon
you
when
once
had
started
upon
the
right
trail
thought
the
police
never
could
have
seen
through
our
dodge
and
the
police
haven
nor
will
they
to
the
best
of
my
belief
now
look
here
captain
croker
this
is
very
serious
matter
though
am
willing
to
admit
that
you
acted
under
the
most
extreme
provocation
to
which
any
man
could
be
subjected
am
not
sure
that
in
defence
of
your
own
life
your
action
will
not
be
pronounced
legitimate
however
that
is
for
british
jury
to
decide
meanwhile
have
so
much
sympathy
for
you
that
if
you
choose
to
disappear
in
the
next
twenty
four
hours
will
promise
you
that
no
one
will
hinder
you
and
then
it
will
all
come
out
certainly
it
will
come
out
the
sailor
flushed
with
anger
what
sort
of
proposal
is
that
to
make
man
know
enough
of
law
to
understand
that
mary
would
be
had
as
accomplice
do
you
think
would
leave
her
alone
to
face
the
music
while
slunk
away
no
sir
let
them
do
their
worst
upon
me
but
for
heaven
sake
mr
holmes
find
some
way
of
keeping
my
poor
mary
out
of
the
courts

holmes
for
second
time
held
out
his
hand
to
the
sailor
was
only
testing
you
and
you
ring
true
every
time
well
it
is
great
responsibility
that
take
upon
myself
but
have
given
hopkins
an
excellent
hint
and
if
he
can
avail
himself
of
it
can
do
no
more
see
here
captain
croker
we
ll
do
this
in
due
form
of
law
you
are
the
prisoner
watson
you
are
british
jury
and
never
met
man
who
was
more
eminently
fitted
to
represent
one
am
the
judge
now
gentleman
of
the
jury
you
have
heard
the
evidence
do
you
find
the
prisoner
guilty
or
not
guilty
not
guilty
my
lord
said
vox
populi
vox
dei
you
are
acquitted
captain
croker
so
long
as
the
law
does
not
find
some
other
victim
you
are
safe
from
me
come
back
to
this
lady
in
year
and
may
her
future
and
yours
justify
us
in
the
judgment
which
we
have
pronounced
this
night
xiii
the
adventure
of
the
second
stain
had
intended
the
adventure
of
the
abbey
grange
to
be
the
last
of
those
exploits
of
my
friend
mr
sherlock
holmes
which
should
ever
communicate
to
the
public
this
resolution
of
mine
was
not
due
to
any
lack
of
material
since
have
notes
of
many
hundreds
of
cases
to
which
have
never
alluded
nor
was
it
caused
by
any
waning
interest
on
the
part
of
my
readers
in
the
singular
personality
and
unique
methods
of
this
remarkable
man
the
real
reason
lay
in
the
reluctance
which
mr
holmes
has
shown
to
the
continued
publication
of
his
experiences
so
long
as
he
was
in
actual
professional
practice
the
records
of
his
successes
were
of
some
practical
value
to
him
but
since
he
has
definitely
retired
from
london
and
betaken
himself
to
study
and
bee
farming
on
the
sussex
downs
notoriety
has
become
hateful
to
him
and
he
has
peremptorily
requested
that
his
wishes
in
this
matter
should
be
strictly
observed
it
was
only
upon
my
representing
to
him
that
had
given
promise
that
the
adventure
of
the
second
stain
should
be
published
when
the
times
were
ripe
and
pointing
out
to
him
that
it
is
only
appropriate
that
this
long
series
of
episodes
should
culminate
in
the
most
important
international
case
which
he
has
ever
been
called
upon
to
handle
that
at
last
succeeded
in
obtaining
his
consent
that
carefully
guarded
account
of
the
incident
should
at
last
be
laid
before
the
public
if
in
telling
the
story
seem
to
be
somewhat
vague
in
certain
details
the
public
will
readily
understand
that
there
is
an
excellent
reason
for
my
reticence
it
was
then
in
year
and
even
in
decade
that
shall
be
nameless
that
upon
one
tuesday
morning
in
autumn
we
found
two
visitors
of
european
fame
within
the
walls
of
our
humble
room
in
baker
street
the
one
austere
high
nosed
eagle
eyed
and
dominant
was
none
other
than
the
illustrious
lord
bellinger
twice
premier
of
britain
the
other
dark
clear
cut
and
elegant
hardly
yet
of
middle
age
and
endowed
with
every
beauty
of
body
and
of
mind
was
the
right
honourable
trelawney
hope
secretary
for
european
affairs
and
the
most
rising
statesman
in
the
country
they
sat
side
by
side
upon
our
paper
littered
settee
and
it
was
easy
to
see
from
their
worn
and
anxious
faces
that
it
was
business
of
the
most
pressing
importance
which
had
brought
them
the
premier
thin
blue
veined
hands
were
clasped
tightly
over
the
ivory
head
of
his
umbrella
and
his
gaunt
ascetic
face
looked
gloomily
from
holmes
to
me
the
european
secretary
pulled
nervously
at
his
moustache
and
fidgeted
with
the
seals
of
his
watch
chain
when
discovered
my
loss
mr
holmes
which
was
at
eight
clock
this
morning
at
once
informed
the
prime
minister
it
was
at
his
suggestion
that
we
have
both
come
to
you
have
you
informed
the
police
no
sir
said
the
prime
minister
with
the
quick
decisive
manner
for
which
he
was
famous
we
have
not
done
so
nor
is
it
possible
that
we
should
do
so
to
inform
the
police
must
in
the
long
run
mean
to
inform
the
public
this
is
what
we
particularly
desire
to
avoid
and
why
sir
because
the
document
in
question
is
of
such
immense
importance
that
its
publication
might
very
easily
might
almost
say
probably
lead
to
european
complications
of
the
utmost
moment
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
peace
or
war
may
hang
upon
the
issue
unless
its
recovery
can
be
attended
with
the
utmost
secrecy
then
it
may
as
well
not
be
recovered
at
all
for
all
that
is
aimed
at
by
those
who
have
taken
it
is
that
its
contents
should
be
generally
known
understand
now
mr
trelawney
hope
should
be
much
obliged
if
you
would
tell
me
exactly
the
circumstances
under
which
this
document
disappeared
that
can
be
done
in
very
few
words
mr
holmes
the
letter
for
it
was
letter
from
foreign
potentate
was
received
six
days
ago
it
was
of
such
importance
that
have
never
left
it
in
my
safe
but
have
taken
it
across
each
evening
to
my
house
in
whitehall
terrace
and
kept
it
in
my
bedroom
in
locked
despatch
box
it
was
there
last
night
of
that
am
certain
actually
opened
the
box
while
was
dressing
for
dinner
and
saw
the
document
inside
this
morning
it
was
gone
the
despatch
box
had
stood
beside
the
glass
upon
my
dressing
table
all
night
am
light
sleeper
and
so
is
my
wife
we
are
both
prepared
to
swear
that
no
one
could
have
entered
the
room
during
the
night
and
yet
repeat
that
the
paper
is
gone
what
time
did
you
dine
half
past
seven
how
long
was
it
before
you
went
to
bed
my
wife
had
gone
to
the
theatre
waited
up
for
her
it
was
half
past
eleven
before
we
went
to
our
room
then
for
four
hours
the
despatch
box
had
lain
unguarded
no
one
is
ever
permitted
to
enter
that
room
save
the
housemaid
in
the
morning
and
my
valet
or
my
wife
maid
during
the
rest
of
the
day
they
are
both
trusty
servants
who
have
been
with
us
for
some
time
besides
neither
of
them
could
possibly
have
known
that
there
was
anything
more
valuable
than
the
ordinary
departmental
papers
in
my
despatch
box
who
did
know
of
the
existence
of
that
letter
no
one
in
the
house
surely
your
wife
knew
no
sir
had
said
nothing
to
my
wife
until
missed
the
paper
this
morning
the
premier
nodded
approvingly
have
long
known
sir
how
high
is
your
sense
of
public
duty
said
he
am
convinced
that
in
the
case
of
secret
of
this
importance
it
would
rise
superior
to
the
most
intimate
domestic
ties
the
european
secretary
bowed
you
do
me
no
more
than
justice
sir
until
this
morning
have
never
breathed
one
word
to
my
wife
upon
this
matter
could
she
have
guessed
no
mr
holmes
she
could
not
have
guessed
nor
could
anyone
have
guessed
have
you
lost
any
documents
before
no
sir
who
is
there
in
england
who
did
know
of
the
existence
of
this
letter
each
member
of
the
cabinet
was
informed
of
it
yesterday
but
the
pledge
of
secrecy
which
attends
every
cabinet
meeting
was
increased
by
the
solemn
warning
which
was
given
by
the
prime
minister
good
heavens
to
think
that
within
few
hours
should
myself
have
lost
it
his
handsome
face
was
distorted
with
spasm
of
despair
and
his
hands
tore
at
his
hair
for
moment
we
caught
glimpse
of
the
natural
man
impulsive
ardent
keenly
sensitive
the
next
the
aristocratic
mask
was
replaced
and
the
gentle
voice
had
returned
besides
the
members
of
the
cabinet
there
are
two
or
possibly
three
departmental
officials
who
know
of
the
letter
no
one
else
in
england
mr
holmes
assure
you
but
abroad
believe
that
no
one
abroad
has
seen
it
save
the
man
who
wrote
it
am
well
convinced
that
his
ministers
that
the
usual
official
channels
have
not
been
employed
holmes
considered
for
some
little
time
now
sir
must
ask
you
more
particularly
what
this
document
is
and
why
its
disappearance
should
have
such
momentous
consequences
the
two
statesmen
exchanged
quick
glance
and
the
premier
shaggy
eyebrows
gathered
in
frown
mr
holmes
the
envelope
is
long
thin
one
of
pale
blue
colour
there
is
seal
of
red
wax
stamped
with
crouching
lion
it
is
addressed
in
large
bold
handwriting
to
fear
sir
said
holmes
that
interesting
and
indeed
essential
as
these
details
are
my
inquiries
must
go
more
to
the
root
of
things
what
was
the
letter
that
is
state
secret
of
the
utmost
importance
and
fear
that
cannot
tell
you
nor
do
see
that
it
is
necessary
if
by
the
aid
of
the
powers
which
you
are
said
to
possess
you
can
find
such
an
envelope
as
describe
with
its
enclosure
you
will
have
deserved
well
of
your
country
and
earned
any
reward
which
it
lies
in
our
power
to
bestow
sherlock
holmes
rose
with
smile
you
are
two
of
the
most
busy
men
in
the
country
said
he
and
in
my
own
small
way
have
also
good
many
calls
upon
me
regret
exceedingly
that
cannot
help
you
in
this
matter
and
any
continuation
of
this
interview
would
be
waste
of
time

the
premier
sprang
to
his
feet
with
that
quick
fierce
gleam
of
his
deep
set
eyes
before
which
cabinet
has
cowered
am
not
accustomed
sir
he
began
but
mastered
his
anger
and
resumed
his
seat
for
minute
or
more
we
all
sat
in
silence
then
the
old
statesman
shrugged
his
shoulders
we
must
accept
your
terms
mr
holmes
no
doubt
you
are
right
and
it
is
unreasonable
for
us
to
expect
you
to
act
unless
we
give
you
our
entire
confidence
agree
with
you
sir
said
the
younger
statesman
then
will
tell
you
relying
entirely
upon
your
honour
and
that
of
your
colleague
dr
watson
may
appeal
to
your
patriotism
also
for
could
not
imagine
greater
misfortune
for
the
country
than
that
this
affair
should
come
out
you
may
safely
trust
us
the
letter
then
is
from
certain
foreign
potentate
who
has
been
ruffled
by
some
recent
colonial
developments
of
this
country
it
has
been
written
hurriedly
and
upon
his
own
responsibility
entirely
inquiries
have
shown
that
his
ministers
know
nothing
of
the
matter
at
the
same
time
it
is
couched
in
so
unfortunate
manner
and
certain
phrases
in
it
are
of
so
provocative
character
that
its
publication
would
undoubtedly
lead
to
most
dangerous
state
of
feeling
in
this
country
there
would
be
such
ferment
sir
that
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
within
week
of
the
publication
of
that
letter
this
country
would
be
involved
in
great
war
holmes
wrote
name
upon
slip
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
the
premier
exactly
it
was
he
and
it
is
this
letter
this
letter
which
may
well
mean
the
expenditure
of
thousand
millions
and
the
lives
of
hundred
thousand
men
which
has
become
lost
in
this
unaccountable
fashion
have
you
informed
the
sender
yes
sir
cipher
telegram
has
been
despatched
perhaps
he
desires
the
publication
of
the
letter
no
sir
we
have
strong
reason
to
believe
that
he
already
understands
that
he
has
acted
in
an
indiscreet
and
hot
headed
manner
it
would
be
greater
blow
to
him
and
to
his
country
than
to
us
if
this
letter
were
to
come
out
if
this
is
so
whose
interest
is
it
that
the
letter
should
come
out
why
should
anyone
desire
to
steal
it
or
to
publish
it
there
mr
holmes
you
take
me
into
regions
of
high
international
politics
but
if
you
consider
the
european
situation
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
perceiving
the
motive
the
whole
of
europe
is
an
armed
camp
there
is
double
league
which
makes
fair
balance
of
military
power
great
britain
holds
the
scales
if
britain
were
driven
into
war
with
one
confederacy
it
would
assure
the
supremacy
of
the
other
confederacy
whether
they
joined
in
the
war
or
not
do
you
follow
very
clearly
it
is
then
the
interest
of
the
enemies
of
this
potentate
to
secure
and
publish
this
letter
so
as
to
make
breach
between
his
country
and
ours
yes
sir
and
to
whom
would
this
document
be
sent
if
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
an
enemy
to
any
of
the
great
chancelleries
of
europe
it
is
probably
speeding
on
its
way
thither
at
the
present
instant
as
fast
as
steam
can
take
it
mr
trelawney
hope
dropped
his
head
on
his
chest
and
groaned
aloud
the
premier
placed
his
hand
kindly
upon
his
shoulder
it
is
your
misfortune
my
dear
fellow
no
one
can
blame
you
there
is
no
precaution
which
you
have
neglected
now
mr
holmes
you
are
in
full
possession
of
the
facts
what
course
do
you
recommend
holmes
shook
his
head
mournfully
you
think
sir
that
unless
this
document
is
recovered
there
will
be
war
think
it
is
very
probable
then
sir
prepare
for
war
that
is
hard
saying
mr
holmes
consider
the
facts
sir
it
is
inconceivable
that
it
was
taken
after
eleven
thirty
at
night
since
understand
that
mr
hope
and
his
wife
were
both
in
the
room
from
that
hour
until
the
loss
was
found
out
it
was
taken
then
yesterday
evening
between
seven
thirty
and
eleven
thirty
probably
near
the
earlier
hour
since
whoever
took
it
evidently
knew
that
it
was
there
and
would
naturally
secure
it
as
early
as
possible
now
sir
if
document
of
this
importance
were
taken
at
that
hour
where
can
it
be
now
no
one
has
any
reason
to
retain
it
has
been
passed
rapidly
on
to
those
who
need
it
what
chance
have
we
now
to
overtake
or
even
to
trace
it
is
beyond
our
reach
the
prime
minister
rose
from
the
settee
what
you
say
is
perfectly
logical
mr
holmes
feel
that
the
matter
is
indeed
out
of
our
hands
let
us
presume
for
argument
sake
that
the
document
was
taken
by
the
maid
or
by
the
valet
they
are
both
old
and
tried
servants
understand
you
to
say
that
your
room
is
on
the
second
floor
that
there
is
no
entrance
from
without
and
that
from
within
no
one
could
go
up
unobserved
it
must
then
be
somebody
in
the
house
who
has
taken
it
to
whom
would
the
thief
take
it
to
one
of
several
international
spies
and
secret
agents
whose
names
are
tolerably
familiar
to
me
there
are
three
who
may
be
said
to
be
the
heads
of
their
profession
will
begin
my
research
by
going
round
and
finding
if
each
of
them
is
at
his
post
if
one
is
missing
especially
if
he
has
disappeared
since
last
night
we
will
have
some
indication
as
to
where
the
document
has
gone
why
should
he
be
missing
asked
the
european
secretary
he
would
take
the
letter
to
an
embassy
in
london
as
likely
as
not
fancy
not
these
agents
work
independently
and
their
relations
with
the
embassies
are
often
strained
the
prime
minister
nodded
his
acquiescence
believe
you
are
right
mr
holmes
he
would
take
so
valuable
prize
to
head
quarters
with
his
own
hands
think
that
your
course
of
action
is
an
excellent
one
meanwhile
hope
we
cannot
neglect
all
our
other
duties
on
account
of
this
one
misfortune
should
there
be
any
fresh
developments
during
the
day
we
shall
communicate
with
you
and
you
will
no
doubt
let
us
know
the
results
of
your
own
inquiries
the
two
statesmen
bowed
and
walked
gravely
from
the
room
when
our
illustrious
visitors
had
departed
holmes
lit
his
pipe
in
silence
and
sat
for
some
time
lost
in
the
deepest
thought
had
opened
the
morning
paper
and
was
immersed
in
sensational
crime
which
had
occurred
in
london
the
night
before
when
my
friend
gave
an
exclamation
sprang
to
his
feet
and
laid
his
pipe
down
upon
the
mantelpiece
yes
said
he
there
is
no
better
way
of
approaching
it
the
situation
is
desperate
but
not
hopeless
even
now
if
we
could
be
sure
which
of
them
has
taken
it
is
just
possible
that
it
has
not
yet
passed
out
of
his
hands
after
all
it
is
question
of
money
with
these
fellows
and
have
the
british
treasury
behind
me
if
it
on
the
market
ll
buy
it
if
it
means
another
penny
on
the
income
tax
it
is
conceivable
that
the
fellow
might
hold
it
back
to
see
what
bids
come
from
this
side
before
he
tries
his
luck
on
the
other
there
are
only
those
three
capable
of
playing
so
bold
game
there
are
oberstein
la
rothiere
and
eduardo
lucas
will
see
each
of
them
glanced
at
my
morning
paper
is
that
eduardo
lucas
of
godolphin
street
yes
you
will
not
see
him
why
not
he
was
murdered
in
his
house
last
night
my
friend
has
so
often
astonished
me
in
the
course
of
our
adventures
that
it
was
with
sense
of
exultation
that
realized
how
completely
had
astonished
him
he
stared
in
amazement
and
then
snatched
the
paper
from
my
hands
this
was
the
paragraph
which
had
been
engaged
in
reading
when
he
rose
from
his
chair
murder
in
westminster
crime
of
mysterious
character
was
committed
last
night
at
16
godolphin
street
one
of
the
old
fashioned
and
secluded
rows
of
eighteenth
century
houses
which
lie
between
the
river
and
the
abbey
almost
in
the
shadow
of
the
great
tower
of
the
houses
of
parliament
this
small
but
select
mansion
has
been
inhabited
for
some
years
by
mr
eduardo
lucas
well
known
in
society
circles
both
on
account
of
his
charming
personality
and
because
he
has
the
well
deserved
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
best
amateur
tenors
in
the
country
mr
lucas
is
an
unmarried
man
thirty
four
years
of
age
and
his
establishment
consists
of
mrs
pringle
an
elderly
housekeeper
and
of
mitton
his
valet
the
former
retires
early
and
sleeps
at
the
top
of
the
house
the
valet
was
out
for
the
evening
visiting
friend
at
hammersmith
from
ten
clock
onwards
mr
lucas
had
the
house
to
himself
what
occurred
during
that
time
has
not
yet
transpired
but
at
quarter
to
twelve
police
constable
barrett
passing
along
godolphin
street
observed
that
the
door
of
no
16
was
ajar
he
knocked
but
received
no
answer
perceiving
light
in
the
front
room
he
advanced
into
the
passage
and
again
knocked
but
without
reply
he
then
pushed
open
the
door
and
entered
the
room
was
in
state
of
wild
disorder
the
furniture
being
all
swept
to
one
side
and
one
chair
lying
on
its
back
in
the
centre
beside
this
chair
and
still
grasping
one
of
its
legs
lay
the
unfortunate
tenant
of
the
house
he
had
been
stabbed
to
the
heart
and
must
have
died
instantly
the
knife
with
which
the
crime
had
been
committed
was
curved
indian
dagger
plucked
down
from
trophy
of
oriental
arms
which
adorned
one
of
the
walls
robbery
does
not
appear
to
have
been
the
motive
of
the
crime
for
there
had
been
no
attempt
to
remove
the
valuable
contents
of
the
room
mr
eduardo
lucas
was
so
well
known
and
popular
that
his
violent
and
mysterious
fate
will
arouse
painful
interest
and
intense
sympathy
in
wide
spread
circle
of
friends

well
watson
what
do
you
make
of
this
asked
holmes
after
long
pause
it
is
an
amazing
coincidence
here
is
one
of
the
three
men
whom
we
had
named
as
possible
actors
in
this
drama
and
he
meets
violent
death
during
the
very
hours
when
we
know
that
drama
was
being
enacted
the
odds
are
enormous
against
its
being
coincidence
no
figures
could
express
them
no
my
dear
watson
the
two
events
are
connected
must
be
connected
it
is
for
us
to
find
the
connection
but
now
the
official
police
must
know
all
not
at
all
they
know
all
they
see
at
godolphin
street
they
know
and
shall
know
nothing
of
whitehall
terrace
only
we
know
of
both
events
and
can
trace
the
relation
between
them
there
is
one
obvious
point
which
would
in
any
case
have
turned
my
suspicions
against
lucas
godolphin
street
westminster
is
only
few
minutes
walk
from
whitehall
terrace
the
other
secret
agents
whom
have
named
live
in
the
extreme
west
end
it
was
easier
therefore
for
lucas
than
for
the
others
to
establish
connection
or
receive
message
from
the
european
secretary
household
small
thing
and
yet
where
events
are
compressed
into
few
hours
it
may
prove
essential
halloa
what
have
we
here
mrs
hudson
had
appeared
with
lady
card
upon
her
salver
holmes
glanced
at
it
raised
his
eyebrows
and
handed
it
over
to
me
ask
lady
hilda
trelawney
hope
if
she
will
be
kind
enough
to
step
up
said
he
moment
later
our
modest
apartment
already
so
distinguished
that
morning
was
further
honoured
by
the
entrance
of
the
most
lovely
woman
in
london
had
often
heard
of
the
beauty
of
the
youngest
daughter
of
the
duke
of
belminster
but
no
description
of
it
and
no
contemplation
of
colourless
photographs
had
prepared
me
for
the
subtle
delicate
charm
and
the
beautiful
colouring
of
that
exquisite
head
and
yet
as
we
saw
it
that
autumn
morning
it
was
not
its
beauty
which
would
be
the
first
thing
to
impress
the
observer
the
cheek
was
lovely
but
it
was
paled
with
emotion
the
eyes
were
bright
but
it
was
the
brightness
of
fever
the
sensitive
mouth
was
tight
and
drawn
in
an
effort
after
self
command
terror
not
beauty
was
what
sprang
first
to
the
eye
as
our
fair
visitor
stood
framed
for
an
instant
in
the
open
door
has
my
husband
been
here
mr
holmes
yes
madam
he
has
been
here
mr
holmes
implore
you
not
to
tell
him
that
came
here
holmes
bowed
coldly
and
motioned
the
lady
to
chair
your
ladyship
places
me
in
very
delicate
position
beg
that
you
will
sit
down
and
tell
me
what
you
desire
but
fear
that
cannot
make
any
unconditional
promise
she
swept
across
the
room
and
seated
herself
with
her
back
to
the
window
it
was
queenly
presence
tall
graceful
and
intensely
womanly
mr
holmes
she
said
and
her
white
gloved
hands
clasped
and
unclasped
as
she
spoke
will
speak
frankly
to
you
in
the
hope
that
it
may
induce
you
to
speak
frankly
in
return
there
is
complete
confidence
between
my
husband
and
me
on
all
matters
save
one
that
one
is
politics
on
this
his
lips
are
sealed
he
tells
me
nothing
now
am
aware
that
there
was
most
deplorable
occurrence
in
our
house
last
night
know
that
paper
has
disappeared
but
because
the
matter
is
political
my
husband
refuses
to
take
me
into
his
complete
confidence
now
it
is
essential
say
that
should
thoroughly
understand
it
you
are
the
only
other
person
save
only
these
politicians
who
knows
the
true
facts
beg
you
then
mr
holmes
to
tell
me
exactly
what
has
happened
and
what
it
will
lead
to
tell
me
all
mr
holmes
let
no
regard
for
your
client
interests
keep
you
silent
for
assure
you
that
his
interests
if
he
would
only
see
it
would
be
best
served
by
taking
me
into
his
complete
confidence
what
was
this
paper
which
was
stolen
madam
what
you
ask
me
is
really
impossible
she
groaned
and
sank
her
face
in
her
hands
you
must
see
that
this
is
so
madam
if
your
husband
thinks
fit
to
keep
you
in
the
dark
over
this
matter
is
it
for
me
who
has
only
learned
the
true
facts
under
the
pledge
of
professional
secrecy
to
tell
what
he
has
withheld
it
is
not
fair
to
ask
it
is
him
whom
you
must
ask
have
asked
him
come
to
you
as
last
resource
but
without
your
telling
me
anything
definite
mr
holmes
you
may
do
great
service
if
you
would
enlighten
me
on
one
point
what
is
it
madam
is
my
husband
political
career
likely
to
suffer
through
this
incident
well
madam
unless
it
is
set
right
it
may
certainly
have
very
unfortunate
effect
ah
she
drew
in
her
breath
sharply
as
one
whose
doubts
are
resolved
one
more
question
mr
holmes
from
an
expression
which
my
husband
dropped
in
the
first
shock
of
this
disaster
understood
that
terrible
public
consequences
might
arise
from
the
loss
of
this
document
if
he
said
so
certainly
cannot
deny
it
of
what
nature
are
they
nay
madam
there
again
you
ask
me
more
than
can
possibly
answer
then
will
take
up
no
more
of
your
time
cannot
blame
you
mr
holmes
for
having
refused
to
speak
more
freely
and
you
on
your
side
will
not
am
sure
think
the
worse
of
me
because
desire
even
against
his
will
to
share
my
husband
anxieties
once
more
beg
that
you
will
say
nothing
of
my
visit
she
looked
back
at
us
from
the
door
and
had
last
impression
of
that
beautiful
haunted
face
the
startled
eyes
and
the
drawn
mouth
then
she
was
gone
now
watson
the
fair
sex
is
your
department
said
holmes
with
smile
when
the
dwindling
frou
of
skirts
had
ended
in
the
slam
of
the
front
door
what
was
the
fair
lady
game
what
did
she
really
want
surely
her
own
statement
is
clear
and
her
anxiety
very
natural
hum
think
of
her
appearance
watson
her
manner
her
suppressed
excitement
her
restlessness
her
tenacity
in
asking
questions
remember
that
she
comes
of
caste
who
do
not
lightly
show
emotion
she
was
certainly
much
moved
remember
also
the
curious
earnestness
with
which
she
assured
us
that
it
was
best
for
her
husband
that
she
should
know
all
what
did
she
mean
by
that
and
you
must
have
observed
watson
how
she
manoeuvred
to
have
the
light
at
her
back
she
did
not
wish
us
to
read
her
expression
yes
she
chose
the
one
chair
in
the
room
and
yet
the
motives
of
women
are
so
inscrutable
you
remember
the
woman
at
margate
whom
suspected
for
the
same
reason
no
powder
on
her
nose
that
proved
to
be
the
correct
solution
how
can
you
build
on
such
quicksand
their
most
trivial
action
may
mean
volumes
or
their
most
extraordinary
conduct
may
depend
upon
hairpin
or
curling
tongs
good
morning
watson
you
are
off
yes
will
wile
away
the
morning
at
godolphin
street
with
our
friends
of
the
regular
establishment
with
eduardo
lucas
lies
the
solution
of
our
problem
though
must
admit
that
have
not
an
inkling
as
to
what
form
it
may
take
it
is
capital
mistake
to
theorize
in
advance
of
the
facts
do
you
stay
on
guard
my
good
watson
and
receive
any
fresh
visitors
ll
join
you
at
lunch
if
am
able
all
that
day
and
the
next
and
the
next
holmes
was
in
mood
which
his
friends
would
call
taciturn
and
others
morose
he
ran
out
and
ran
in
smoked
incessantly
played
snatches
on
his
violin
sank
into
reveries
devoured
sandwiches
at
irregular
hours
and
hardly
answered
the
casual
questions
which
put
to
him
it
was
evident
to
me
that
things
were
not
going
well
with
him
or
his
quest
he
would
say
nothing
of
the
case
and
it
was
from
the
papers
that
learned
the
particulars
of
the
inquest
and
the
arrest
with
the
subsequent
release
of
john
mitton
the
valet
of
the
deceased
the
coroner
jury
brought
in
the
obvious
wilful
murder
but
the
parties
remained
as
unknown
as
ever
no
motive
was
suggested
the
room
was
full
of
articles
of
value
but
none
had
been
taken
the
dead
man
papers
had
not
been
tampered
with
they
were
carefully
examined
and
showed
that
he
was
keen
student
of
international
politics
an
indefatigable
gossip
remarkable
linguist
and
an
untiring
letter
writer
he
had
been
on
intimate
terms
with
the
leading
politicians
of
several
countries
but
nothing
sensational
was
discovered
among
the
documents
which
filled
his
drawers
as
to
his
relations
with
women
they
appeared
to
have
been
promiscuous
but
superficial
he
had
many
acquaintances
among
them
but
few
friends
and
no
one
whom
he
loved
his
habits
were
regular
his
conduct
inoffensive
his
death
was
an
absolute
mystery
and
likely
to
remain
so
as
to
the
arrest
of
john
mitton
the
valet
it
was
counsel
of
despair
as
an
alternative
to
absolute
inaction
but
no
case
could
be
sustained
against
him
he
had
visited
friends
in
hammersmith
that
night
the
alibi
was
complete
it
is
true
that
he
started
home
at
an
hour
which
should
have
brought
him
to
westminster
before
the
time
when
the
crime
was
discovered
but
his
own
explanation
that
he
had
walked
part
of
the
way
seemed
probable
enough
in
view
of
the
fineness
of
the
night
he
had
actually
arrived
at
twelve
clock
and
appeared
to
be
overwhelmed
by
the
unexpected
tragedy
he
had
always
been
on
good
terms
with
his
master
several
of
the
dead
man
possessions
notably
small
case
of
razors
had
been
found
in
the
valet
boxes
but
he
explained
that
they
had
been
presents
from
the
deceased
and
the
housekeeper
was
able
to
corroborate
the
story
mitton
had
been
in
lucas
employment
for
three
years
it
was
noticeable
that
lucas
did
not
take
mitton
on
the
continent
with
him
sometimes
he
visited
paris
for
three
months
on
end
but
mitton
was
left
in
charge
of
the
godolphin
street
house
as
to
the
housekeeper
she
had
heard
nothing
on
the
night
of
the
crime
if
her
master
had
visitor
he
had
himself
admitted
him

so
for
three
mornings
the
mystery
remained
so
far
as
could
follow
it
in
the
papers
if
holmes
knew
more
he
kept
his
own
counsel
but
as
he
told
me
that
inspector
lestrade
had
taken
him
into
his
confidence
in
the
case
knew
that
he
was
in
close
touch
with
every
development
upon
the
fourth
day
there
appeared
long
telegram
from
paris
which
seemed
to
solve
the
whole
question
discovery
has
just
been
made
by
the
parisian
police
said
the
daily
telegraph
which
raises
the
veil
which
hung
round
the
tragic
fate
of
mr
eduardo
lucas
who
met
his
death
by
violence
last
monday
night
at
godolphin
street
westminster
our
readers
will
remember
that
the
deceased
gentleman
was
found
stabbed
in
his
room
and
that
some
suspicion
attached
to
his
valet
but
that
the
case
broke
down
on
an
alibi
yesterday
lady
who
has
been
known
as
mme
henri
fournaye
occupying
small
villa
in
the
rue
austerlitz
was
reported
to
the
authorities
by
her
servants
as
being
insane
an
examination
showed
that
she
had
indeed
developed
mania
of
dangerous
and
permanent
form
on
inquiry
the
police
have
discovered
that
mme
henri
fournaye
only
returned
from
journey
to
london
on
tuesday
last
and
there
is
evidence
to
connect
her
with
the
crime
at
westminster
comparison
of
photographs
has
proved
conclusively
that
henri
fournaye
and
eduardo
lucas
were
really
one
and
the
same
person
and
that
the
deceased
had
for
some
reason
lived
double
life
in
london
and
paris
mme
fournaye
who
is
of
creole
origin
is
of
an
extremely
excitable
nature
and
has
suffered
in
the
past
from
attacks
of
jealousy
which
have
amounted
to
frenzy
it
is
conjectured
that
it
was
in
one
of
these
that
she
committed
the
terrible
crime
which
has
caused
such
sensation
in
london
her
movements
upon
the
monday
night
have
not
yet
been
traced
but
it
is
undoubted
that
woman
answering
to
her
description
attracted
much
attention
at
charing
cross
station
on
tuesday
morning
by
the
wildness
of
her
appearance
and
the
violence
of
her
gestures
it
is
probable
therefore
that
the
crime
was
either
committed
when
insane
or
that
its
immediate
effect
was
to
drive
the
unhappy
woman
out
of
her
mind
at
present
she
is
unable
to
give
any
coherent
account
of
the
past
and
the
doctors
hold
out
no
hopes
of
the
re
establishment
of
her
reason
there
is
evidence
that
woman
who
might
have
been
mme
fournaye
was
seen
for
some
hours
on
monday
night
watching
the
house
in
godolphin
street
what
do
you
think
of
that
holmes
had
read
the
account
aloud
to
him
while
he
finished
his
breakfast
my
dear
watson
said
he
as
he
rose
from
the
table
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
you
are
most
long
suffering
but
if
have
told
you
nothing
in
the
last
three
days
it
is
because
there
is
nothing
to
tell
even
now
this
report
from
paris
does
not
help
us
much
surely
it
is
final
as
regards
the
man
death
the
man
death
is
mere
incident
trivial
episode
in
comparison
with
our
real
task
which
is
to
trace
this
document
and
save
european
catastrophe
only
one
important
thing
has
happened
in
the
last
three
days
and
that
is
that
nothing
has
happened
get
reports
almost
hourly
from
the
government
and
it
is
certain
that
nowhere
in
europe
is
there
any
sign
of
trouble
now
if
this
letter
were
loose
no
it
can
be
loose
but
if
it
isn
loose
where
can
it
be
who
has
it
why
is
it
held
back
that
the
question
that
beats
in
my
brain
like
hammer
was
it
indeed
coincidence
that
lucas
should
meet
his
death
on
the
night
when
the
letter
disappeared
did
the
letter
ever
reach
him
if
so
why
is
it
not
among
his
papers
did
this
mad
wife
of
his
carry
it
off
with
her
if
so
is
it
in
her
house
in
paris
how
could
search
for
it
without
the
french
police
having
their
suspicions
aroused
it
is
case
my
dear
watson
where
the
law
is
as
dangerous
to
us
as
the
criminals
are
every
man
hand
is
against
us
and
yet
the
interests
at
stake
are
colossal
should
bring
it
to
successful
conclusion
it
will
certainly
represent
the
crowning
glory
of
my
career
ah
here
is
my
latest
from
the
front
he
glanced
hurriedly
at
the
note
which
had
been
handed
in
halloa
lestrade
seems
to
have
observed
something
of
interest
put
on
your
hat
watson
and
we
will
stroll
down
together
to
westminster
it
was
my
first
visit
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
high
dingy
narrow
chested
house
prim
formal
and
solid
like
the
century
which
gave
it
birth
lestrade
bulldog
features
gazed
out
at
us
from
the
front
window
and
he
greeted
us
warmly
when
big
constable
had
opened
the
door
and
let
us
in
the
room
into
which
we
were
shown
was
that
in
which
the
crime
had
been
committed
but
no
trace
of
it
now
remained
save
an
ugly
irregular
stain
upon
the
carpet
this
carpet
was
small
square
drugget
in
the
centre
of
the
room
surrounded
by
broad
expanse
of
beautiful
old
fashioned
wood
flooring
in
square
blocks
highly
polished
over
the
fireplace
was
magnificent
trophy
of
weapons
one
of
which
had
been
used
on
that
tragic
night
in
the
window
was
sumptuous
writing
desk
and
every
detail
of
the
apartment
the
pictures
the
rugs
and
the
hangings
all
pointed
to
taste
which
was
luxurious
to
the
verge
of
effeminacy
seen
the
paris
news
asked
lestrade
holmes
nodded
our
french
friends
seem
to
have
touched
the
spot
this
time
no
doubt
it
just
as
they
say
she
knocked
at
the
door
surprise
visit
guess
for
he
kept
his
life
in
water
tight
compartments
he
let
her
in
couldn
keep
her
in
the
street
she
told
him
how
she
had
traced
him
reproached
him
one
thing
led
to
another
and
then
with
that
dagger
so
handy
the
end
soon
came
it
wasn
all
done
in
an
instant
though
for
these
chairs
were
all
swept
over
yonder
and
he
had
one
in
his
hand
as
if
he
had
tried
to
hold
her
off
with
it
we
ve
got
it
all
clear
as
if
we
had
seen
it
holmes
raised
his
eyebrows
and
yet
you
have
sent
for
me
ah
yes
that
another
matter
mere
trifle
but
the
sort
of
thing
you
take
an
interest
in
queer
you
know
and
what
you
might
call
freakish
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
main
fact
can
have
on
the
face
of
it
what
is
it
then
well
you
know
after
crime
of
this
sort
we
are
very
careful
to
keep
things
in
their
position
nothing
has
been
moved
officer
in
charge
here
day
and
night
this
morning
as
the
man
was
buried
and
the
investigation
over
so
far
as
this
room
is
concerned
we
thought
we
could
tidy
up
bit
this
carpet
you
see
it
is
not
fastened
down
only
just
laid
there
we
had
occasion
to
raise
it
we
found
yes
you
found
holmes
face
grew
tense
with
anxiety
well
sure
you
would
never
guess
in
hundred
years
what
we
did
find
you
see
that
stain
on
the
carpet
well
great
deal
must
have
soaked
through
must
it
not
undoubtedly
it
must
well
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
that
there
is
no
stain
on
the
white
woodwork
to
correspond
no
stain
but
there
must
yes
so
you
would
say
but
the
fact
remains
that
there
isn
he
took
the
corner
of
the
carpet
in
his
hand
and
turning
it
over
he
showed
that
it
was
indeed
as
he
said
but
the
underside
is
as
stained
as
the
upper
it
must
have
left
mark
lestrade
chuckled
with
delight
at
having
puzzled
the
famous
expert
now
ll
show
you
the
explanation
there
is
second
stain
but
it
does
not
correspond
with
the
other
see
for
yourself
as
he
spoke
he
turned
over
another
portion
of
the
carpet
and
there
sure
enough
was
great
crimson
spill
upon
the
square
white
facing
of
the
old
fashioned
floor
what
do
you
make
of
that
mr
holmes
why
it
is
simple
enough
the
two
stains
did
correspond
but
the
carpet
has
been
turned
round
as
it
was
square
and
unfastened
it
was
easily
done
the
official
police
don
need
you
mr
holmes
to
tell
them
that
the
carpet
must
have
been
turned
round
that
clear
enough
for
the
stains
lie
above
each
other
if
you
lay
it
over
this
way
but
what
want
to
know
is
who
shifted
the
carpet
and
why
could
see
from
holmes
rigid
face
that
he
was
vibrating
with
inward
excitement
look
here
lestrade
said
he
has
that
constable
in
the
passage
been
in
charge
of
the
place
all
the
time
yes
he
has
well
take
my
advice
examine
him
carefully
don
do
it
before
us
we
ll
wait
here
you
take
him
into
the
back
room
you
ll
be
more
likely
to
get
confession
out
of
him
alone
ask
him
how
he
dared
to
admit
people
and
leave
them
alone
in
this
room
don
ask
him
if
he
has
done
it
take
it
for
granted
tell
him
you
know
someone
has
been
here
press
him
tell
him
that
full
confession
is
his
only
chance
of
forgiveness
do
exactly
what
tell
you
by
george
if
he
knows
ll
have
it
out
of
him
cried
lestrade
he
darted
into
the
hall
and
few
moments
later
his
bullying
voice
sounded
from
the
back
room
now
watson
now
cried
holmes
with
frenzied
eagerness
all
the
demoniacal
force
of
the
man
masked
behind
that
listless
manner
burst
out
in
paroxysm
of
energy
he
tore
the
drugget
from
the
floor
and
in
an
instant
was
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
clawing
at
each
of
the
squares
of
wood
beneath
it
one
turned
sideways
as
he
dug
his
nails
into
the
edge
of
it
hinged
back
like
the
lid
of
box
small
black
cavity
opened
beneath
it
holmes
plunged
his
eager
hand
into
it
and
drew
it
out
with
bitter
snarl
of
anger
and
disappointment
it
was
empty

quick
watson
quick
get
it
back
again
the
wooden
lid
was
replaced
and
the
drugget
had
only
just
been
drawn
straight
when
lestrade
voice
was
heard
in
the
passage
he
found
holmes
leaning
languidly
against
the
mantelpiece
resigned
and
patient
endeavouring
to
conceal
his
irrepressible
yawns
sorry
to
keep
you
waiting
mr
holmes
can
see
that
you
are
bored
to
death
with
the
whole
affair
well
he
has
confessed
all
right
come
in
here
macPherson
let
these
gentlemen
hear
of
your
most
inexcusable
conduct
the
big
constable
very
hot
and
penitent
sidled
into
the
room
meant
no
harm
sir
sure
the
young
woman
came
to
the
door
last
evening
mistook
the
house
she
did
and
then
we
got
talking
it
lonesome
when
you
re
on
duty
here
all
day
well
what
happened
then
she
wanted
to
see
where
the
crime
was
done
had
read
about
it
in
the
papers
she
said
she
was
very
respectable
well
spoken
young
woman
sir
and
saw
no
harm
in
letting
her
have
peep
when
she
saw
that
mark
on
the
carpet
down
she
dropped
on
the
floor
and
lay
as
if
she
were
dead
ran
to
the
back
and
got
some
water
but
could
not
bring
her
to
then
went
round
the
corner
to
the
ivy
plant
for
some
brandy
and
by
the
time
had
brought
it
back
the
young
woman
had
recovered
and
was
off
ashamed
of
herself
dare
say
and
dared
not
face
me
how
about
moving
that
drugget
well
sir
it
was
bit
rumpled
certainly
when
came
back
you
see
she
fell
on
it
and
it
lies
on
polished
floor
with
nothing
to
keep
it
in
place
straightened
it
out
afterwards
it
lesson
to
you
that
you
can
deceive
me
constable
macPherson
said
lestrade
with
dignity
no
doubt
you
thought
that
your
breach
of
duty
could
never
be
discovered
and
yet
mere
glance
at
that
drugget
was
enough
to
convince
me
that
someone
had
been
admitted
to
the
room
it
lucky
for
you
my
man
that
nothing
is
missing
or
you
would
find
yourself
in
queer
street
sorry
to
have
called
you
down
over
such
petty
business
mr
holmes
but
thought
the
point
of
the
second
stain
not
corresponding
with
the
first
would
interest
you
certainly
it
was
most
interesting
has
this
woman
only
been
here
once
constable
yes
sir
only
once
who
was
she
don
know
the
name
sir
was
answering
an
advertisement
about
type
writing
and
came
to
the
wrong
number
very
pleasant
genteel
young
woman
sir
tall
handsome
yes
sir
she
was
well
grown
young
woman
suppose
you
might
say
she
was
handsome
perhaps
some
would
say
she
was
very
handsome
oh
officer
do
let
me
have
peep
says
she
had
pretty
coaxing
ways
as
you
might
say
and
thought
there
was
no
harm
in
letting
her
just
put
her
head
through
the
door
how
was
she
dressed
quiet
sir
long
mantle
down
to
her
feet
what
time
was
it
was
just
growing
dusk
at
the
time
they
were
lighting
the
lamps
as
came
back
with
the
brandy
very
good
said
holmes
come
watson
think
that
we
have
more
important
work
elsewhere
as
we
left
the
house
lestrade
remained
in
the
front
room
while
the
repentant
constable
opened
the
door
to
let
us
out
holmes
turned
on
the
step
and
held
up
something
in
his
hand
the
constable
stared
intently
good
lord
sir
he
cried
with
amazement
on
his
face
holmes
put
his
finger
on
his
lips
replaced
his
hand
in
his
breast
pocket
and
burst
out
laughing
as
we
turned
down
the
street
excellent
said
he
come
friend
watson
the
curtain
rings
up
for
the
last
act
you
will
be
relieved
to
hear
that
there
will
be
no
war
that
the
right
honourable
trelawney
hope
will
suffer
no
set
back
in
his
brilliant
career
that
the
indiscreet
sovereign
will
receive
no
punishment
for
his
indiscretion
that
the
prime
minister
will
have
no
european
complication
to
deal
with
and
that
with
little
tact
and
management
upon
our
part
nobody
will
be
penny
the
worse
for
what
might
have
been
very
ugly
incident
my
mind
filled
with
admiration
for
this
extraordinary
man
you
have
solved
it
cried
hardly
that
watson
there
are
some
points
which
are
as
dark
as
ever
but
we
have
so
much
that
it
will
be
our
own
fault
if
we
cannot
get
the
rest
we
will
go
straight
to
whitehall
terrace
and
bring
the
matter
to
head
when
we
arrived
at
the
residence
of
the
european
secretary
it
was
for
lady
hilda
trelawney
hope
that
sherlock
holmes
inquired
we
were
shown
into
the
morning
room
mr
holmes
said
the
lady
and
her
face
was
pink
with
her
indignation
this
is
surely
most
unfair
and
ungenerous
upon
your
part
desired
as
have
explained
to
keep
my
visit
to
you
secret
lest
my
husband
should
think
that
was
intruding
into
his
affairs
and
yet
you
compromise
me
by
coming
here
and
so
showing
that
there
are
business
relations
between
us
unfortunately
madam
had
no
possible
alternative
have
been
commissioned
to
recover
this
immensely
important
paper
must
therefore
ask
you
madam
to
be
kind
enough
to
place
it
in
my
hands
the
lady
sprang
to
her
feet
with
the
colour
all
dashed
in
an
instant
from
her
beautiful
face
her
eyes
glazed
she
tottered
thought
that
she
would
faint
then
with
grand
effort
she
rallied
from
the
shock
and
supreme
astonishment
and
indignation
chased
every
other
expression
from
her
features
you
insult
me
mr
holmes
come
madam
it
is
useless
give
up
the
letter
she
darted
to
the
bell
the
butler
shall
show
you
out
do
not
ring
lady
hilda
if
you
do
then
all
my
earnest
efforts
to
avoid
scandal
will
be
frustrated
give
up
the
letter
and
all
will
be
set
right
if
you
will
work
with
me
can
arrange
everything
if
you
work
against
me
must
expose
you
she
stood
grandly
defiant
queenly
figure
her
eyes
fixed
upon
his
as
if
she
would
read
his
very
soul
her
hand
was
on
the
bell
but
she
had
forborne
to
ring
it
you
are
trying
to
frighten
me
it
is
not
very
manly
thing
mr
holmes
to
come
here
and
browbeat
woman
you
say
that
you
know
something
what
is
it
that
you
know
pray
sit
down
madam
you
will
hurt
yourself
there
if
you
fall

of
your
visit
to
eduardo
lucas
of
your
giving
him
this
document
of
your
ingenious
return
to
the
room
last
night
and
of
the
manner
in
which
you
took
the
letter
from
the
hiding
place
under
the
carpet
she
stared
at
him
with
an
ashen
face
and
gulped
twice
before
she
could
speak
you
are
mad
mr
holmes

are
mad
she
cried
at
last
he
drew
small
piece
of
cardboard
from
his
pocket

was
the
face
of
woman

out
of
portrait

carried
this
because

it
might
be
useful

he

policeman

she
gave
gasp
and
her
head
dropped
back
in
the
chair

her
courage
was
admirable
even
now
she
would
not
own
defeat
tell
you
again
mr
holmes
that
you
are
under
some
absurd
illusion
holmes
rose
from
his
chair

sorry
for
you
lady
hilda

done
my
best
for

see
that

will
be

at

to

at
his
watch
still
quarter
of
an
hour
said
he
very
good
shall
wait
the
butler
had
hardly
closed
the
door
behind
him
when
lady
hilda
was
down
on
her
knees
at
holmes
feet
her
hands
out
stretched
her
beautiful
face
upturned
and
wet
with
her
tears
oh

me
mr
holmes
spare
me
she
pleaded
in
frenzy
of
supplication
for
heaven
sake
don
tell
him
love
him
so
would
not
bring
one
shadow
on
his
life
and
this
know
would
break
his
noble
heart
holmes
raised
the
lady
am
thankful
madam
that
you
have
come
to
your
senses

at
this
last
moment

instant

where
is
the
letter
she
darted
across
to
writing
desk
unlocked
it
and
drew
out
long
blue
envelope
here

is
mr
holmes

to
heaven

never
seen

think
of
some
way
where
is
the
despatch
box
still
in
his
bedroom
what
stroke
of
luck
quick
madam

it
here
moment
later

flat
box

her
hand

down
into
the
heart

the
leaves

now
we
are
ready
for
him
said
holmes
we
have
still
ten
minutes
am
going
far
to
screen
you
lady
hilda
in
return
you
will
spend
the
time
in
telling
me
frankly
the
real
meaning
of
this
extraordinary
affair
mr
holmes
will
tell
you
everything
cried
the
lady
oh
mr
holmes
would
cut
off
my
right
hand
before
gave
him
moment
of
sorrow
there
is
no
woman
in
all
london
who
loves
her
husband
as
do
and
yet
if
he
knew
how
have
acted
how
have
been
compelled
to
act
he
would
never
forgive
me
for
his
own
honour
stands
so
high
that
he
could
not
forget
or
pardon
lapse
in
another
help
me
mr
holmes
my
happiness
his
happiness
our
very
lives
are
at
stake
quick
madam
the
time
grows
short
it
was
letter
of
mine
mr
holmes
an
indiscreet
letter
written
before
my
marriage
foolish
letter
of
an
impulsive
loving
girl
meant
no
harm
and
yet
he
would
have
thought
it
criminal
had
he
read
that
letter
his
confidence
would
have
been
for
ever
destroyed
it
is
years
since
wrote
it
had
thought
that
the
whole
matter
was
forgotten
then
at
last
heard
from
this
man
lucas
that
it
had
passed
into
his
hands
and
that
he
would
lay
it
before
my
husband
implored
his
mercy
he
said
that
he
would
return
my
letter
if
would
bring
him
certain
document
which
he
described
in
my
husband
despatch
box
he
had
some
spy
in
the
office
who
had
told
him
of
its
existence
he
assured
me
that
no
harm
could
come
to
my
husband
put
yourself
in
my
position
mr
holmes
what
was
to
do
take
your
husband
into
your
confidence
could
not
mr
holmes
could
not
on
the
one
side
seemed
certain
ruin
on
the
other
terrible
as
it
seemed
to
take
my
husband
paper
still
in
matter
of
politics
could
not
understand
the
consequences
while
in
matter
of
love
and
trust
they
were
only
too
clear
to
me
did
it
mr
holmes
took
an
impression
of
his
key
this
man
lucas
furnished
duplicate
opened
his
despatch
box
took
the
paper
and
conveyed
it
to
godolphin
street
what
happened
there
madam
tapped
at
the
door
as
agreed
lucas
opened
it
followed
him
into
his
room
leaving
the
hall
door
ajar
behind
me
for
feared
to
be
alone
with
the
man
remember
that
there
was
woman
outside
as
entered
our
business
was
soon
done
he
had
my
letter
on
his
desk
handed
him
the
document
he
gave
me
the
letter
at
this
instant
there
was
sound
at
the
door
there
were
steps
in
the
passage
lucas
quickly
turned
back
the
drugget
thrust
the
document
into
some
hiding
place
there
and
covered
it
over
what
happened
after
that
is
like
some
fearful
dream
have
vision
of
dark
frantic
face
of
woman
voice
which
screamed
in
french
my
waiting
is
not
in
vain
at
last
at
last
have
found
you
with
her
there
was
savage
struggle
saw
him
with
chair
in
his
hand
knife
gleamed
in
hers
rushed
from
the
horrible
scene
ran
from
the
house
and
only
next
morning
in
the
paper
did
learn
the
dreadful
result
that
night
was
happy
for
had
my
letter
and
had
not
seen
yet
what
the
future
would
bring
it
was
the
next
morning
that
realized
that
had
only
exchanged
one
trouble
for
another
my
husband
anguish
at
the
loss
of
his
paper
went
to
my
heart
could
hardly
prevent
myself
from
there
and
then
kneeling
down
at
his
feet
and
telling
him
what
had
done
but
that
again
would
mean
confession
of
the
past
came
to
you
that
morning
in
order
to
understand
the
full
enormity
of
my
offence
from
the
instant
that
grasped
it
my
whole
mind
was
turned
to
the
one
thought
of
getting
back
my
husband
paper
it
must
still
be
where
lucas
had
placed
it
for
it
was
concealed
before
this
dreadful
woman
entered
the
room
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
coming
should
not
have
known
where
his
hiding
place
was
how
was
to
get
into
the
room
for
two
days
watched
the
place
but
the
door
was
never
left
open
last
night
made
last
attempt
what
did
and
how
succeeded
you
have
already
learned
brought
the
paper
back
with
me
and
thought
of
destroying
it
since
could
see
no
way
of
returning
it
without
confessing
my
guilt
to
my
husband
heavens
hear
his
step
upon
the
stair
the
european
secretary
burst
excitedly
into
the
room
any
news
mr
holmes
any
news
he
cried
have
some
hopes
ah
thank
heaven
his
face
became
radiant
the
prime
minister
is
lunching
with
me
may
he
share
your
hopes
he
has
nerves
of
steel
and
yet
know
that
he
has
hardly
slept
since
this
terrible
event
jacobs
will
you
ask
the
prime
minister
to
come
up
as
to
you
dear
fear
that
this
is
matter
of
politics
we
will
join
you
in
few
minutes
in
the
dining
room
the
prime
minister
manner
was
subdued
but
could
see
by
the
gleam
of
his
eyes
and
the
twitchings
of
his
bony
hands
that
he
shared
the
excitement
of
his
young
colleague
understand
that
you
have
something
to
report
mr
holmes
purely
negative
as
yet
my
friend
answered
have
inquired
at
every
point
where
it
might
be
and
am
sure
that
there
is
no
danger
to
be
apprehended
but
that
is
not
enough
mr
holmes
we
cannot
live
for
ever
on
such
volcano
we
must
have
something
definite
am
in
hopes
of
getting
it
that
is
why
am
here
the
more
think
of
the
matter
the
more
convinced
am
that
the
letter
has
never
left
this
house
mr
holmes
if
it
had
it
would
certainly
have
been
public
by
now
but
why
should
anyone
take
it
in
order
to
keep
it
in
his
house
am
not
convinced
that
anyone
did
take
it
then
how
could
it
leave
the
despatch
box
am
not
convinced
that
it
ever
did
leave
the
despatch
box
mr
holmes
this
joking
is
very
ill
timed
you
have
my
assurance
that
it
left
the
box
have
you
examined
the
box
since
tuesday
morning
no
it
was
not
necessary
you
may
conceivably
have
overlooked
it
impossible
say
but
am
not
convinced
of
it
have
known
such
things
to
happen
presume
there
are
other
papers
there
well
it
may
have
got
mixed
with
them
it
was
on
the
top
someone
may
have
shaken
the
box
and
displaced
it
no
had
everything
out
surely
it
is
easily
decided
hope
said
the
premier
let
us
have
the
despatch
box
brought
in
the
secretary
rang
the
bell
jacobs
bring
down
my
despatch
box
this
is
farcical
waste
of
time
but
still
if
nothing
else
will
satisfy
you
it
shall
be
done
thank
you
jacobs
put
it
here
have
always
had
the
key
on
my
watch
chain
here
are
the
papers
you
see
letter
from
lord
merrow
report
from
sir
charles
hardy
memorandum
from
belgrade
note
on
the
russo
german
grain
taxes

from

from
lord
flowers
good
heavens
what
is
this
lord
bellinger
lord
bellinger
the
premier
snatched
the
blue
envelope
from
his
hand
yes
it
is
it
and
the
letter
is
intact
hope
congratulate
you
thank
you
thank
you
what
weight
from
my
heart
but
this
is
inconceivable
impossible
mr
holmes
you
are
wizard
sorcerer
how
did
you
know
it
was
there
because
knew
it
was
nowhere
else
cannot
believe
my
eyes
he
ran
wildly
to
the
door
where
is
my
wife
must
tell
her
that
all
is
well
hilda
we
heard
his
voice
on
the
stairs
the
premier
looked
at
holmes
with
twinkling
eyes
come
sir
said
he
there
is
more
in
this
than
meets
the
eye
how
came
the
letter
back
in
the
box
holmes
turned
away
smiling
from
the
keen
scrutiny
of
those
wonderful
eyes
we
also
have
our
diplomatic
secrets
said
he
and
picking
up
his
hat
he
turned
to
the
door
his
last
bow
1917
the
adventure
of
the
cardboard
box
in
choosing
few
typical
cases
which
illustrate
the
remarkable
mental
qualities
of
my
friend
sherlock
holmes
have
endeavoured
as
far
as
possible
to
select
those
which
presented
the
minimum
of
sensationalism
while
offering
fair
field
for
his
talents
it
is
however
unfortunately
impossible
entirely
to
separate
the
sensational
from
the
criminal
and
chronicler
is
left
in
the
dilemma
that
he
must
either
sacrifice
details
which
are
essential
to
his
statement
and
so
give
false
impression
of
the
problem
or
he
must
use
matter
which
chance
and
not
choice
has
provided
him
with
this
short
preface
shall
turn
to
my
notes
of
what
proved
to
be
strange
though
peculiarly
terrible
chain
of
events
it
was
blazing
hot
day
in
august
baker
street
was
like
an
oven
and
the
glare
of
the
sunlight
upon
the
yellow
brickwork
of
the
house
across
the
road
was
painful
to
the
eye
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
these
were
the
same
walls
which
loomed
so
gloomily
through
the
fogs
of
winter
our
blinds
were
half
drawn
and
holmes
lay
curled
upon
the
sofa
reading
and
re
reading
letter
which
he
had
received
by
the
morning
post
for
myself
my
term
of
service
in
india
had
trained
me
to
stand
heat
better
than
cold
and
thermometer
at
ninety
was
no
hardship
but
the
morning
paper
was
uninteresting
parliament
had
risen
everybody
was
out
of
town
and
yearned
for
the
glades
of
the
new
forest
or
the
shingle
of
southsea
depleted
bank
account
had
caused
me
to
postpone
my
holiday
and
as
to
my
companion
neither
the
country
nor
the
sea
presented
the
slightest
attraction
to
him
he
loved
to
lie
in
the
very
center
of
five
millions
of
people
with
his
filaments
stretching
out
and
running
through
them
responsive
to
every
little
rumour
or
suspicion
of
unsolved
crime
appreciation
of
nature
found
no
place
among
his
many
gifts
and
his
only
change
was
when
he
turned
his
mind
from
the
evil
doer
of
the
town
to
track
down
his
brother
of
the
country

finding
that
holmes
was
too
absorbed
for
conversation
had
tossed
side
the
barren
paper
and
leaning
back
in
my
chair
fell
into
brown
study
suddenly
my
companion
voice
broke
in
upon
my
thoughts
you
are
right
watson
said
he
it
does
seem
most
preposterous
way
of
settling
dispute
most
preposterous
exclaimed
and
then
suddenly
realizing
how
he
had
echoed
the
inmost
thought
of
my
soul
sat
up
in
my
chair
and
stared
at
him
in
blank
amazement
what
is
this
holmes
cried
this
is
beyond
anything
which
could
have
imagined
he
laughed
heartily
at
my
perplexity
you
remember
said
he
that
some
little
time
ago
when
read
you
the
passage
in
one
of
poe
sketches
in
which
close
reasoner
follows
the
unspoken
thoughts
of
his
companion
you
were
inclined
to
treat
the
matter
as
mere
tour
de
force
of
the
author
on
my
remarking
that
was
constantly
in
the
habit
of
doing
the
same
thing
you
expressed
incredulity
oh
no
perhaps
not
with
your
tongue
my
dear
watson
but
certainly
with
your
eyebrows
so
when
saw
you
throw
down
your
paper
and
enter
upon
train
of
thought
was
very
happy
to
have
the
opportunity
of
reading
it
off
and
eventually
of
breaking
into
it
as
proof
that
had
been
in
rapport
with
you
but
was
still
far
from
satisfied
in
the
example
which
you
read
to
me
said
the
reasoner
drew
his
conclusions
from
the
actions
of
the
man
whom
he
observed
if
remember
right
he
stumbled
over
heap
of
stones
looked
up
at
the
stars
and
so
on
but
have
been
seated
quietly
in
my
chair
and
what
clues
can
have
given
you
do
yourself
an
injustice
the
features
are
given
to
man
as
the
means
by
which
he
shall
express
his
emotions
and
yours
are
faithful
servants
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
read
my
train
of
thoughts
from
my
features
your
features
and
especially
your
eyes
perhaps
you
cannot
yourself
recall
how
your
reverie
commenced
no
cannot
then
will
tell
you
after
throwing
down
your
paper
which
was
the
action
which
drew
my
attention
to
you
sat
for
half
minute
with
vacant
expression
then
your
eyes
fixed
themselves
upon
your
newly
framed
picture
of
general
gordon
and
saw
by
the
alteration
in
your
face
that
train
of
thought
had
been
started
but
it
did
not
lead
very
far
your
eyes
flashed
across
tho
the
unframed
portrait
of
henry
ward
beecher
which
stands
upon
the
top
of
your
books
then
you
glanced
up
at
the
wall
and
of
course
your
meaning
was
obvious
you
were
thinking
that
if
the
portrait
were
framed
it
would
just
cover
that
bare
space
and
correspond
with
gordon
picture
there
you
have
followed
me
wonderfully
exclaimed
so
far
could
hardly
have
gone
astray
but
now
your
thoughts
went
back
to
beecher
and
you
looked
hard
across
as
if
you
were
studying
the
character
in
his
features
then
your
eyes
ceased
to
pucker
but
you
continued
to
look
across
and
your
face
was
thoughtful
you
were
recalling
the
incidents
of
beecher
career
was
well
aware
that
you
could
not
do
this
without
thinking
of
the
mission
which
he
undertook
on
behalf
of
the
north
at
the
time
of
the
civil
war
for
remember
your
expressing
your
passionate
indignation
at
the
way
in
which
he
was
received
by
the
more
turbulent
of
our
people
you
felt
so
strongly
about
it
that
knew
you
could
not
think
of
beecher
without
thinking
of
that
also
when
moment
later
saw
your
eyes
wander
away
from
the
picture
suspected
that
your
mind
had
now
turned
to
the
civil
war
and
when
observed
that
your
lips
set
your
eyes
sparkled
and
your
hands
clenched
was
positive
that
you
were
indeed
thinking
of
the
gallantry
which
was
shown
by
both
sides
in
that
desperate
struggle
but
then
again
your
face
grew
sadder
you
shook
your
head
you
were
dwelling
upon
the
sadness
and
horror
and
useless
waste
of
life
your
hand
stole
towards
your
own
old
wound
and
smile
quivered
on
your
lips
which
showed
me
that
the
ridiculous
side
of
this
method
of
settling
international
questions
had
forced
itself
upon
your
mind
at
this
point
agreed
with
you
that
it
was
preposterous
and
was
glad
to
find
that
all
my
deductions
had
been
correct
absolutely
said
and
now
that
you
have
explained
it
confess
that
am
as
amazed
as
before
it
was
very
superficial
my
dear
watson
assure
you
should
not
have
intruded
it
upon
your
attention
had
you
not
shown
some
incredulity
the
other
day
but
have
in
my
hands
here
little
problem
which
may
prove
to
be
more
difficult
of
solution
than
my
small
essay
thought
reading
have
you
observed
in
the
paper
short
paragraph
referring
to
the
remarkable
contents
of
packet
sent
through
the
post
to
miss
cushing
of
cross
street
croydon
no
saw
nothing
ah
then
you
must
have
overlooked
it
just
toss
it
over
to
me
here
it
is
under
the
financial
column
perhaps
you
would
be
good
enough
to
read
it
aloud
picked
up
the
paper
which
he
had
thrown
back
to
me
and
read
the
paragraph
indicated
it
was
headed
gruesome
packet
miss
susan
cushing
living
at
cross
street
croydon
has
been
made
the
victim
of
what
must
be
regarded
as
peculiarly
revolting
practical
joke
unless
some
more
sinister
meaning
should
prove
to
be
attached
to
the
incident
at
two
clock
yesterday
afternoon
small
packet
wrapped
in
brown
paper
was
handed
in
by
the
postman
cardboard
box
was
inside
which
was
filled
with
coarse
salt
on
emptying
this
miss
cushing
was
horrified
to
find
two
human
ears
apparently
quite
freshly
severed
the
box
had
been
sent
by
parcel
post
from
belfast
upon
the
morning
before
there
is
no
indication
as
to
the
sender
and
the
matter
is
the
more
mysterious
as
miss
cushing
who
is
maiden
lady
of
fifty
has
led
most
retired
life
and
has
so
few
acquaintances
or
corespondents
that
it
is
rare
event
for
her
to
receive
anything
through
the
post
some
years
ago
however
when
she
resided
at
penge
she
let
apartments
in
her
house
to
three
young
medical
students
whom
she
was
obliged
to
get
rid
of
on
account
of
their
noisy
and
irregular
habits
the
police
are
of
opinion
that
this
outrage
may
have
been
perpetrated
upon
miss
cushing
by
these
youths
who
owed
her
grudge
and
who
hoped
to
frighten
her
by
sending
her
these
relics
of
the
dissecting
rooms
some
probability
is
lent
to
the
theory
by
the
fact
that
one
of
these
students
came
from
the
north
of
ireland
and
to
the
best
of
miss
cushing
belief
from
belfast
in
the
meantime
the
matter
is
being
actively
investigated
mr
lestrade
one
of
the
very
smartest
of
our
detective
officers
being
in
charge
of
the
case
so
much
for
the
daily
chronicle
said
holmes
as
finished
reading
now
for
our
friend
lestrade
had
note
from
him
this
morning
in
which
he
says
think
that
this
case
is
very
much
in
your
line
we
have
every
hope
of
clearing
the
matter
up
but
we
find
little
difficulty
in
getting
anything
to
work
upon
we
have
of
course
wired
to
the
belfast
post
office
but
large
number
of
parcels
were
handed
in
upon
that
day
and
they
have
no
means
of
identifying
this
particular
one
or
of
remembering
the
sender
the
box
is
half
pound
box
of
honeydew
tobacco
and
does
not
help
us
in
any
way
the
medical
student
theory
still
appears
to
me
to
be
the
most
feasible
but
if
you
should
have
few
hours
to
spare
should
be
very
happy
to
see
you
out
here
shall
be
either
at
the
house
or
in
the
police
station
all
day
what
say
you
watson
can
you
rise
superior
to
the
heat
and
run
down
to
croydon
with
me
on
the
off
chance
of
case
for
your
annals
was
longing
for
something
to
do
you
shall
have
it
then
ring
for
our
boots
and
tell
them
to
order
cab
ll
be
back
in
moment
when
have
changed
my
dressing
gown
and
filled
my
cigar
case
shower
of
rain
fell
while
we
were
in
the
train
and
the
heat
was
far
less
oppressive
in
croydon
than
in
town
holmes
had
sent
on
wire
so
that
lestrade
as
wiry
as
dapper
and
as
ferretlike
as
ever
was
waiting
for
us
at
the
station
walk
of
five
minutes
took
us
to
cross
street
where
miss
cushing
resided
it
was
very
long
street
of
two
story
brick
houses
neat
and
prim
with
whitened
stone
steps
and
little
groups
of
aproned
women
gossiping
at
the
doors
halfway
down
lestrade
stopped
and
tapped
at
door
which
was
opened
by
small
servant
girl
miss
cushing
was
sitting
in
the
front
room
into
which
we
were
ushered
she
was
placid
faced
woman
with
large
gentle
eyes
and
grizzled
hair
curving
down
over
her
temples
on
each
side
worked
antimacassar
lay
upon
her
lap
and
basket
of
coloured
silks
stood
upon
stool
beside
her
they
are
in
the
outhouse
those
dreadful
things
said
she
as
lestrade
entered
wish
that
you
would
take
them
away
altogether
so
shall
miss
cushing
only
kept
them
here
until
my
friend
mr
holmes
should
have
seen
them
in
your
presence
why
in
my
presence
sir
in
case
he
wished
to
ask
any
questions
what
is
the
use
of
asking
me
questions
when
tell
you
know
nothing
whatever
about
it

quite
so
madam
said
holmes
in
his
soothing
way
have
no
doubt
that
you
have
been
annoyed
more
than
enough
already
over
this
business
indeed
have
sir
am
quiet
woman
and
live
retired
life
it
is
something
new
for
me
to
see
my
name
in
the
papers
and
to
find
the
police
in
my
house
won
have
those
things
here
mr
lestrade
if
you
wish
to
see
them
you
must
go
to
the
outhouse
it
was
small
shed
in
the
narrow
garden
which
ran
behind
the
house
lestrade
went
in
and
brought
out
yellow
cardboard
box
with
piece
of
brown
paper
and
some
string
there
was
bench
at
the
end
of
the
path
and
we
all
sat
down
while
homes
examined
one
by
one
the
articles
which
lestrade
had
handed
to
him
the
string
is
exceedingly
interesting
he
remarked
holding
it
up
to
the
light
and
sniffing
at
it
what
do
you
make
of
this
string
lestrade
it
has
been
tarred
precisely
it
is
piece
of
tarred
twine
you
have
also
no
doubt
remarked
that
miss
cushing
has
cut
the
cord
with
scissors
as
can
be
seen
by
the
double
fray
on
each
side
this
is
of
importance
cannot
see
the
importance
said
lestrade
the
importance
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
knot
is
left
intact
and
that
this
knot
is
of
peculiar
character
it
is
very
neatly
tied
had
already
made
note
of
that
effect
said
lestrade
complacently
so
much
for
the
string
then
said
holmes
smiling
now
for
the
box
wrapper
brown
paper
with
distinct
smell
of
coffee
what
did
you
not
observe
it
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
it
address
printed
in
rather
straggling
characters
miss
cushing
cross
street
croydon
done
with
broad
pointed
pen
probably
and
with
very
inferior
ink
the
word
croydon
has
been
originally
spelled
with
an
which
has
been
changed
to
the
parcel
was
directed
then
by
man
the
printing
is
distinctly
masculine
of
limited
education
and
unacquainted
with
the
town
of
croydon
so
far
so
good
the
box
is
yellow
half
pound
honeydew
box
with
nothing
distinctive
save
two
thumb
marks
at
the
left
bottom
corner
it
is
filled
with
rough
salt
of
the
quality
used
for
preserving
hides
and
other
of
the
coarser
commercial
purposes
and
embedded
in
it
are
these
very
singular
enclosures
he
took
out
the
two
ears
as
he
spoke
and
laying
board
across
his
knee
he
examined
them
minutely
while
lestrade
and
bending
forward
on
each
side
of
him
glanced
alternately
at
these
dreadful
relics
and
at
the
thoughtful
eager
face
of
our
companion
finally
he
returned
them
to
the
box
once
more
and
sat
for
while
in
deep
meditation
you
have
observed
of
course
said
he
at
last
that
the
ears
are
not
pair
yes
have
noticed
that
but
if
this
were
the
practical
joke
of
some
students
from
the
dissecting
rooms
it
would
be
as
easy
for
them
to
send
two
odd
ears
as
pair
precisely
but
this
is
not
practical
joke
you
are
sure
of
it
the
presumption
is
strongly
against
it
bodies
in
the
dissecting
rooms
are
injected
with
preservative
fluid
these
ears
bear
no
signs
of
this
they
are
fresh
too
they
have
been
cut
off
with
blunt
instrument
which
would
hardly
happen
if
student
had
done
it
again
carbolic
or
rectified
spirits
would
be
the
preservatives
which
would
suggest
themselves
to
the
medical
mind
certainly
not
rough
salt
repeat
that
there
is
no
practical
joke
here
but
that
we
are
investigating
serious
crime
vague
thrill
ran
through
me
as
listened
to
my
companion
words
and
saw
the
stern
gravity
which
had
hardened
his
features
this
brutal
preliminary
seemed
to
shadow
forth
some
strange
and
inexplicable
horror
in
the
background
lestrade
however
shook
his
head
like
man
who
is
only
half
convinced
there
are
objections
to
the
joke
theory
no
doubt
said
he
but
there
are
much
stronger
reasons
against
the
other
we
know
that
this
woman
has
led
most
quiet
and
respectable
life
at
penge
and
here
for
the
last
twenty
years
she
has
hardly
been
away
from
her
home
for
day
during
that
time
why
on
earth
then
should
any
criminal
send
her
the
proofs
of
his
guilt
especially
as
unless
she
is
most
consummate
actress
she
understands
quite
as
little
of
the
matter
as
we
do
that
is
the
problem
which
we
have
to
solve
holmes
answered
and
for
my
part
shall
set
about
it
by
presuming
that
my
reasoning
is
correct
and
that
double
murder
has
been
committed
one
of
these
ears
is
woman
small
finely
formed
and
pierced
for
an
earring
the
other
is
man
sun
burned
discoloured
and
also
pierced
for
an
earring
these
two
people
are
presumably
dead
or
we
should
have
heard
their
story
before
now
to
day
is
friday
the
packet
was
posted
on
thursday
morning
the
tragedy
then
occurred
on
wednesday
or
tuesday
or
earlier
if
the
two
people
were
murdered
who
but
their
murderer
would
have
sent
this
sign
of
his
work
to
miss
cushing
we
may
take
it
that
the
sender
of
the
packet
is
the
man
whom
we
want
but
he
must
have
some
strong
reason
for
sending
miss
cushing
this
packet
what
reason
then
it
must
have
been
to
tell
her
that
the
deed
was
done
or
to
pain
her
perhaps
but
in
that
case
she
knows
who
it
is
does
she
know
doubt
it
if
she
knew
why
should
she
cal
the
police
in
she
might
have
buried
the
ears
and
no
one
would
have
been
the
wiser
that
is
what
she
would
have
done
if
she
had
wished
to
shield
the
criminal
but
if
she
does
not
wish
to
shield
him
she
would
give
his
name
there
is
tangle
here
which
needs
straightening
to
he
had
been
talking
in
high
quick
voice
staring
blankly
up
over
the
garden
fence
but
now
he
sprang
briskly
to
his
feet
and
walked
towards
the
house
have
few
questions
to
ask
miss
cushing
said
he
in
that
case
may
leave
you
here
said
lestrade
for
have
another
small
business
on
hand
think
that
have
nothing
further
to
learn
form
miss
cushing
you
will
find
me
at
the
police
station
we
shall
look
in
on
our
way
to
the
train
answered
holmes
moment
later
he
and
were
back
in
the
front
room
where
the
impassive
lady
was
still
quietly
working
away
at
her
antimacassar
she
put
it
down
on
her
lap
as
we
entered
and
looked
at
us
with
her
frank
searching
blue
eyes
am
convinced
sir
she
said
that
this
matter
is
mistake
and
that
the
parcel
was
never
meant
for
me
at
all
have
said
this
several
times
to
the
gentlemen
from
scotland
yard
but
he
simply
laughs
at
me
have
not
an
enemy
in
the
world
as
far
as
know
so
why
should
anyone
play
me
such
trick
am
coming
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
miss
cushing
said
holmes
taking
seat
beside
her
think
that
it
is
more
than
probable—
he
paused
and
was
surprised
on
glancing
round
to
see
that
he
was
staring
with
singular
intentness
at
the
lady
profile
surprise
and
satisfaction
were
both
for
an
instant
to
be
read
upon
his
eager
face
though
when
she
glanced
round
to
find
out
the
cause
of
his
silence
he
had
become
as
demure
as
ever
stared
hard
myself
at
her
flat
grizzled
hair
her
trim
cap
her
little
gilt
earrings
her
placid
features
but
could
see
nothing
which
could
account
for
my
companion
evident
excitement
there
were
one
or
two
questions—
oh
am
weary
of
questions
cried
miss
cushing
impatiently
you
have
two
sisters
believe
how
could
you
know
that
observed
the
very
instant
that
entered
the
room
that
you
have
portrait
group
of
three
ladies
upon
the
mantelpiece
one
of
whom
is
undoubtedly
yourself
while
the
others
are
so
exceedingly
like
you
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
relationship
yes
you
are
quite
right
those
are
my
sisters
sarah
and
mary
and
here
at
my
elbow
is
another
portrait
taken
at
liverpool
of
your
younger
sister
in
the
company
of
man
who
appears
to
be
steward
by
his
uniform
observe
that
she
was
unmarried
at
the
time
you
are
very
quick
at
observing
that
is
my
trade
well
you
are
quite
right
but
she
was
married
to
mr
browner
few
days
afterwards
he
was
on
the
south
american
line
when
that
was
taken
but
he
was
so
fond
of
her
that
he
couldn
abide
to
leave
her
for
so
long
and
he
got
into
the
liverpool
and
london
boats
ah
the
conqueror
perhaps
no
the
may
day
when
last
heard
jim
came
down
here
to
see
me
once
that
was
before
he
broke
the
pledge
but
afterwards
he
would
always
take
drink
when
he
was
ashore
and
little
drink
would
send
him
stark
staring
mad
ah
it
was
bad
day
that
ever
he
took
glass
in
his
hand
again
first
he
dropped
me
then
he
quarrelled
with
sarah
and
now
that
mary
has
stopped
writing
we
don
know
how
things
are
going
with
them
it
was
evident
that
miss
cushing
had
come
upon
subject
on
which
she
felt
very
deeply
like
most
people
who
lead
lonely
life
she
was
shy
at
first
but
ended
by
becoming
extremely
communicative
she
told
us
many
details
about
her
brother
in
law
the
steward
and
then
wandering
off
on
the
subject
of
her
former
lodgers
the
medical
students
she
gave
us
long
account
of
their
delinquencies
with
their
names
and
those
of
their
hospitals
holmes
listened
attentively
to
everything
throwing
in
question
from
time
to
time

about
your
second
sister
sarah
said
he
wonder
since
you
are
both
maiden
ladies
that
you
do
not
keep
house
together
ah
you
don
know
sarah
temper
or
you
would
wonder
no
more
tried
it
when
came
to
croydon
and
we
kept
on
until
about
two
months
ago
when
we
had
to
part
don
want
to
say
word
against
my
own
sister
but
she
was
always
meddlesome
and
hard
to
please
was
sarah
you
say
that
she
quarrelled
with
your
liverpool
relations
yes
and
they
were
the
best
of
friends
at
one
time
why
she
went
up
there
to
live
in
order
to
be
near
them
and
now
she
has
no
word
hard
enough
for
jim
browner
the
last
six
months
that
she
was
here
she
would
speak
of
nothing
but
his
drinking
and
his
ways
he
had
caught
her
meddling
suspect
and
given
her
bit
of
his
mind
and
that
was
the
start
of
it
thank
you
miss
cushing
said
holmes
rising
and
bowing
your
sister
sarah
lives
think
you
said
at
new
street
wallington
good
bye
and
am
very
sorry
that
you
should
have
been
troubled
over
case
with
which
as
you
say
you
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
there
was
cab
passing
as
we
came
out
and
holmes
hailed
it
how
far
to
wallington
he
asked
only
about
mile
sir
very
good
jump
in
watson
we
must
strike
while
the
iron
is
hot
simple
as
the
case
is
there
have
been
one
or
two
very
instructive
details
in
connection
with
it
just
pull
up
at
telegraph
office
as
you
pass
cabby
holmes
sent
off
short
wire
and
for
the
rest
of
the
drive
lay
back
in
the
cab
with
his
hat
tilted
over
his
nose
to
keep
the
sun
from
his
face
our
drive
pulled
up
at
house
which
was
not
unlike
the
one
which
we
had
just
quitted
my
companion
ordered
him
to
wait
and
had
his
hand
upon
the
knocker
when
the
door
opened
and
grave
young
gentleman
in
black
with
very
shiny
hat
appeared
on
the
step
is
miss
cushing
at
home
asked
holmes
miss
sarah
cushing
is
extremely
ill
said
he
she
has
been
suffering
since
yesterday
from
brain
symptoms
of
great
severity
as
her
medical
adviser
cannot
possibly
take
the
responsibility
of
allowing
anyone
to
see
her
should
recommend
you
to
call
again
in
ten
days
he
drew
on
his
gloves
closed
the
door
and
marched
off
down
the
street
well
if
we
can
we
can
said
holmes
cheerfully
perhaps
she
could
not
or
would
not
have
told
you
much
did
not
wish
her
to
tell
me
anything
only
wanted
to
look
at
her
however
think
that
have
got
all
that
want
drive
us
to
some
decent
hotel
cabby
where
we
may
have
some
lunch
and
afterwards
we
shall
drop
down
upon
friend
lestrade
at
the
policestation
we
had
pleasant
little
meal
together
during
which
holmes
would
talk
about
nothing
but
violins
narrating
with
great
exultation
how
he
had
purchased
his
own
stradivarius
which
was
worth
at
least
five
hundred
guineas
at
jew
broker
in
tottenham
court
road
for
fifty
five
shillings
this
led
him
to
paganini
and
we
sat
for
an
hour
over
bottle
of
claret
while
he
told
me
anecdote
after
anecdote
of
that
extraordinary
man
the
afternoon
was
far
advanced
and
the
hot
glare
had
softened
into
mellow
glow
before
we
found
ourselves
at
the
police
station
lestrade
was
waiting
for
us
at
the
door
telegram
for
you
mr
holmes
said
he
ha
it
is
the
answer
he
tore
it
open
glanced
his
eyes
over
it
and
crumpled
it
into
his
pocket
that
all
right
said
he
have
you
found
out
anything
have
found
out
everything
what
lestrade
stared
at
him
in
amazement
you
are
joking
was
never
more
serious
in
my
life
shocking
crime
has
been
committed
and
think
have
now
laid
bare
every
detail
of
it
and
the
criminal
holmes
scribbled
few
words
upon
the
back
of
one
of
his
visiting
cards
and
threw
it
over
to
lestrade
that
is
the
name
he
said
you
cannot
effect
an
arrest
until
to
morrow
night
at
the
earliest
should
prefer
that
you
do
not
mention
my
name
at
all
in
connection
with
the
case
as
choose
to
be
only
associated
with
those
crimes
which
present
some
difficulty
in
their
solution
come
on
watson
we
strode
off
together
to
the
station
leaving
lestrade
still
staring
with
delighted
face
at
the
card
which
holmes
had
thrown
him
the
case
said
sherlock
holmes
as
we
chatted
over
or
cigars
that
night
in
our
rooms
at
baker
street
is
one
where
as
in
the
investigations
which
you
have
chronicled
under
the
names
of
study
in
scarlet
and
of
the
sign
of
four
we
have
been
compelled
to
reason
backward
from
effects
to
causes
have
written
to
lestrade
asking
him
to
supply
us
with
the
details
which
are
now
wanting
and
which
he
will
only
get
after
he
had
secured
his
man
that
he
may
be
safely
trusted
to
do
for
although
he
is
absolutely
devoid
of
reason
he
is
as
tenacious
as
bulldog
when
he
once
understands
what
he
has
to
do
and
indeed
it
is
just
this
tenacity
which
has
brought
him
to
the
top
at
scotland
yard
your
case
is
not
complete
then
asked
it
is
fairly
complete
in
essentials
we
know
who
the
author
of
the
revolting
business
is
although
one
of
the
victims
still
escapes
us
of
course
you
have
formed
your
own
conclusions
presume
that
this
jim
browner
the
steward
of
liverpool
boat
is
the
man
whom
you
suspect
oh
it
is
more
than
suspicion
and
yet
cannot
see
anything
save
very
vague
indications
on
the
contrary
to
my
mind
nothing
could
be
more
clear
let
me
run
over
the
principal
steps
we
approached
the
case
you
remember
with
an
absolutely
blank
mind
which
is
always
an
advantage
we
had
formed
no
theories
we
were
simply
there
to
observe
and
to
draw
inferences
from
our
observations
what
did
we
see
first
very
placid
and
respectable
lady
who
seemed
quite
innocent
of
any
secret
and
portrait
which
showed
me
that
she
had
two
younger
sisters
it
instantly
flashed
across
my
mind
that
the
box
might
have
been
meant
for
one
of
these
set
the
idea
aside
as
one
which
could
be
disproved
or
confirmed
at
our
leisure
then
we
went
to
the
garden
as
you
remember
and
we
saw
the
very
singular
contents
of
the
little
yellow
box
the
string
was
of
the
quality
which
is
used
by
sail
makers
aboard
ship
and
at
once
whiff
of
the
sea
was
perceptible
in
our
investigation
when
observed
that
the
knot
was
one
which
is
popular
with
sailors
that
the
parcel
had
been
posted
at
port
and
that
the
male
ear
was
pierced
for
an
earring
which
is
so
much
more
common
among
sailors
than
landsmen
was
quite
certain
that
all
the
actors
in
the
tragedy
were
to
be
found
among
our
seafaring
classes
when
came
to
examine
the
address
of
the
packet
observed
that
it
was
to
miss
cushing
now
the
oldest
sister
would
of
course
be
miss
cushing
and
although
her
initial
was
it
might
belong
to
one
of
the
others
as
well
in
that
case
we
should
have
to
commence
our
investigation
from
fresh
basis
altogether
therefore
went
into
the
house
with
the
intention
of
clearing
up
this
point
was
about
to
assure
miss
cushing
that
was
convinced
that
mistake
had
been
made
when
you
may
remember
that
came
suddenly
to
stop
the
fact
was
that
had
just
seen
something
which
filled
me
with
surprise
and
at
the
same
time
narrowed
the
field
of
our
inquiry
immensely
as
medical
man
you
are
aware
watson
that
there
is
no
part
of
the
body
which
varies
so
much
as
the
human
ear
each
ear
is
as
rule
quite
distinctive
and
differs
from
all
other
ones
in
last
year
anthropological
journal
you
will
find
two
short
monographs
from
my
pen
upon
the
subject
had
therefore
examined
the
ears
in
the
box
with
the
eyes
of
an
expert
and
had
carefully
noted
their
anatomical
peculiarities
imagine
my
surprise
then
when
on
looking
at
miss
cushing
perceived
that
her
ear
corresponded
exactly
with
the
female
ear
which
had
just
inspected
the
matter
was
entirely
beyond
coincidence
there
was
the
same
shortening
of
the
pinna
the
same
broad
curve
of
the
upper
lobe
the
same
convolution
of
the
inner
cartilage
in
all
essentials
it
was
the
same
ear
in
the
first
place
her
sister
name
was
sarah
and
her
address
had
until
recently
been
the
same
so
that
it
was
quite
obvious
how
the
mistake
had
occurred
and
for
whom
the
packet
was
meant
then
we
heard
of
this
steward
married
to
the
third
sister
and
learned
that
he
had
at
one
time
been
so
intimate
with
miss
sarah
that
she
had
actually
gone
up
to
liverpool
to
be
near
the
browners
but
quarrel
had
afterwards
divided
them
this
quarrel
had
put
stop
to
all
communications
for
some
months
so
that
if
browner
had
occasion
to
address
packet
to
miss
sarah
he
would
undoubtedly
have
done
so
to
her
old
address
and
now
the
matter
had
begun
to
straighten
itself
out
wonderfully
we
had
learned
of
the
existence
of
this
steward
an
impulsive
man
of
strong
passions
you
remember
that
he
threw
up
what
must
have
been
very
superior
berth
in
order
to
be
nearer
to
his
wife
subject
too
to
occasional
fits
of
hard
drinking
we
had
reason
to
believe
that
his
wife
had
been
murdered
and
that
man
presumably
seafaring
man
had
been
murdered
at
the
same
time
jealousy
of
course
at
once
suggests
itself
as
the
motive
for
the
crime
and
why
should
these
proofs
of
the
deed
be
sent
to
miss
sarah
cushing
probably
because
during
her
residence
in
liverpool
she
had
some
hand
in
bringing
about
the
events
which
led
to
the
tragedy
you
will
observe
that
this
line
of
boats
call
at
belfast
dublin
and
waterford
so
that
presuming
that
browner
had
committed
the
deed
and
had
embarked
at
once
upon
his
steamer
the
may
day
belfast
would
be
the
first
place
at
which
he
cold
post
his
terrible
packet

second
solution
was
at
this
stage
obviously
possible
and
although
thought
it
exceedingly
unlikely
was
determined
to
elucidate
it
before
going
further
an
unsuccessful
lover
might
have
killed
mr
and
mrs
browner
and
the
male
ear
might
have
belonged
to
the
husband
there
were
many
grave
objections
to
this
theory
but
it
was
conceivable
therefore
sent
off
telegram
to
my
friend
algar
of
the
liverpool
force
and
asked
him
to
find
our
if
mrs
browner
were
at
home
and
if
browner
had
departed
in
the
may
day
then
we
went
on
to
wallington
to
visit
miss
sarah
was
curious
in
the
first
place
to
see
how
far
the
family
ear
had
been
reproduced
in
her
then
of
course
she
might
give
us
very
important
information
but
was
not
sanguine
that
she
would
she
must
have
heard
of
the
business
the
day
before
since
all
croydon
was
ringing
with
it
and
she
alone
could
have
understood
for
whom
the
packet
was
meant
if
she
had
been
willing
to
help
justice
she
would
probably
have
communicated
with
the
police
already
however
it
was
clearly
our
duty
to
see
her
so
we
went
we
found
that
the
news
of
the
arrival
of
the
packet
for
her
illness
dated
from
that
time
had
such
an
effect
upon
her
as
to
bring
on
brain
fever
it
was
clearer
than
ever
that
she
understood
its
full
significance
but
equally
clear
that
we
should
have
to
wait
some
time
for
any
assistance
from
her
however
we
were
really
independent
of
her
help
our
answers
were
waiting
for
us
at
the
police
station
where
had
directed
algar
to
send
them
nothing
could
be
more
conclusive
mrs
browner
house
had
been
closed
for
more
than
three
days
and
the
neighbours
were
of
opinion
that
she
had
gone
south
to
see
her
relatives
it
had
been
ascertained
at
the
shipping
offices
that
browner
had
left
aboard
of
the
may
day
and
calculate
that
she
is
due
in
the
thames
tomorrow
night
when
he
arrives
he
will
be
met
by
the
obtuse
but
resolute
lestrade
and
have
no
doubt
that
we
shall
have
all
our
details
filled
in
sherlock
holmes
was
not
disappointed
in
his
expectations
two
days
later
he
received
bulky
envelope
which
contained
short
note
form
the
detective
and
typewritten
document
which
covered
several
pages
of
foolscap
lestrade
has
got
him
all
right
said
holmes
glancing
up
at
me
perhaps
it
would
interest
you
to
hear
what
he
says
my
dear
mr
holmes
in
accordance
with
the
scheme
which
we
had
formed
in
order
to
test
our
theories
the
we
is
rather
fine
watson
is
it
not
went
down
to
the
albert
dock
yesterday
at
and
boarded
the
may
day
belonging
to
the
liverpool
dublin
and
london
steam
packet
company
on
inquiry
found
that
there
was
steward
on
board
of
the
name
of
james
browner
and
that
he
had
acted
during
the
voyage
in
such
an
extraordinary
manner
that
the
captain
had
been
compelled
to
relieve
him
of
his
duties
on
descending
to
his
berth
found
him
seated
upon
chest
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
hands
rocking
himself
to
and
fro
he
is
big
powerful
chap
clean
shaven
and
very
swarthy
something
like
aldrige
who
helped
us
in
the
bogus
laundry
affair
he
jumped
up
when
he
heard
my
business
and
had
my
whistle
to
my
lips
to
call
couple
of
river
police
who
were
round
the
corner
but
he
seemed
to
have
no
heart
in
him
and
he
held
out
his
hands
quietly
enough
for
the
darbies
we
brought
him
along
to
the
cells
and
his
box
as
well
for
we
thought
there
might
be
something
incriminating
but
bar
big
sharp
knife
such
as
most
sailors
have
we
got
nothing
for
our
trouble
however
we
find
that
we
shall
want
no
more
evidence
for
on
being
brought
before
the
inspector
at
the
station
he
asked
leave
to
make
statement
which
was
of
course
taken
down
just
as
he
made
it
by
our
shorthand
man
we
had
three
copies
typewritten
one
of
which
enclose
the
affair
proves
as
always
thought
it
would
to
be
an
extremely
simple
one
but
am
obliged
to
you
for
assisting
me
in
my
investigation
with
kind
regards
yours
very
truly
lestrade
hum
the
investigation
really
was
very
simple
one
remarked
holmes
but
don
think
it
struck
him
in
that
light
when
he
first
called
us
in
however
let
us
see
what
jim
browner
has
to
say
for
himself
this
is
his
statement
as
made
before
inspector
montgomery
at
the
shadwell
police
station
and
it
has
the
advantage
of
being
verbatim
have
anything
to
say
yes
have
deal
to
say
have
to
make
clean
breast
of
it
all
you
can
hang
me
or
you
can
leave
me
alone
don
care
plug
which
you
do
tell
you
ve
not
shut
an
eye
in
sleep
since
did
it
and
don
believe
ever
will
again
until
get
past
all
waking
sometimes
it
his
face
but
most
generally
it
hers
never
without
one
or
the
other
before
me
he
looks
frowning
and
black
like
but
she
has
kind
surprise
upon
her
face
ay
the
white
lamb
she
might
well
be
surprised
when
she
read
death
on
face
that
had
seldom
looked
anything
but
love
upon
her
before
but
it
was
sarah
fault
and
may
the
curse
of
broken
man
put
blight
on
her
and
set
the
blood
rotting
in
her
veins
it
not
that
want
to
clear
myself
know
that
went
back
to
drink
like
the
beast
that
was
but
she
would
have
forgiven
me
she
wold
have
stuck
as
close
to
me
rope
to
block
if
that
woman
had
never
darkened
our
door
for
sarah
cushing
loved
me
that
the
root
of
the
business
she
loved
me
until
all
her
love
turned
to
poisonous
hate
when
she
knew
that
thought
more
of
my
wife
footmark
in
the
mud
than
did
of
her
whole
body
and
soul
there
were
three
sisters
altogether
the
old
one
was
just
good
woman
the
second
was
devil
and
the
third
was
an
angel
sarah
was
thirty
three
and
mary
was
twenty
nine
when
married
we
were
just
as
happy
as
the
day
was
long
when
we
set
up
house
together
and
in
all
liverpool
there
was
no
better
woman
than
my
mary
and
then
we
asked
sarah
up
for
week
and
the
week
grew
into
month
and
one
thing
led
to
another
until
she
was
just
one
of
ourselves
in
was
blue
ribbon
at
that
time
and
we
were
putting
little
money
by
and
all
was
as
bright
as
new
dollar
my
god
whoever
would
have
thought
that
it
cold
have
come
to
this
whoever
would
have
dreamed
it
used
to
be
home
for
the
week
ends
very
often
and
sometimes
if
the
ship
were
held
back
for
cargo
would
have
whole
week
at
time
and
in
this
way
saw
deal
of
my
sister
in
law
sarah
she
was
fine
tall
woman
black
and
quick
and
fierce
with
proud
way
of
carrying
her
head
and
glint
from
her
eye
like
spark
from
flint
but
when
little
mary
was
there
had
never
thought
of
her
and
that
swear
as
hope
for
god
mercy
it
had
seemed
to
me
sometimes
that
she
liked
to
be
alone
with
me
or
to
coax
me
out
for
walk
with
her
but
had
never
thought
anything
of
that
but
one
evening
my
eyes
were
opened
had
come
up
form
the
ship
and
found
my
wife
out
but
sarah
at
home
where
mary
asked
oh
she
has
gone
to
pay
some
accounts
was
impatient
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
can
you
be
happy
for
five
minutes
without
mary
jim
says
she
it
bad
compliment
to
me
that
you
can
be
contented
with
my
society
for
so
short
time
that
all
right
my
lass
said
putting
out
my
hand
towards
her
in
kindly
way
but
she
had
it
in
both
hers
in
an
instant
and
they
burned
as
if
they
were
in
fever
looked
into
her
eyes
and
read
it
all
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
speak
nor
for
me
either
frowned
and
drew
my
hand
away
then
she
stood
by
may
side
in
silence
for
bit
and
then
put
up
her
hand
and
patted
me
on
the
shoulder
steady
old
jim
said
she
and
with
kind
mocking
laugh
she
ran
out
of
the
room
well
from
that
time
sarah
hated
me
with
her
whole
heart
and
soul
and
she
is
woman
who
can
hate
too
was
fool
to
let
her
go
on
biding
with
us
besotted
fool
but
never
said
word
to
mary
for
knew
it
would
grieve
her
things
went
on
much
as
before
but
after
time
began
to
find
that
there
was
bit
of
change
in
mary
herself
she
had
always
been
so
trusting
and
so
innocent
but
now
she
became
queer
and
suspicious
wanting
to
know
where
had
been
and
what
had
been
doing
and
whom
my
letters
were
from
and
what
had
in
my
pockets
and
thousand
such
follies
day
by
day
she
grew
queerer
and
more
irritable
and
we
had
ceaseless
rows
about
nothing
was
fairly
puzzled
by
it
all
sarah
avoided
me
now
but
she
and
mary
were
just
inseparable
can
see
now
how
she
was
plotting
and
scheming
and
poisoning
my
wife
mind
against
me
but
was
such
blind
beetle
that
could
not
understand
it
at
the
time
then
broke
my
blue
ribbon
and
began
to
drink
again
but
think
should
not
have
done
it
if
mary
had
been
the
same
as
ever
she
had
some
reason
to
be
disgusted
with
me
now
and
the
gap
between
us
began
to
be
wider
and
wider
and
then
this
alec
fairbairn
chipped
in
and
things
became
thousand
times
blacker
it
was
to
see
sarah
that
he
came
to
my
house
first
but
soon
it
was
to
see
us
for
he
was
man
with
winning
ways
and
he
made
friends
wherever
he
went
he
was
dashing
swaggering
chap
smart
and
curled
who
had
seen
half
the
world
and
could
talk
of
what
he
had
seen
he
was
good
company
won
deny
it
and
he
had
wonderful
polite
ways
with
him
for
sailor
man
so
that
think
there
must
have
been
time
when
he
knew
more
of
the
poop
than
the
forecastle
for
month
he
was
in
and
out
of
my
house
and
never
once
did
it
cross
my
mind
that
harm
might
come
of
his
soft
tricky
ways
and
then
at
last
something
made
me
suspect
and
from
that
day
my
peace
was
gone
forever

it
was
only
little
thing
too
had
come
into
the
parlour
unexpected
and
as
walked
in
at
the
door
saw
light
of
welcome
on
my
wife
face
but
as
she
saw
who
it
was
it
faded
again
and
she
turned
away
with
look
of
disappointment
that
was
enough
for
me
there
was
no
one
but
alec
fairbairn
whose
step
she
could
have
mistaken
for
mine
if
could
have
seen
him
then
should
have
killed
him
for
have
always
been
like
madman
when
my
temper
gets
loose
mary
saw
the
devil
light
in
my
eyes
and
she
ran
forward
with
her
hands
on
my
sleeve
don
jim
don
says
she
where
sarah
asked
in
the
kitchen
says
she
sarah
says
as
went
in
this
man
fairbairn
is
never
to
darken
my
door
again
why
not
says
she
because
order
it
oh
says
she
if
my
friends
are
not
good
enough
for
this
house
then
am
not
good
enough
for
it
either
you
can
do
what
you
like
says
but
if
fairbairn
shows
his
face
here
again
ll
send
you
one
of
his
ears
for
keepsake
she
was
frightened
by
my
face
think
for
she
never
answered
word
and
the
same
evening
she
left
my
house
well
don
know
now
whether
it
was
pure
devilry
on
the
part
of
this
woman
or
whether
she
thought
that
she
could
turn
me
against
my
wife
by
encouraging
her
to
misbehave
anyway
she
took
house
just
two
streets
off
and
let
lodgings
to
sailors
fairbairn
used
to
stay
there
and
mary
would
go
round
to
have
tea
with
her
sister
and
him
how
often
she
went
don
know
but
followed
her
one
day
and
as
broke
in
at
the
door
fairbairn
got
away
over
the
back
garden
wall
like
the
cowardly
skunk
that
he
was
swore
to
my
wife
that
would
kill
her
if
found
her
in
his
company
again
and
led
her
back
with
me
sobbing
and
trembling
and
as
white
as
piece
of
paper
there
was
no
trace
of
love
between
us
any
longer
could
see
that
she
hated
me
and
feared
me
and
when
the
thought
of
it
drove
me
to
drink
then
she
despised
me
as
well
sarah
found
that
she
could
not
make
living
in
liverpool
so
she
went
back
as
understand
to
live
with
her
sister
in
croydon
and
things
jogged
on
much
the
same
as
ever
at
home
and
then
came
this
week
and
all
the
misery
and
ruin
it
was
in
this
way
we
had
gone
on
the
may
day
for
round
voyage
of
seven
days
but
hogshead
got
loose
and
started
one
of
our
plates
so
that
we
had
to
put
back
into
port
for
twelve
hours
left
the
ship
and
came
home
thinking
what
surprise
it
would
be
for
my
wife
and
hoping
that
maybe
she
would
be
glad
to
see
me
so
soon
the
thought
was
in
my
head
as
turned
into
my
own
street
and
at
that
moment
cab
passed
me
and
there
she
was
sitting
by
the
side
of
fairbairn
the
two
chatting
and
laughing
with
never
thought
for
me
as
stood
watching
them
from
the
footpath
tell
you
and
give
you
my
word
for
it
that
from
that
moment
was
not
my
own
master
and
it
is
all
like
dim
dream
when
look
back
on
it
had
been
drinking
hard
of
late
and
the
two
things
together
fairly
turned
my
brain
there
something
throbbing
in
my
head
now
like
docker
hammer
but
that
morning
seemed
to
have
all
niagara
whizzing
and
buzzing
in
my
ears
well
took
to
my
heels
and
ran
after
the
cab
had
heavy
oak
stick
in
my
hand
and
tell
you
saw
red
from
the
first
but
as
ran
got
cunning
too
and
hung
back
little
to
see
them
without
being
seen
they
pulled
up
soon
at
the
railway
station
there
was
good
crowd
round
the
booking
office
so
got
quite
close
to
them
without
being
seen
they
took
tickets
for
new
brighton
so
did
but
got
in
three
carriages
behind
them
when
we
reached
it
they
walked
along
the
parade
and
was
never
more
than
hundred
yards
from
them
at
last
saw
them
hire
boat
and
start
for
row
for
it
was
very
hot
day
and
they
thought
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
cooler
on
the
water
it
was
just
as
if
they
had
been
given
into
my
hands
there
was
bit
of
haze
and
you
could
not
see
more
than
few
hundred
yards
hired
boat
for
myself
and
pulled
after
them
could
see
the
blur
of
their
craft
but
they
were
going
nearly
as
fast
as
and
they
must
have
been
long
mile
from
the
shore
before
caught
them
up
the
haze
was
like
curtain
all
round
us
and
there
were
we
three
in
the
middle
of
it
my
god
shall
ever
forget
their
faces
when
they
saw
who
was
in
the
boat
that
was
closing
in
upon
them
she
screamed
out
he
swore
like
madman
and
jabbed
at
me
with
an
oar
for
he
must
have
seen
death
in
my
eyes
got
past
it
and
got
one
in
with
my
stick
that
crushed
his
head
like
an
egg
would
have
spared
her
perhaps
for
all
my
madness
but
she
threw
her
arms
round
him
crying
out
to
him
and
calling
him
alec
struck
again
and
she
lay
stretched
beside
him
was
like
wild
beast
then
that
had
tasted
blood
if
sarah
had
been
there
by
the
lord
she
should
have
joined
them
pulled
out
my
knife
and
well
there
ve
said
enough
it
gave
me
kind
of
savage
joy
when
thought
how
sarah
would
feel
when
she
had
such
signs
as
these
of
what
her
meddling
had
brought
about
then
tied
the
bodies
into
the
boat
stove
plank
and
stood
by
until
they
had
sunk
knew
very
well
that
the
owner
would
think
that
they
had
lost
their
bearings
in
the
haze
and
had
drifted
off
out
to
sea
cleaned
myself
up
got
back
to
land
and
joined
my
ship
without
soul
having
suspicion
of
what
had
passed
that
night
made
up
the
packet
for
sarah
cushing
and
next
day
sent
it
from
belfast
there
you
have
the
whole
truth
of
it
you
can
hang
me
or
do
what
you
like
with
me
but
you
cannot
punish
me
as
have
been
punished
already
cannot
shut
my
eyes
but
see
those
two
faces
staring
at
me
staring
at
me
as
they
stared
when
my
boat
broke
through
the
haze
killed
them
quick
but
they
are
killing
me
slow
and
if
have
another
night
of
it
shall
be
either
mad
or
dead
before
morning
you
won
put
me
alone
into
cell
sir
for
pity
sake
don
and
may
you
be
treated
in
your
day
of
agony
as
you
treat
me
now
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
watson
said
holmes
solemnly
as
he
laid
down
the
paper
what
object
is
served
by
this
circle
of
misery
and
violence
and
fear
it
must
tend
to
some
end
or
else
our
universe
is
ruled
by
chance
which
is
unthinkable
but
what
end
there
is
the
great
standing
perennial
problem
to
which
human
reason
is
as
far
from
an
answer
as
ever
ii
the
adventure
of
wisteria
lodge
chapter
the
singular
experience
of
mr
john
scott
eccles
find
it
recorded
in
my
notebook
that
it
was
bleak
and
windy
day
towards
the
end
of
march
in
the
year
1892
holmes
had
received
telegram
while
we
sat
at
our
lunch
and
he
had
scribbled
reply
he
made
no
remark
but
the
matter
remained
in
his
thoughts
for
he
stood
in
front
of
the
fire
afterwards
with
thoughtful
face
smoking
his
pipe
and
casting
an
occasional
glance
at
the
message
suddenly
he
turned
upon
me
with
mischievous
twinkle
in
his
eyes
suppose
watson
we
must
look
upon
you
as
man
of
letters
said
he
how
do
you
define
the
word
grotesque
strange
remarkable
suggested
he
shook
his
head
at
my
definition
there
is
surely
something
more
than
that
said
he
some
underlying
suggestion
of
the
tragic
and
the
terrible
if
you
cast
your
mind
back
to
some
of
those
narratives
with
which
you
have
afflicted
long
suffering
public
you
will
recognize
how
often
the
grotesque
has
deepened
into
the
criminal
think
of
that
little
affair
of
the
red
headed
men
that
was
grotesque
enough
in
the
outset
and
yet
it
ended
in
desperate
attempt
at
robbery
or
again
there
was
that
most
grotesque
affair
of
the
five
orange
pips
which
let
straight
to
murderous
conspiracy
the
word
puts
me
on
the
alert
have
you
it
there
asked
he
read
the
telegram
aloud
have
just
had
most
incredible
and
grotesque
experience
may
consult
you
scott
eccles
post
office
charing
cross
man
or
woman
asked
oh
man
of
course
no
woman
would
ever
send
reply
paid
telegram
she
would
have
come
will
you
see
him
my
dear
watson
you
know
how
bored
have
been
since
we
locked
up
colonel
carruthers
my
mind
is
like
racing
engine
tearing
itself
to
pieces
because
it
is
not
connected
up
with
the
work
for
which
it
was
built
life
is
commonplace
the
papers
are
sterile
audacity
and
romance
seem
to
have
passed
forever
from
the
criminal
world
can
you
ask
me
then
whether
am
ready
to
look
into
any
new
problem
however
trivial
it
may
prove
but
here
unless
am
mistaken
is
our
client
measured
step
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
and
moment
later
stout
tall
grey
whiskered
and
solemnly
respectable
person
was
ushered
into
the
room
his
life
history
was
written
in
his
heavy
features
and
pompous
manner
from
his
spats
to
his
gold
rimmed
spectacles
he
was
conservative
churchman
good
citizen
orthodox
and
conventional
to
the
last
degree
but
some
amazing
experience
had
disturbed
his
native
composure
and
left
its
traces
in
his
bristling
hair
his
flushed
angry
cheeks
and
his
flurried
excited
manner
he
plunged
instantly
into
his
business

have
had
most
singular
and
unpleasant
experience
mr
holmes
said
he
never
in
my
life
have
been
placed
in
such
situation
it
is
most
improper
most
outrageous
must
insist
upon
some
explanation
he
swelled
and
puffed
in
his
anger
pray
sit
down
mr
scott
eccles
said
holmes
in
soothing
voice
may
ask
in
the
first
place
why
you
came
to
me
at
all
well
sir
it
did
not
appear
to
be
matter
which
concerned
the
police
and
yet
when
you
have
heard
the
facts
you
must
admit
that
could
not
leave
it
where
it
was
private
detectives
are
class
with
whom
have
absolutely
no
sympathy
but
none
the
less
having
heard
your
name—
quite
so
but
in
the
second
place
why
did
you
not
come
at
once
holmes
glanced
at
his
watch
it
is
quarter
past
two
he
said
your
telegram
was
dispatched
about
one
but
no
one
can
glance
at
your
toilet
and
attire
without
seeing
that
your
disturbance
dates
from
the
moment
of
your
waking
our
client
smoothed
down
his
unbrushed
hair
and
felt
his
unshaven
chin
you
are
right
mr
holmes
never
gave
thought
to
my
toilet
was
only
too
glad
to
get
out
of
such
house
but
have
been
running
round
making
inquiries
before
came
to
you
went
to
the
house
agents
you
know
and
they
said
that
mr
garcia
rent
was
paid
up
all
right
and
that
everything
was
in
order
at
wisteria
lodge
come
sir
said
holmes
laughing
you
are
like
my
friend
dr
watson
who
has
bad
habit
of
telling
his
stories
wrong
end
foremost
please
arrange
your
thoughts
and
let
me
know
in
their
due
sequence
exactly
what
those
events
are
which
have
sent
you
out
unbrushed
and
unkempt
with
dress
boots
and
waistcoat
buttoned
awry
in
search
of
advice
and
assistance
our
client
looked
down
with
rueful
face
at
his
own
unconventional
appearance
sure
it
must
look
very
bad
mr
holmes
and
am
not
aware
that
in
my
whole
life
such
thing
has
ever
happened
before
but
will
tell
you
the
whole
queer
business
and
when
have
done
so
you
will
admit
am
sure
that
there
has
been
enough
to
excuse
me
but
his
narrative
was
nipped
in
the
bud
there
was
bustle
outside
and
mrs
hudson
opened
the
door
to
usher
in
two
robust
and
official
looking
individuals
one
of
whom
was
well
known
to
us
as
inspector
gregson
of
scotland
yard
an
energetic
gallant
and
within
his
limitations
capable
officer
he
shook
hands
with
holmes
and
introduced
his
comrade
as
inspector
baynes
of
the
surrey
constabulary
we
are
hunting
together
mr
holmes
and
our
trail
lay
in
this
direction
he
turned
his
bulldog
eyes
upon
our
visitor
are
you
mr
john
scott
eccles
of
popham
house
lee
am
we
have
been
following
you
about
all
the
morning
you
traced
him
through
the
telegram
no
doubt
said
holmes
exactly
mr
holmes
we
picked
up
the
scent
at
charing
cross
post
office
and
came
on
here
but
why
do
you
follow
me
what
do
you
want
we
wish
statement
mr
scott
eccles
as
to
the
events
which
let
up
to
the
death
last
night
of
mr
aloysius
garcia
of
wisteria
lodge
near
esher
our
client
had
sat
up
with
staring
eyes
and
every
tinge
of
colour
struck
from
his
astonished
face
dead
did
you
say
he
was
dead
yes
sir
he
is
dead
but
how
an
accident
murder
if
ever
there
was
one
upon
earth
good
god
this
is
awful
you
don
mean
you
don
mean
that
am
suspected
letter
of
yours
was
found
in
the
dead
man
pocket
and
we
know
by
it
that
you
had
planned
to
pass
last
night
at
his
house
so
did
oh
you
did
you
out
came
the
official
notebook
wait
bit
gregson
said
sherlock
holmes
all
you
desire
is
plain
statement
is
it
not
and
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
mr
scott
eccles
that
it
may
be
used
against
him
mr
eccles
was
going
to
tell
us
about
it
when
you
entered
the
room
think
watson
brandy
and
soda
would
do
him
no
harm
now
sir
suggest
that
you
take
no
notice
of
this
addition
to
your
audience
and
that
you
proceed
with
your
narrative
exactly
as
you
would
have
done
had
you
never
been
interrupted
our
visitor
had
gulped
off
the
brandy
and
the
colour
had
returned
to
his
face
with
dubious
glance
at
the
inspector
notebook
he
plunged
at
once
into
his
extraordinary
statement
am
bachelor
said
he
and
being
of
sociable
turn
cultivate
large
number
of
friends
among
these
are
the
family
of
retired
brewer
called
melville
living
at
abermarle
mansion
kensington
it
was
at
his
table
that
met
some
weeks
ago
young
fellow
named
garcia
he
was
understood
of
spanish
descent
and
connected
in
some
way
with
the
embassy
he
spoke
perfect
english
was
pleasing
in
his
manners
and
as
good
looking
man
as
ever
saw
in
my
life
in
some
way
we
struck
up
quite
friendship
this
young
fellow
and
he
seemed
to
take
fancy
to
me
from
the
first
and
within
two
days
of
our
meeting
he
came
to
see
me
at
lee
one
thing
led
to
another
and
it
ended
in
his
inviting
me
out
to
spend
few
days
at
his
house
wisteria
lodge
between
esher
and
oxshott
yesterday
evening
went
to
esher
to
fulfil
this
engagement
he
had
described
his
household
to
me
before
went
there
he
lived
with
faithful
servant
countryman
of
his
own
who
looked
after
all
his
needs
this
fellow
could
speak
english
and
did
his
housekeeping
for
him
then
there
was
wonderful
cook
he
said
half
breed
whom
he
had
picked
up
in
his
travels
who
could
serve
an
excellent
dinner
remember
that
he
remarked
what
queer
household
it
was
to
find
in
the
heart
of
surrey
and
that
agreed
with
him
though
it
has
proved
good
deal
queerer
than
thought
drove
to
the
place
about
two
miles
on
the
south
side
of
esher
the
house
was
fair
sized
one
standing
back
from
the
road
with
curving
drive
which
was
banked
with
high
evergreen
shrubs
it
was
an
old
tumbledown
building
in
crazy
state
of
disrepair
when
the
trap
pulled
up
on
the
grass
grown
drive
in
front
of
the
blotched
and
weather
stained
door
had
doubts
as
to
my
wisdom
in
visiting
man
whom
knew
so
slightly
he
opened
the
door
himself
however
and
greeted
me
with
great
show
of
cordiality
was
handed
over
to
the
manservant
melancholy
swarthy
individual
who
led
the
way
my
bag
in
his
hand
to
my
bedroom
the
whole
place
was
depressing
our
dinner
was
tête
and
though
my
host
did
his
best
to
be
entertaining
his
thoughts
seemed
to
continually
wander
and
he
talked
so
vaguely
and
wildly
that
could
hardly
understand
him
he
continually
drummed
his
fingers
on
the
table
gnawed
his
nails
and
gave
other
signs
of
nervous
impatience
the
dinner
itself
was
neither
well
served
nor
well
cooked
and
the
gloomy
presence
of
the
taciturn
servant
did
not
help
to
enliven
us
can
assure
you
that
many
times
in
the
course
of
the
evening
wished
that
could
invent
some
excuse
which
would
take
me
back
to
lee
one
thing
comes
back
to
my
memory
which
may
have
bearing
upon
the
business
that
you
two
gentlemen
are
investigating
thought
nothing
of
it
at
the
time
near
the
end
of
dinner
note
was
handed
in
by
the
servant
noticed
that
after
my
host
had
read
it
he
seemed
even
more
distrait
and
strange
than
before
he
gave
up
all
pretence
at
conversation
and
sat
smoking
endless
cigarettes
lost
in
his
own
thoughts
but
he
made
no
remark
as
to
the
contents
about
eleven
was
glad
to
go
to
bed
some
time
later
garcia
looked
in
at
my
door
the
room
was
dark
at
the
time
and
asked
me
if
had
rung
said
that
had
not
he
apologized
for
having
disturbed
me
so
late
saying
that
it
was
nearly
one
clock
dropped
off
after
this
and
slept
soundly
all
night
and
now
come
to
the
amazing
part
of
my
tale
when
woke
it
was
broad
daylight
glanced
at
my
watch
and
the
time
was
nearly
nine
had
particularly
asked
to
be
called
at
eight
so
was
very
much
astonished
at
this
forgetfulness
sprang
up
and
rang
for
the
servant
there
was
no
response
rang
again
and
again
with
the
same
result
then
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
bell
was
out
of
order
huddled
on
my
clothes
and
hurried
downstairs
in
an
exceedingly
bad
temper
to
order
some
hot
water
you
can
imagine
my
surprise
when
found
that
there
was
no
one
there
shouted
in
the
hall
there
was
no
answer
then
ran
from
room
to
room
all
were
deserted
my
host
had
shown
me
which
was
his
bedroom
the
night
before
so
knocked
at
the
door
no
reply
turned
the
handle
and
walked
in
the
room
was
empty
and
the
bed
had
never
been
slept
in
he
had
gone
with
the
rest
the
foreign
host
the
foreign
footman
the
foreign
cook
all
had
vanished
in
the
night
that
was
the
end
of
my
visit
to
wisteria
lodge
sherlock
holmes
was
rubbing
his
hands
and
chuckling
as
he
added
this
bizarre
incident
to
his
collection
of
strange
episodes
your
experience
is
so
far
as
know
perfectly
unique
said
he
may
ask
sir
what
you
did
then

was
furious
my
first
idea
was
that
had
been
the
victim
of
some
absurd
practical
joke
packed
my
things
banged
the
hall
door
behind
me
and
set
off
for
esher
with
my
bag
in
my
hand
called
at
allan
brothers
the
chief
land
agents
in
the
village
and
found
that
it
was
from
this
firm
that
the
villa
had
been
rented
it
struck
me
that
the
whole
proceeding
could
hardly
be
for
the
purpose
of
making
fool
of
me
and
that
the
main
objet
must
be
to
get
out
of
the
rent
it
is
late
in
march
so
quarterday
is
at
hand
but
this
theory
would
not
work
the
agent
was
obliged
to
me
for
my
warning
but
told
me
that
the
rent
had
been
paid
in
advance
then
made
my
way
to
town
and
called
at
the
spanish
embassy
the
man
was
unknown
there
after
this
went
to
see
melville
at
whose
house
had
first
met
garcia
but
found
that
he
really
knew
rather
less
about
him
than
did
finally
when
got
your
reply
to
my
wire
came
out
to
you
since
gather
that
you
are
person
who
gives
advice
in
difficult
cases
but
now
mr
inspector
understand
from
what
you
said
when
you
entered
the
room
that
you
can
carry
the
story
on
and
that
some
tragedy
had
occurred
can
assure
you
that
every
word
have
said
is
the
truth
and
that
outside
of
what
have
told
you
know
absolutely
nothing
about
the
fate
of
this
man
my
only
desire
is
to
help
the
law
in
every
possible
way
am
sure
of
it
mr
scott
eccles
am
sure
of
it
said
inspector
gregson
in
very
amiable
tone
am
bound
to
say
that
everything
which
you
have
said
agrees
very
closely
with
the
facts
as
they
have
come
to
our
notice
for
example
there
was
that
note
which
arrived
during
dinner
did
you
chance
to
observe
what
became
of
it
yes
did
garcia
rolled
it
up
and
threw
it
into
the
fire
what
do
you
say
to
that
mr
baynes
the
country
detective
was
stout
puffy
red
man
whose
face
was
only
redeemed
from
grossness
by
two
extraordinarily
bright
eyes
almost
hidden
behind
the
heavy
creases
of
cheek
and
brow
with
slow
smile
he
drew
folded
and
discoloured
scrap
of
paper
from
his
pocket
it
was
dog
grate
mr
holmes
and
he
overpitched
it
picked
this
out
unburned
from
the
back
of
it
holmes
smiled
his
appreciation
you
must
have
examined
the
house
very
carefully
to
find
single
pellet
of
paper
did
mr
holmes
it
my
way
shall
read
it
mr
gregson
the
londoner
nodded
the
note
is
written
upon
ordinary
cream
laid
paper
without
watermark
it
is
quarter
sheet
the
paper
is
cut
off
in
two
snips
with
short
bladed
scissors
it
has
been
folded
over
three
times
and
sealed
with
purple
wax
put
on
hurriedly
and
pressed
down
with
some
flat
oval
object
it
is
addressed
to
mr
garcia
wisteria
lodge
it
says
our
own
colours
green
and
white
green
open
white
shut
main
stair
first
corridor
seventh
right
green
baize
godspeed
it
is
woman
writing
done
with
sharp
pointed
pen
but
the
address
is
either
done
with
another
pen
or
by
someone
else
it
is
thicker
and
bolder
as
you
see
very
remarkable
note
said
holmes
glancing
it
over
must
compliment
you
mr
baynes
upon
your
attention
to
detail
in
your
examination
of
it
few
trifling
points
might
perhaps
be
added
the
oval
seal
is
undoubtedly
plain
sleeve
link
what
else
is
of
such
shape
the
scissors
were
bent
nail
scissors
short
as
the
two
snips
are
you
can
distinctly
see
the
same
slight
curve
in
each
the
country
detective
chuckled
thought
had
squeezed
all
the
juice
out
of
it
but
see
there
was
little
over
he
said
bound
to
say
that
make
nothing
of
the
note
except
that
there
was
something
on
hand
and
that
woman
as
usual
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
mr
scott
eccles
had
fidgeted
in
his
seat
during
this
conversation
am
glad
you
found
the
note
since
it
corroborates
my
story
said
he
but
beg
to
point
out
that
have
not
yet
heard
what
has
happened
to
mr
garcia
nor
what
has
become
of
his
household
as
to
garcia
said
gregson
that
is
easily
answered
he
was
found
dead
this
morning
upon
oxshott
common
nearly
mile
from
his
home
his
head
had
been
smashed
to
pulp
by
heavy
blows
of
sandbag
or
some
such
instrument
which
had
crushed
rather
than
wounded
it
is
lonely
corner
and
there
is
no
house
within
quarter
of
mile
of
the
spot
he
had
apparently
been
struck
down
first
from
behind
but
his
assailant
had
gone
on
beating
him
long
after
he
was
dead
it
was
most
furious
assault
there
are
no
footsteps
nor
any
clue
to
the
criminals
robbed
no
there
was
no
attempt
at
robbery
this
is
very
painful
very
painful
and
terrible
said
mr
scott
eccles
in
querulous
voice
but
it
is
really
uncommonly
hard
on
me
had
nothing
to
do
with
my
host
going
off
upon
nocturnal
excursion
and
meeting
so
sad
an
end
how
do
come
to
be
mixed
up
with
the
case
very
simply
sir
inspector
baynes
answered
the
only
document
found
in
the
pocket
of
the
deceased
was
letter
from
you
saying
that
you
would
be
with
him
on
the
night
of
his
death
it
was
the
envelope
of
this
letter
which
gave
us
the
dead
man
name
and
address
it
was
after
nine
this
morning
when
we
reached
his
house
and
found
neither
you
nor
anyone
else
inside
it
wired
to
mr
gregson
to
run
you
down
in
london
while
examined
wisteria
lodge
then
came
into
town
joined
mr
gregson
and
here
we
are
think
now
said
gregson
rising
we
had
best
put
this
matter
into
an
official
shape
you
will
come
round
with
us
to
the
station
mr
scott
eccles
and
let
us
have
your
statement
in
writing
certainly
will
come
at
once
but
retain
your
services
mr
holmes
desire
you
to
spare
no
expense
and
no
pains
to
get
at
the
truth
my
friend
turned
to
the
country
inspector
suppose
that
you
have
no
objection
to
my
collaborating
with
you
mr
baynes
highly
honoured
sir
am
sure
you
appear
to
have
been
very
prompt
and
businesslike
in
all
that
you
have
done
was
there
any
clue
may
ask
as
to
the
exact
hour
that
the
man
met
his
death
he
had
been
there
since
one
clock
there
was
rain
about
that
time
and
his
death
had
certainly
been
before
the
rain
but
that
is
perfectly
impossible
mr
baynes
cried
our
client
his
voice
is
unmistakable
could
swear
to
it
that
it
was
he
who
addressed
me
in
my
bedroom
at
that
very
hour
remarkable
but
by
no
means
impossible
said
holmes
smiling
you
have
clue
asked
gregson
on
the
face
of
it
the
case
is
not
very
complex
one
though
it
certainly
presents
some
novel
and
interesting
features
further
knowledge
of
facts
is
necessary
before
would
venture
to
give
final
and
definite
opinion
by
the
way
mr
baynes
did
you
find
anything
remarkable
besides
this
note
in
your
examination
of
the
house
the
detective
looked
at
my
friend
in
singular
way
there
were
said
he
one
or
two
very
remarkable
things
perhaps
when
have
finished
at
the
police
station
you
would
care
to
come
out
and
give
me
your
opinion
of
them
in
am
entirely
at
your
service
said
sherlock
holmes
ringing
the
bell
you
will
show
these
gentlemen
out
mrs
hudson
and
kindly
send
the
boy
with
this
telegram
he
is
to
pay
fiveshilling
reply
we
sat
for
some
time
in
silence
after
our
visitors
had
left
holmes
smoked
hard
with
his
browns
drawn
down
over
his
keen
eyes
and
his
head
thrust
forward
in
the
eager
way
characteristic
of
the
man
well
watson
he
asked
turning
suddenly
upon
me
what
do
you
make
of
it
can
make
nothing
of
this
mystification
of
scott
eccles
but
the
crime
well
taken
with
the
disappearance
of
the
man
companions
should
say
that
they
were
in
some
way
concerned
in
the
murder
and
had
fled
from
justice
that
is
certainly
possible
point
of
view
on
the
face
of
it
you
must
admit
however
that
it
is
very
strange
that
his
two
servants
should
have
been
in
conspiracy
against
him
and
should
have
attacked
him
on
the
one
night
when
he
had
guest
they
had
him
alone
at
their
mercy
every
other
night
in
the
week
then
why
did
they
fly
quite
so
why
did
they
fly
there
is
big
fact
another
big
fact
is
the
remarkable
experience
of
our
client
scott
eccles
now
my
dear
watson
is
it
beyond
the
limits
of
human
ingenuity
to
furnish
an
explanation
which
would
cover
both
of
these
big
facts
if
it
were
one
which
would
also
admit
of
the
mysterious
note
with
its
very
curious
phraseology
why
then
it
would
be
worth
accepting
as
temporary
hypothesis
if
the
fresh
facts
which
come
to
our
knowledge
all
fit
themselves
into
the
scheme
then
our
hypothesis
may
gradually
become
solution
but
what
is
our
hypothesis
holmes
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
half
closed
eyes
you
must
admit
my
dear
watson
that
the
idea
of
joke
is
impossible
there
were
grave
events
afoot
as
the
sequel
showed
and
the
coaxing
of
scott
eccles
to
wisteria
lodge
had
some
connection
with
them

but
what
possible
connection
let
us
take
it
link
by
link
there
is
on
the
face
of
it
something
unnatural
about
this
strange
and
sudden
friendship
between
the
young
spaniard
and
scott
eccles
it
was
the
former
who
forced
the
pace
he
called
upon
eccles
at
the
other
end
of
london
on
the
very
day
after
he
first
met
him
and
he
kept
in
close
touch
with
him
until
he
got
him
down
to
esher
now
what
did
he
want
with
eccles
what
could
eccles
supply
see
no
charm
in
the
man
he
is
not
particulary
intelligent
not
man
likely
to
be
congenial
to
quick
witted
latin
why
then
was
he
picked
out
from
all
the
other
people
whom
garcia
met
as
particularly
suited
to
his
purpose
has
he
any
one
outstanding
quality
say
that
he
has
he
is
the
very
type
of
conventional
british
respectability
and
the
very
man
as
witness
to
impress
another
briton
you
saw
yourself
how
neither
of
the
inspectors
dreamed
of
questioning
his
statement
extraordinary
as
it
was
but
what
was
he
to
witness
nothing
as
things
turned
out
but
everything
had
they
gone
another
way
that
is
how
read
the
matter
see
he
might
have
proved
an
alibi
exactly
my
dear
watson
he
might
have
proved
an
alibi
we
will
suppose
for
argument
sake
that
the
household
of
wisteria
lodge
are
confederates
in
some
design
the
attempt
whatever
it
may
be
is
to
come
off
we
will
say
before
one
clock
by
some
juggling
of
the
clocks
it
is
quite
possible
that
they
may
have
got
scott
eccles
to
bed
earlier
than
he
thought
but
in
any
case
it
is
likely
that
when
garcia
went
out
of
his
way
to
tell
him
that
it
was
one
it
was
really
not
more
than
twelve
if
garcia
could
do
whatever
he
had
to
do
and
be
back
by
the
hour
mentioned
he
had
evidently
powerful
reply
to
any
accusation
here
was
this
irreproachable
englishman
ready
to
swear
in
any
court
of
law
that
the
accused
was
in
the
house
all
the
time
it
was
an
insurance
against
the
worst
yes
see
that
but
how
about
the
disappearance
of
the
others
have
not
all
my
facts
yet
but
do
not
think
there
are
any
insuperable
difficulties
still
it
is
an
error
to
argue
in
front
of
your
data
you
find
yourself
insensibly
twisting
them
round
to
fit
your
theories
and
the
message
how
did
it
run
our
own
colours
green
and
white
sounds
like
racing
green
open
white
shut
that
is
clearly
signal
main
stair
first
corridor
seventh
right
green
baize
this
is
an
assignation
we
may
find
jealous
husband
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
it
was
clearly
dangerous
quest
she
would
not
have
said
godspeed
had
it
not
been
so
—that
should
be
guide
the
man
was
spaniard
suggest
that
stands
for
dolores
common
female
name
in
spain
good
watson
very
good
but
quite
inadmissable
spaniard
would
write
to
spaniard
in
spanish
the
writer
of
this
note
is
certainly
english
well
we
can
only
possess
our
soul
in
patience
until
this
excellent
inspector
come
back
for
us
meanwhile
we
can
thank
our
lucky
fate
which
has
rescued
us
for
few
short
hours
from
the
insufferable
fatigues
of
idleness
an
answer
had
arrived
to
holmes
telegram
before
our
surrey
officer
had
returned
holmes
read
it
and
was
about
to
place
it
in
his
notebook
when
he
caught
glimpse
of
my
expectant
face
he
tossed
it
across
with
laugh
we
are
moving
in
exalted
circles
said
he
the
telegram
was
list
of
names
and
addresses
lord
harringby
the
dingle
sir
george
ffolliott
oxshott

mr
hynes
purdley
place
mr
james
baker
williams
forton
old

mr
henderson
high
gable
rev
joshua
stone
nether
walsling
this
is
very
obvious
way
of
limiting
our
field
of
operations
said
holmes
no
doubt
baynes
with
his
methodical
mind
has
already
adopted
some
similar
plan
don
quite
understand
well
my
dear
fellow
we
have
already
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
the
massage
received
by
garcia
at
dinner
was
an
appointment
or
an
assignation
now
if
the
obvious
reading
of
it
is
correct
and
in
order
to
keep
the
tryst
one
has
to
ascend
main
stair
and
seek
the
seventh
door
in
corridor
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
house
is
very
large
one
it
is
equally
certain
that
this
house
cannot
be
more
than
mile
or
two
from
oxshott
since
garcia
was
walking
in
that
direction
and
hoped
according
to
my
reading
of
the
facts
to
be
back
in
wisteria
lodge
in
time
to
avail
himself
of
an
alibi
which
would
only
be
valid
up
to
one
clock
as
the
number
of
large
houses
close
to
oxshott
must
be
limited
adopted
the
obvious
method
of
sending
to
the
agents
mentioned
by
scott
eccles
and
obtaining
list
of
them
here
they
are
in
this
telegram
and
the
other
end
of
our
tangled
skein
must
lie
among
them
it
was
nearly
six
clock
before
we
found
ourselves
in
the
pretty
surrey
village
of
esher
with
inspector
baynes
as
our
companion
holmes
and
had
taken
things
for
the
night
and
found
comfortable
quarters
at
the
bull
finally
we
set
out
in
the
company
of
the
detective
on
our
visit
to
wisteria
lodge
it
was
cold
dark
march
evening
with
sharp
wind
and
fine
rain
beating
upon
our
faces
fit
setting
for
the
wild
common
over
which
our
road
passed
and
the
tragic
goal
to
which
it
led
us
chapter
ii
the
tiger
of
san
pedro
cold
and
melancholy
walk
of
couple
of
miles
brought
us
to
high
wooden
gate
which
opened
into
gloomy
avenue
of
chestnuts
the
curved
and
shadowed
drive
led
us
to
low
dark
house
pitchblack
against
slate
coloured
sky
from
the
front
window
upon
the
left
of
the
door
there
peeped
glimmer
of
feeble
light
there
constable
in
possession
said
baynes
ll
knock
at
the
window
he
stepped
across
the
grass
plot
and
tapped
with
his
hand
on
the
pane
through
the
fogged
glass
dimly
saw
man
spring
up
from
chair
beside
the
fire
and
heard
sharp
cry
from
within
the
room
an
instant
later
white
faced
hardbreathing
policeman
had
opened
the
door
the
candle
wavering
in
his
trembling
hand
what
the
matter
walters
asked
baynes
sharply
the
man
mopped
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
and
agave
long
sigh
of
relief
am
glad
you
have
come
sir
it
has
been
long
evening
and
don
think
my
nerve
is
as
good
as
it
was
your
nerve
walters
should
not
have
thought
you
had
nerve
in
your
body
well
sir
it
this
lonely
silent
house
and
the
queer
thing
in
the
kitchen
then
when
you
tapped
at
the
window
thought
it
had
come
again
that
what
had
come
again
the
devil
sir
for
all
know
it
was
at
the
window
what
was
at
the
window
and
when
it
was
just
about
two
hours
ago
the
light
was
just
fading
was
sitting
reading
in
the
chair
don
know
what
made
me
look
up
but
there
was
face
looking
in
at
me
through
the
lower
pane
lord
sir
what
face
it
was
ll
see
it
in
my
dreams
tut
walters
this
is
not
talk
for
police
constable
know
sir
know
but
it
shook
me
sir
and
there
no
use
to
deny
it
wasn
black
sir
nor
was
it
white
nor
any
colour
that
know
but
kind
of
queer
shade
like
clay
with
splash
of
milk
in
it
then
there
was
the
size
of
it
was
twice
yours
sir
and
the
look
of
it
the
great
staring
goggle
eyes
and
the
line
of
white
teeth
like
hungry
beast
tell
you
sir
couldn
move
finger
nor
get
my
breath
till
it
whisked
away
and
was
gone
out
ran
and
through
the
shrubbery
but
thank
god
there
was
no
one
there
if
didn
know
you
were
good
man
walters
should
put
black
mark
against
you
for
this
if
it
were
the
devil
himself
constable
on
duty
should
never
thank
god
that
he
could
not
lay
his
hands
upon
him
suppose
the
whole
thing
is
not
vision
and
touch
of
nerves
that
at
least
is
very
easily
settled
said
holmes
lighting
his
little
pocket
lantern
yes
he
reported
after
short
examination
of
the
grass
bed
number
twelve
shoe
should
say
if
he
was
all
on
the
same
scale
as
his
foot
he
must
certainly
have
been
giant
what
became
of
him
he
seems
to
have
broken
through
the
shrubbery
and
made
for
the
road
well
said
the
inspector
with
grave
and
thoughtful
face
whoever
he
may
have
been
and
whatever
he
may
have
wanted
he
gone
for
the
present
and
we
have
more
immediate
things
to
attend
to
now
mr
holmes
with
your
permission
will
show
you
round
the
house
the
various
bedrooms
and
sitting
rooms
had
yielded
nothing
to
careful
search
apparently
the
tenants
had
brought
little
or
nothing
with
them
and
all
the
furniture
down
to
the
smallest
details
had
been
taken
over
with
the
house
good
deal
of
clothing
with
the
stamp
of
marx
and
co
high
holborn
had
been
left
behind
telegraphic
inquiries
had
been
already
made
which
showed
that
marx
knew
nothing
of
his
customer
save
that
he
was
good
payer
odds
and
ends
some
pipes
few
novels
two
of
them
in
spanish
and
old
fashioned
pinfire
revolver
and
guitar
were
among
the
personal
property

nothing
in
all
this
said
baynes
stalking
candle
in
hand
from
room
to
room
but
now
mr
holmes
invite
your
attention
to
the
kitchen
it
was
gloomy
high
ceilinged
room
at
the
back
of
the
house
with
straw
litter
in
one
corner
which
served
apparently
as
bed
for
the
cook
the
table
was
piled
with
half
eaten
dishes
and
dirty
plates
the
debris
of
last
night
dinner
look
at
this
said
baynes
what
do
you
make
of
it
he
held
up
his
candle
before
an
extraordinary
object
which
stood
at
the
back
of
the
dresser
it
was
so
wrinkled
and
shrunken
and
withered
that
it
was
difficult
to
say
what
it
might
have
been
one
could
but
say
that
it
was
black
and
leathery
and
that
it
bore
some
resemblance
to
dwarfish
human
figure
at
first
as
examined
it
thought
that
it
was
mummified
negro
baby
and
then
it
seemed
very
twisted
and
ancient
monkey
finally
was
left
in
doubt
as
to
whether
it
was
animal
or
human
double
band
of
white
shells
were
strung
round
the
centre
of
it
very
interesting
very
interesting
indeed
said
holmes
peering
at
this
sinister
relic
anything
more
in
silence
baynes
led
the
way
to
the
sink
and
held
forward
his
candle
the
limbs
and
body
of
some
large
white
bird
torn
savagely
to
pieces
with
the
feathers
still
on
were
littered
all
over
it
holmes
pointed
to
the
wattles
on
the
severed
head
white
cock
said
he
most
interesting
it
is
really
very
curious
case
but
mr
baynes
had
kept
his
most
sinister
exhibit
to
the
last
›From
under
the
sink
he
drew
zinc
pail
which
contained
quantity
of
blood
then
from
the
table
he
took
platter
heaped
with
small
pieces
of
charred
bone
something
has
been
killed
and
something
has
been
burned
we
raked
all
these
out
of
the
fire
we
had
doctor
in
this
morning
he
says
that
they
are
not
human
holmes
smiled
and
rubbed
his
hands
must
congratulate
you
inspector
on
handling
so
distinctive
and
instructive
case
your
powers
if
may
say
so
without
offence
seem
superior
to
your
opportunities
inspector
baynes
small
eyes
twinkled
with
pleasure
you
re
right
mr
holmes
we
stagnate
in
the
provinces
case
of
this
sort
gives
man
chance
and
hope
that
shall
take
it
what
do
you
make
of
these
bones
lamb
should
say
or
kid
and
the
white
cock
curious
mr
baynes
very
curious
should
say
almost
unique
yes
sir
there
must
have
been
some
very
strange
people
with
some
very
strange
ways
in
this
house
one
of
them
is
dead
did
his
companions
follow
him
and
kill
him
if
they
did
we
should
have
them
for
every
port
is
watched
but
my
own
views
are
different
yes
sir
my
own
views
are
very
different
you
have
theory
then
and
ll
work
it
myself
mr
holmes
it
only
due
to
my
own
credit
to
do
so
your
name
is
made
but
have
still
to
make
mine
should
be
glad
to
be
able
to
say
afterwards
that
had
solved
it
without
your
help
holmes
laughed
good
humoredly
well
inspector
said
he
do
you
follow
your
path
and
will
follow
mine
my
results
are
always
very
much
at
your
service
if
you
care
to
apply
to
me
for
them
think
that
have
seen
all
that
wish
in
this
house
and
that
my
time
may
be
more
profitably
employed
elsewhere
au
revoir
and
good
luck
could
tell
by
numerous
subtle
signs
which
might
have
been
lost
upon
anyone
but
myself
that
holmes
was
on
hot
scent
as
impassive
as
ever
to
the
casual
observer
there
were
none
the
less
subdued
eagerness
and
suggestion
of
tension
in
his
brightened
eyes
and
brisker
manner
which
assured
me
that
the
game
was
afoot
after
his
habit
he
said
nothing
and
after
mine
asked
no
questions
sufficient
for
me
to
share
the
sport
and
lend
my
humble
help
to
the
capture
without
distracting
that
intent
brain
with
needless
interruption
all
would
come
round
to
me
in
due
time
waited
therefore
but
to
my
ever
deepening
disappointment
waited
in
vain
day
succeeded
day
and
my
friend
took
no
step
forward
one
morning
he
spent
in
town
and
learned
from
casual
reference
that
he
had
visited
the
british
museum
save
for
this
one
excursion
he
spent
his
days
in
long
and
often
solitary
walks
or
in
chatting
with
number
of
village
gossips
whose
acquaintance
he
had
cultivated
sure
watson
week
in
the
country
will
be
invaluable
to
you
he
remarked
it
is
very
pleasant
to
see
the
first
green
shoots
upon
the
hedges
and
the
catkins
on
the
hazels
once
again
with
spud
tin
box
and
an
elementary
book
on
botany
there
are
instructive
days
to
be
spent
he
prowled
about
with
this
equipment
himself
but
it
was
poor
show
of
plants
which
he
would
bring
back
of
an
evening
occasionally
in
our
rambles
we
came
across
inspector
baynes
his
fat
red
face
wreathed
itself
in
smiles
and
his
small
eyes
glittered
as
he
greeted
my
companion
he
said
little
about
the
case
but
from
that
little
we
gathered
that
he
also
was
not
dissatisfied
at
the
course
of
events
must
admit
however
that
was
somewhat
surprised
when
some
five
days
after
the
crime
opened
my
morning
paper
to
find
in
large
letters
the
oxshott
mystery
solution
arrest
of
supposed
assassin
holmes
sprang
in
his
chair
as
if
he
had
been
stung
when
read
the
headlines
by
jove
he
cried
you
don
mean
that
baynes
has
got
him
apparently
said
as
read
the
following
report
great
excitement
was
caused
in
esher
and
the
neighbouring
district
when
it
was
learned
late
last
night
that
an
arrest
had
been
effected
in
connection
with
the
oxshott
murder
it
will
be
remembered
that
mr
garcia
of
wisteria
lodge
was
found
dead
on
oxshott
common
his
body
showing
signs
of
extreme
violence
and
that
on
the
same
night
his
servant
and
his
cook
fled
which
appeared
to
show
their
participation
in
the
crime
it
was
suggested
but
never
proved
that
the
deceased
gentleman
may
have
had
valuables
in
the
house
and
that
their
abstraction
was
the
motive
of
the
crime
every
effort
was
made
by
inspector
baynes
who
has
the
case
in
hand
to
ascertain
the
hiding
place
of
the
fugitives
and
he
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
they
had
not
gone
far
but
were
lurking
in
some
retreat
which
had
been
already
prepared
it
was
certain
from
the
first
however
that
they
would
eventually
be
detected
as
the
cook
from
the
evidence
of
one
or
two
tradespeople
who
have
caught
glimpse
of
him
through
the
window
was
man
of
most
remarkable
appearance
being
huge
and
hideous
mulatto
with
yellowish
features
of
pronounced
negroid
type
this
man
has
been
seen
since
the
crime
for
he
was
detected
and
pursued
by
constable
walters
on
the
same
evening
when
he
had
the
audacity
to
revisit
wisteria
lodge
inspector
baynes
considering
that
such
visit
must
have
some
purpose
in
view
and
was
likely
therefore
to
be
repeated
abandoned
the
house
but
left
an
ambuscade
in
the
shrubbery
the
man
walked
into
the
trap
and
was
captured
last
night
after
struggle
in
which
constable
downing
was
badly
bitten
by
the
savage
we
understand
that
when
the
prison
is
brought
before
the
magistrates
remand
will
be
applied
for
by
the
police
and
that
great
developments
are
hoped
from
his
capture
really
we
must
see
baynes
at
once
cried
holmes
picking
up
his
hat
we
will
just
catch
him
before
he
starts
we
hurried
down
the
village
street
and
found
as
we
had
expected
that
the
inspector
was
just
leaving
his
lodgings
you
ve
seen
the
paper
mr
holmes
he
asked
holding
one
out
to
us
yes
baynes
ve
seen
it
pray
don
think
it
liberty
if
give
you
word
of
friendly
warning
of
warning
mr
holmes
have
looked
into
this
case
with
some
care
and
am
not
convinced
that
you
are
on
the
right
lines
don
want
you
to
commit
yourself
too
far
unless
you
are
sure
you
re
very
kind
mr
holmes
assure
you
speak
for
your
good
it
seemed
to
me
that
something
like
wink
quivered
for
an
instant
over
one
of
mr
baynes
tiny
eyes
we
agreed
to
work
on
our
own
lines
mr
holmes
that
what
am
doing
oh
very
good
said
holmes
don
blame
me
no
sir
believe
you
mean
well
by
me
but
we
all
have
our
own
systems
mr
holmes
you
have
yours
and
maybe
have
mine
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
you
re
welcome
always
to
my
news
this
fellow
is
perfect
savage
as
strong
as
cart
horse
and
as
fierce
as
the
devil
he
chewed
downing
thumb
nearly
off
before
they
could
master
him
he
hardly
speaks
word
of
english
and
we
can
get
nothing
out
of
him
but
grunts
and
you
think
you
have
evidence
that
he
murdered
his
late
master
didn
say
so
mr
holmes
didn
say
so
we
all
have
our
little
ways
you
try
yours
and
will
try
mine
that
the
agreement
holmes
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
we
walked
away
together
can
make
the
man
out
he
seems
to
be
riding
for
fall
well
as
he
says
we
must
each
try
our
own
way
and
see
what
comes
of
it
but
there
something
in
inspector
baynes
which
can
quite
understand

just
sit
down
in
that
chair
watson
said
sherlock
holmes
when
we
had
returned
to
our
apartment
at
the
bull
want
to
put
you
in
touch
with
the
situation
as
may
need
your
help
to
night
let
me
show
you
the
evolution
of
this
case
so
far
as
have
been
able
to
follow
it
simple
as
it
has
been
in
its
leading
features
it
has
none
the
less
presented
surprising
difficulties
in
the
way
of
an
arrest
there
are
gaps
in
that
direction
which
we
have
still
to
fill
we
will
go
back
to
the
note
which
was
handed
in
to
garcia
upon
the
evening
of
his
death
we
may
put
aside
this
idea
of
baynes
that
garcia
servants
were
concerned
in
the
matter
the
proof
of
this
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
was
he
who
had
arranged
for
the
presence
of
scott
eccles
which
could
only
have
been
done
for
the
purpose
of
an
alibi
it
was
garcia
then
who
had
an
enterprise
and
apparently
criminal
enterprise
in
hand
that
night
in
the
course
of
which
he
met
his
death
say
criminal
because
only
man
with
criminal
enterprise
desires
to
establish
an
alibi
who
then
is
most
likely
to
have
taken
his
life
surely
the
person
against
whom
the
criminal
enterprise
was
directed
so
far
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
on
safe
ground
we
can
now
see
reason
for
the
disappearance
of
garcia
household
they
were
all
confederates
in
the
same
unknown
crime
if
it
came
off
when
garcia
returned
any
possible
suspicion
would
be
warded
off
by
the
englishman
evidence
and
all
would
be
well
but
the
attempt
was
dangerous
one
and
if
garcia
did
not
return
by
certain
hour
it
was
probable
that
his
own
life
had
been
sacrificed
it
had
been
arranged
therefore
that
in
such
case
his
two
subordinates
were
to
make
for
some
prearranged
spot
where
they
could
escape
investigation
and
be
in
position
afterwards
to
renew
their
attempt
that
would
fully
explain
the
facts
would
it
not
the
whole
inexplicable
tangle
seemed
to
straighten
out
before
me
wondered
as
always
did
how
it
had
not
been
obvious
to
me
before
but
why
should
one
servant
return
we
can
imagine
that
in
the
confusion
of
flight
something
precious
something
which
he
could
not
bear
to
part
with
had
been
left
behind
that
would
explain
his
persistence
would
it
not
well
what
is
the
next
step
the
next
step
is
the
note
received
by
garcia
at
the
dinner
it
indicates
confederate
at
the
other
end
now
where
was
the
other
end
have
already
shown
you
that
it
could
only
lie
in
some
large
house
and
that
the
number
of
large
houses
is
limited
my
first
days
in
this
village
were
devoted
to
series
of
walks
in
which
in
the
intervals
of
my
botanical
researches
made
reconnaissance
of
all
the
large
houses
and
an
examination
of
the
family
history
of
the
occupants
one
house
and
only
one
riveted
my
attention
it
is
the
famous
old
jacobean
grange
of
high
gable
one
mile
on
the
farther
side
of
oxshott
and
less
than
half
mile
from
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
the
other
mansions
belonged
to
prosaic
and
respectable
people
who
live
far
aloof
from
romance
but
mr
henderson
of
high
gable
was
by
all
accounts
curious
man
to
whom
curious
adventures
might
befall
concentrated
my
attention
therefore
upon
him
and
his
household
singular
set
of
people
watson
the
man
himself
the
most
singular
of
them
all
managed
to
see
him
on
plausible
pretext
but
seemed
to
read
in
his
dark
deepset
brooding
eyes
that
he
was
perfectly
aware
of
my
true
business
he
is
man
of
fifty
strong
active
with
iron
grey
hair
great
bunched
black
eyebrows
the
step
of
deer
and
the
air
of
an
emperor
fierce
masterful
man
with
red
hot
spirit
behind
his
parchment
face
he
is
either
foreigner
or
has
lived
long
in
the
tropics
for
he
is
yellow
and
sapless
but
tough
as
whipcord
his
friend
and
secretary
mr
lucas
is
undoubtedly
foreigner
chocolate
brown
wily
suave
and
catlike
with
poisonous
gentleness
of
speech
you
see
watson
we
have
come
already
upon
two
sets
of
foreigners
one
at
wisteria
lodge
and
one
at
high
gable
so
our
gaps
are
beginning
to
close
these
two
men
close
and
confidential
friends
are
the
centre
of
the
household
but
there
is
one
other
person
who
for
our
immediate
purpose
may
be
even
more
important
henderson
has
two
children
girls
of
eleven
and
thirteen
their
governess
is
miss
burnet
an
englishwoman
of
forty
or
thereabouts
there
is
also
one
confidential
manservant
this
little
group
forms
the
real
family
for
their
travel
about
together
and
henderson
is
great
traveller
always
on
the
move
it
is
only
within
the
last
weeks
that
he
has
returned
after
year
absence
to
high
gable
may
add
that
he
is
enormously
rich
and
whatever
his
whims
may
be
he
can
very
easily
satisfy
them
for
the
rest
his
house
is
full
of
butlers
footmen
maidservants
and
the
usual
overfed
underworked
staff
of
large
english
country
house
so
much
learned
partly
from
village
gossip
and
partly
from
my
own
observation
there
are
no
better
instruments
than
discharged
servants
with
grievance
and
was
lucky
enough
to
find
one
call
it
luck
but
it
would
not
have
come
my
way
had
not
been
looking
out
for
it
as
baynes
remarks
we
all
have
our
systems
it
was
my
system
which
enabled
me
to
find
john
warner
late
gardener
of
high
gable
sacked
in
moment
of
temper
by
his
imperious
employer
he
in
turn
had
friends
among
the
indoor
servants
who
unite
in
their
fear
and
dislike
of
their
master
so
had
my
key
to
the
secrets
of
the
establishment
curious
people
watson
don
pretend
to
understand
it
all
yet
but
very
curious
people
anyway
it
double
winged
house
and
the
servants
live
on
one
side
the
family
on
the
other
there
no
link
between
the
two
save
for
henderson
own
servant
who
serves
the
family
meals
everything
is
carried
to
certain
door
which
forms
the
one
connection
governess
and
children
hardly
go
out
at
all
except
into
the
garden
henderson
never
by
any
chance
walks
alone
his
dark
secretary
is
like
his
shadow
the
gossip
among
the
servants
is
that
their
master
is
terribly
afraid
of
something
sold
his
soul
to
the
devil
in
exchange
for
money
says
warner
and
expects
his
creditor
to
come
up
and
claim
his
own
where
they
came
from
or
who
they
are
nobody
has
an
idea
they
are
very
violent
twice
henderson
has
lashed
at
folk
with
his
dog
whip
and
only
his
long
purse
and
heavy
compensation
have
kept
him
out
of
the
courts
well
now
watson
let
us
judge
the
situation
by
this
new
information
we
may
take
it
that
the
letter
came
out
of
this
strange
household
and
was
an
invitation
to
garcia
to
carry
out
some
attempt
which
had
already
been
planned
who
wrote
the
note
it
was
someone
within
the
citadel
and
it
was
woman
who
then
but
miss
burnet
the
governess
all
our
reasoning
seems
to
point
that
way
at
any
rate
we
may
take
it
asa
hypothesis
and
see
what
consequences
it
would
entail
may
add
that
miss
burnet
age
and
character
make
it
certain
that
my
first
idea
that
there
might
be
love
interest
in
our
story
is
out
of
the
question
if
she
wrote
the
note
she
was
presumably
the
friend
and
confederate
of
garcia
what
then
might
she
be
expected
to
do
if
she
heard
of
his
death
if
he
met
it
in
some
nefarious
enterprise
her
lips
might
be
sealed
still
in
her
heart
she
must
retain
bitterness
and
hatred
against
those
who
had
killed
him
and
would
presumably
help
so
far
as
she
could
to
have
revenge
upon
them
could
we
see
her
then
and
try
to
use
her
that
was
my
first
thought
but
now
we
come
to
sinister
fact
miss
burnet
has
not
been
seen
by
any
human
eye
since
the
night
of
the
murder
from
that
evening
she
has
utterly
vanished
is
she
alive
has
she
perhaps
met
her
end
on
the
same
night
as
the
friend
whom
she
had
summoned
or
is
she
merely
prisoner
there
is
the
point
which
we
still
have
to
decide
you
will
appreciate
the
difficulty
of
the
situation
watson
there
is
nothing
upon
which
we
can
apply
for
warrant
our
whole
scheme
might
seem
fantastic
if
laid
before
magistrate
the
woman
disappearance
counts
for
nothing
since
in
that
extraordinary
household
any
member
of
it
might
be
invisible
for
week
and
yet
she
may
at
the
present
moment
be
in
danger
of
her
life
all
can
do
is
to
watch
the
house
and
leave
my
agent
warner
on
guard
at
the
gates
we
can
let
such
situation
continue
if
the
law
can
do
nothing
we
must
take
the
risk
ourselves
what
do
you
suggest
know
which
is
her
room
it
is
accessible
from
the
top
of
an
outhouse
my
suggestion
is
that
you
and
go
to
night
and
see
if
we
can
strike
at
the
very
heart
of
the
mystery
it
was
not
must
confess
very
alluring
prospect
the
old
house
with
its
atmosphere
of
murder
the
singular
and
formidable
inhabitants
the
unknown
dangers
of
the
approach
and
the
fact
that
we
were
putting
ourselves
legally
in
false
position
all
combined
to
damp
my
ardour
but
there
was
something
in
the
icecold
reasoning
of
holmes
which
made
it
impossible
to
shrink
from
any
adventure
which
he
might
recommend
one
knew
that
thus
and
only
thus
could
solution
be
found
clasped
his
hand
in
silence
and
the
die
was
cast

but
it
was
not
destined
that
our
investigation
should
have
so
adventurous
an
ending
it
was
about
five
clock
and
the
shadows
of
the
march
evening
were
beginning
to
fall
when
an
excited
rustic
rushed
into
our
room
they
ve
gone
mr
holmes
they
went
by
the
last
train
the
lady
broke
away
and
ve
got
her
in
cab
downstairs
excellent
warner
cried
holmes
springing
to
his
feet
watson
the
gaps
are
closing
rapidly
in
the
cab
was
woman
half
collapsed
from
nervous
exhaustion
she
bore
upon
her
aquiline
and
emaciated
face
the
traces
of
some
recent
tragedy
her
head
hung
listlessly
upon
her
breast
but
as
she
raised
it
and
turned
her
dull
eyes
upon
us
saw
that
her
pupils
were
dark
dots
in
the
centre
of
the
broad
grey
iris
she
was
drugged
with
opium
watched
at
the
gate
same
as
you
advised
mr
holmes
said
our
emissary
the
discharged
gardener
when
the
carriage
came
out
followed
it
to
the
station
she
was
like
one
walking
in
her
sleep
but
when
they
tried
to
get
her
into
the
train
she
came
to
life
and
struggled
they
pushed
her
into
the
carriage
she
fought
her
way
out
again
took
her
part
got
her
into
cab
and
here
we
are
shan
forget
the
face
at
the
carriage
window
as
led
her
away
have
short
life
if
he
had
his
way
the
black
eyed
scowling
yellow
devil
we
carried
her
upstairs
laid
her
on
the
sofa
and
couple
of
cups
of
the
strongest
coffee
soon
cleared
her
brain
from
the
mists
of
the
drug
baynes
had
been
summoned
by
holmes
and
the
situation
rapidly
explained
to
him
why
sir
you
ve
got
me
the
very
evidence
want
said
the
inspector
warmly
shaking
my
friend
by
the
hand
was
on
the
same
scent
as
you
from
the
first
what
you
were
after
henderson
why
mr
holmes
when
you
were
crawling
in
the
shrubbery
at
high
gable
was
up
one
of
the
trees
in
the
plantation
and
saw
you
down
below
it
was
just
who
would
get
his
evidence
first
then
why
did
you
arrest
the
mulatto
baynes
chuckled
was
sure
henderson
as
he
calls
himself
felt
that
he
was
suspected
and
that
he
would
lie
low
and
make
no
move
so
long
as
he
thought
he
was
in
any
danger
arrested
the
wrong
man
to
make
him
believe
that
our
eyes
were
off
him
knew
he
would
be
likely
to
clear
off
then
and
give
us
chance
of
getting
at
miss
burnet
holmes
laid
his
hand
upon
the
inspector
shoulder
you
will
rise
high
in
your
profession
you
have
instinct
and
intuition
said
he
baynes
flushed
with
pleasure
ve
had
plain
clothes
man
waiting
at
the
station
all
the
week
wherever
the
high
gable
folk
go
he
will
keep
them
in
sight
but
he
must
have
been
hard
put
to
it
when
miss
burnet
broke
away
however
your
man
picked
her
up
and
it
all
ends
well
we
can
arrest
without
her
evidence
that
is
clear
so
the
sooner
we
get
statement
the
better
every
minute
she
gets
stronger
said
holmes
glancing
at
the
governess
but
tell
me
baynes
who
is
this
man
henderson
the
inspector
answered
is
don
murillo
once
call
the
tiger
of
san
pedro
the
tiger
of
san
pedro
the
whole
history
of
the
man
came
back
to
me
in
flash
he
had
made
his
name
as
the
most
lewd
and
bloodthirsty
tyrant
that
had
ever
governed
any
country
with
pretence
to
civilization
strong
fearless
and
energetic
he
had
sufficient
virtue
to
enable
him
to
impose
his
odious
vices
upon
cowering
people
for
ten
or
twelve
years
his
name
was
terror
through
all
central
america
at
the
end
of
that
time
there
was
universal
rising
against
him
but
he
was
as
cunning
as
he
was
cruel
and
at
the
first
whisper
of
coming
trouble
he
had
secretly
conveyed
his
treasures
aboard
ship
which
was
manned
by
devoted
adherents
it
was
an
empty
palace
which
was
stormed
by
the
insurgents
next
day
the
dictator
his
two
children
his
secretary
and
his
wealth
had
all
escaped
them
›From
that
moment
he
had
vanished
from
the
world
and
his
identity
had
been
frequent
subject
for
comment
in
the
european
press
yes
sir
don
murillo
the
tiger
of
san
pedro
said
baynes
if
you
look
it
up
you
will
find
that
the
san
pedro
colours
are
green
and
white
same
as
in
the
note
mr
holmes
henderson
he
called
himself
but
traced
him
back
paris
and
rome
and
madrid
to
barcelona
where
his
ship
came
in
86
they
ve
been
looking
for
him
all
the
time
for
their
revenge
but
it
is
only
now
that
they
have
begun
to
find
him
out
they
discovered
him
year
ago
said
miss
burnet
who
had
sat
up
and
was
now
intently
following
the
conversation
once
already
his
life
has
been
attempted
but
some
evil
spirit
shielded
him
now
again
it
is
the
noble
chivalrous
garcia
who
has
fallen
while
the
monster
goes
safe
but
another
will
come
and
yet
another
until
some
day
justice
will
be
done
that
is
as
certain
as
the
rise
of
to
morrow
sun
her
thin
hands
clenched
and
her
worn
face
blanched
with
the
passion
of
her
hatred
but
how
come
you
into
this
matter
miss
burnet
asked
holmes
how
can
an
english
lady
join
in
such
murderous
affair
join
in
it
because
there
is
no
other
way
in
the
world
by
which
justice
can
be
gained
what
does
the
law
of
england
care
for
the
rivers
of
blood
shed
years
ago
in
san
pedro
or
for
the
shipload
of
treasure
which
this
man
has
stolen
to
you
they
are
like
crimes
committed
in
some
other
planet
but
we
know
we
have
learned
the
truth
in
sorrow
and
in
suffering
to
us
there
is
no
fiend
in
hell
like
juan
murillo
and
no
peace
in
life
while
his
victims
still
cry
for
vengeance
no
doubt
said
holmes
he
was
as
you
say
have
heard
that
he
was
atrocious
but
how
are
you
affected
will
tell
you
it
all
this
villain
policy
was
to
murder
on
one
pretext
or
another
every
man
who
showed
such
promise
that
he
might
in
time
come
to
be
dangerous
rival
my
husband
yes
my
real
name
is
signora
victor
durando
was
the
san
pedro
minister
in
london
he
met
me
and
married
me
there
nobler
man
never
lived
upon
earth
unhappily
murillo
heard
of
his
excellence
recalled
him
on
some
pretext
and
had
him
shot
with
premonition
of
his
fate
he
had
refused
to
take
me
with
him
his
estates
were
confiscated
and
was
left
with
pittance
and
broken
heart
then
came
the
downfall
of
the
tyrant
he
escaped
as
you
have
just
described
but
the
many
whose
lives
he
had
ruined
whose
nearest
and
dearest
had
suffered
torture
and
death
at
his
hands
would
not
let
the
matter
rest
they
banded
themselves
into
society
which
should
never
be
dissolved
until
the
work
was
done
it
was
my
part
after
we
had
discovered
in
the
transformed
henderson
the
fallen
despot
to
attach
myself
to
his
household
and
keep
the
others
in
touch
with
his
movements
this
was
able
to
do
by
securing
the
position
of
governess
in
his
family
he
little
knew
that
the
woman
who
faced
him
at
every
meal
was
the
woman
whose
husband
he
had
hurried
at
an
hour
notice
into
eternity
smiled
on
him
did
my
duty
to
his
children
and
bided
my
time
an
attempt
was
made
in
paris
and
failed
we
zigzagged
swiftly
here
and
there
over
europe
to
throw
off
the
pursuers
and
finally
returned
to
this
house
which
he
had
taken
upon
his
first
arrival
in
england
but
here
also
the
ministers
of
justice
were
waiting
knowing
that
he
would
return
there
garcia
who
is
the
son
of
the
former
highest
dignitary
in
san
pedro
was
waiting
with
two
trusty
companions
of
humble
station
all
three
fired
with
the
same
reasons
for
revenge
he
could
do
little
during
the
day
for
murillo
took
every
precaution
and
never
went
out
save
with
his
satellite
lucas
or
lopez
as
he
was
known
in
the
days
of
his
greatness
at
night
however
he
slept
alone
and
the
avenger
might
find
him
on
certain
evening
which
had
been
prearranged
sent
my
friend
final
instructions
for
the
man
was
forever
on
the
alert
and
continually
changed
his
room
was
to
see
that
the
doors
were
open
and
the
signal
of
green
or
white
light
in
window
which
faced
the
drive
was
to
give
notice
if
all
was
safe
or
if
the
attempt
had
better
be
postponed
but
everything
went
wrong
with
us
in
some
way
had
excited
the
suspicion
of
lopez
the
secretary
he
crept
up
behind
me
and
sprang
upon
me
just
as
had
finished
the
note
he
and
his
master
dragged
me
to
my
room
and
held
judgment
upon
me
as
convicted
traitress
then
and
there
they
would
have
plunged
their
knives
into
me
could
they
have
seen
how
to
escape
the
consequences
of
the
deed
finally
after
much
debate
they
concluded
that
my
murder
was
too
dangerous
but
they
determined
to
get
rid
forever
of
garcia
they
had
gagged
me
and
murillo
twisted
my
arm
round
until
gave
him
the
address
swear
that
he
might
have
twisted
it
off
had
understood
what
it
would
mean
to
garcia
lopez
addressed
the
note
which
had
written
sealed
it
with
his
sleeve
link
and
sent
it
by
the
hand
of
the
servant
jose
how
they
murdered
him
do
not
know
save
that
it
was
murillo
hand
who
struck
him
down
for
lopez
had
remained
to
guard
me
believe
he
must
have
waited
among
the
gorse
bushes
through
which
the
path
winds
and
struck
him
down
as
he
passed
at
first
they
were
of
mind
to
let
him
enter
the
house
and
to
kill
him
as
detected
burglar
but
they
argued
that
if
they
were
mixed
up
in
an
inquiry
their
own
identity
would
at
once
be
publicly
disclosed
and
they
would
be
open
to
further
attacks
with
the
death
of
garcia
the
pursuit
might
cease
since
such
death
might
frighten
others
from
the
task

all
would
now
have
been
well
for
them
had
it
not
been
for
my
knowledge
of
what
they
had
done
have
no
doubt
that
there
were
times
when
my
life
hung
in
the
balance
was
confined
to
my
room
terrorized
by
the
most
horrible
threats
cruelly
ill
used
to
break
my
spirit
see
this
stab
on
my
shoulder
and
the
bruises
from
end
to
end
of
my
arms
and
gag
was
thrust
into
my
mouth
on
the
one
occasion
when
tried
to
call
from
the
window
for
five
days
this
cruel
imprisonment
continued
with
hardly
enough
food
to
hold
body
and
soul
together
this
afternoon
good
lunch
was
brought
me
but
the
moment
after
took
it
knew
that
had
been
drugged
in
sort
of
dream
remember
being
half
led
halfcarried
to
the
carriage
in
the
same
state
was
conveyed
to
the
train
only
then
when
the
wheels
were
almost
moving
did
suddenly
realize
that
my
liberty
lay
in
my
own
hands
sprang
out
they
tried
to
drag
me
back
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
help
of
this
good
man
who
led
me
to
the
cab
should
never
had
broken
away
now
thank
god
am
beyond
their
power
forever
we
had
all
listened
intently
to
this
remarkable
statement
it
was
holmes
who
broke
the
silence
our
difficulties
are
not
over
he
remarked
shaking
his
head
our
police
work
ends
but
our
legal
work
begins
exactly
said
plausible
lawyer
could
make
it
out
as
an
act
of
self
defence
there
may
be
hundred
crimes
in
the
background
but
it
is
only
on
this
one
that
they
can
be
tried
come
said
baynes
cheerily
think
better
of
the
law
than
that
self
defence
is
one
thing
to
entice
man
in
cold
blood
with
the
object
of
murdering
him
is
another
whatever
danger
you
may
fear
from
him
no
we
shall
all
be
justified
when
we
see
the
tenants
of
high
gable
at
the
next
guildford
assizes
it
is
matter
of
history
however
that
little
time
was
still
to
elapse
before
the
tiger
of
san
pedro
should
meet
with
his
deserts
wily
and
bold
he
and
his
companion
threw
their
pursuer
off
their
track
by
entering
lodging
house
in
edmonton
street
and
leaving
by
the
back
gate
into
curzon
square
from
that
day
they
were
seen
no
more
in
england
some
six
months
afterwards
the
marquess
of
montalva
and
signor
rulli
his
secretary
were
both
murdered
in
their
rooms
at
the
hotel
escurial
at
madrid
the
crime
was
ascribed
to
nihilism
and
the
murderers
were
never
arrested
inspector
baynes
visited
us
at
baker
street
with
printed
description
of
the
dark
face
of
the
secretary
and
of
the
masterful
features
the
magnetic
black
eyes
and
the
tufted
brows
of
his
master
we
could
not
doubt
that
justice
if
belated
had
come
at
last
chaotic
case
my
dear
watson
said
holmes
over
an
evening
pipe
it
will
not
be
possible
for
you
to
present
in
that
compact
form
which
is
dear
to
your
heart
it
covers
two
continents
concerns
two
groups
of
mysterious
persons
and
is
further
complicated
by
the
highly
respectable
presence
of
our
friend
scott
eccles
whose
inclusion
shows
me
that
the
deceased
garcia
had
scheming
mind
and
well
developed
instinct
of
selfpreservation
it
is
remarkable
only
for
the
fact
that
amid
perfect
jungle
of
possibilities
we
with
our
worthy
collaborator
the
inspector
have
kept
our
close
hold
on
the
essentials
and
so
been
guided
along
the
crooked
and
winding
path
is
there
any
point
which
is
not
quite
clear
to
you
the
object
of
the
mulatto
cook
return
think
that
the
strange
creature
in
the
kitchen
may
account
for
it
the
man
was
primitive
savage
from
the
backwoods
of
san
pedro
and
this
was
his
fetish
when
his
companion
and
he
had
fled
to
some
prearranged
retreat
already
occupied
no
doubt
by
confederate
the
companion
had
persuaded
him
to
leave
so
compromising
an
article
of
furniture
but
the
mulatto
heart
was
with
it
and
he
was
driven
back
to
it
next
day
when
on
reconnoitering
through
the
window
he
found
policeman
walters
in
possession
he
waited
three
days
longer
and
then
his
piety
or
his
superstition
drove
him
to
try
once
more
inspector
baynes
who
with
his
usual
astuteness
had
minimized
the
incident
before
me
had
really
recognized
its
importance
and
had
left
trap
into
which
the
creature
walked
any
other
point
watson
the
torn
bird
the
pail
of
blood
the
charred
bones
all
the
mystery
of
that
weird
kitchen
holmes
smiled
as
he
turned
up
an
entry
in
his
note
book
spent
morning
in
the
british
museum
reading
up
on
that
and
other
points
here
is
quotation
from
eckermann
voodooism
and
the
negroid
religions
the
true
voodoo
worshipper
attempts
nothing
of
importance
without
certain
sacrifices
which
are
intended
to
propitiate
his
unclean
gods
in
extreme
cases
these
rites
take
the
form
of
human
sacrifices
followed
by
cannibalism
the
more
usual
victims
are
white
cock
which
is
plucked
in
pieces
alive
or
black
goat
whose
throat
is
cut
and
body
burned
so
you
see
our
savage
friend
was
very
orthodox
in
his
ritual
it
is
grotesque
watson
holmes
added
as
he
slowly
fastened
his
notebook
but
as
have
had
occasion
to
remark
there
is
but
one
step
from
the
grotesque
to
the
horrible
iii
the
adventure
of
the
bruce
partington
plans
in
the
third
week
of
november
in
the
year
1895
dense
yellow
fog
settled
down
upon
london
from
the
monday
to
the
thursday
doubt
whether
it
was
ever
possible
from
our
windows
in
baker
street
to
see
the
loom
of
the
opposite
houses
the
first
day
holmes
had
spent
in
cross
indexing
his
huge
book
of
references
the
second
and
third
had
been
patiently
occupied
upon
subject
which
he
hand
recently
made
his
hobby
the
music
of
the
middle
ages
but
when
for
the
fourth
time
after
pushing
back
our
chairs
from
breakfast
we
saw
the
greasy
heavy
brown
swirl
still
drifting
past
us
and
condensing
in
oily
drops
upon
the
windowpanes
my
comrade
impatient
and
active
nature
could
endure
this
drab
existence
no
longer
he
paced
restlessly
about
our
sittingroom
in
fever
of
suppressed
energy
biting
his
nails
tapping
the
furniture
and
chafing
against
inaction
nothing
of
interest
in
the
paper
watson
he
said
in
was
aware
that
by
anything
of
interest
holmes
meant
anything
of
criminal
interest
there
was
the
news
of
revolution
of
possible
war
and
of
an
impending
change
of
government
but
these
did
not
come
within
the
horizon
of
my
companion
could
see
nothing
recorded
in
the
shape
of
crime
which
was
not
commonplace
and
futile
holmes
groaned
and
resumed
hs
restless
meanderings
the
london
criminal
is
certainly
dull
fellow
said
he
in
the
querulous
voice
of
the
sportsman
whose
game
has
failed
him
look
out
this
window
watson
see
how
the
figures
loom
up
are
dimly
seen
and
then
blend
once
more
into
the
cloud
bank
the
thief
or
the
murderer
could
roam
london
on
such
day
as
the
tiger
does
the
jungle
unseen
until
he
pounces
and
then
evident
only
to
his
victim
there
have
said
been
numerous
petty
thefts
holmes
snorted
his
contempt
this
great
and
sombre
stage
is
set
for
something
more
worthy
than
that
said
he
it
is
fortunate
for
this
community
that
am
not
criminal
it
is
indeed
said
heartily
suppose
that
were
brooks
or
woodhouse
or
any
of
the
fifty
men
who
have
good
reason
for
taking
my
life
how
long
could
survive
against
my
own
pursuit
summons
bogus
appointment
and
all
would
be
over
it
is
well
they
don
have
days
of
fog
in
the
latin
countries
the
countries
of
assassination
by
jove
here
comes
something
at
last
to
break
our
dead
monotony
it
was
the
maid
with
telegram
holmes
tore
it
open
and
burst
out
laughing
well
what
next
said
he
brother
mycroft
is
coming
round
why
not
asked
why
not
it
is
as
if
you
met
tram
car
coming
down
country
lane
mycroft
has
his
rails
and
he
runs
on
them
his
pall
mall
lodgings
the
diogenes
club
whitehall
that
is
his
cycle
once
and
only
once
he
has
been
here
what
upheaval
can
possibly
have
derailed
him
does
he
not
explain
holmes
handed
me
his
brother
telegram
must
see
you
over
cadogen
west
coming
at
once
mycroft
cadogen
west
have
heard
the
name
it
recalls
nothing
to
my
mind
but
that
mycroft
should
break
out
in
this
erratic
fashion
planet
might
as
well
leave
its
orbit
by
the
way
do
you
know
what
mycroft
is
had
some
vague
recollection
of
an
explanation
at
the
time
of
the
adventure
of
the
greek
interpreter
you
told
me
that
he
had
some
small
office
under
the
british
government
holmes
chuckled
did
not
know
you
quite
so
well
in
those
days
one
has
to
be
discreet
when
one
talks
of
high
matters
of
state
you
are
right
in
thinking
that
he
under
the
british
government
you
would
also
be
right
in
sense
if
you
said
that
occasionally
he
is
the
british
government
my
dear
holmes
thought
might
surprise
you
mycroft
draws
four
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
year
remains
subordinate
has
no
ambitions
of
any
kind
will
receive
neither
honour
nor
title
but
remains
the
most
indispensable
man
in
the
country

but
how
well
his
position
is
unique
he
has
made
it
for
himself
there
has
never
been
anything
like
it
before
nor
will
be
again
he
has
the
tidiest
and
most
orderly
brain
with
the
greatest
capacity
for
storing
facts
of
any
man
living
the
same
great
powers
which
have
turned
to
the
detection
of
crime
he
has
used
for
this
particular
business
the
conclusions
of
every
department
are
passed
to
him
and
he
is
the
central
exchange
the
clearinghouse
which
makes
out
the
balance
all
other
men
are
specialists
but
his
specialism
is
omniscience
we
will
suppose
that
minister
needs
information
as
to
point
which
involves
the
navy
india
canada
and
the
bimetallic
question
he
could
get
his
separate
advices
from
various
departments
upon
each
but
only
mycroft
can
focus
them
all
and
say
offhand
how
each
factor
would
affect
the
other
they
began
by
using
him
as
short
cut
convenience
now
he
has
made
himself
an
essential
in
that
great
brain
of
his
everything
is
pigeon
holed
and
can
be
handed
out
in
an
instant
again
and
again
his
word
has
decided
the
national
policy
he
lives
in
it
he
thinks
of
nothing
else
save
when
as
an
intellectual
exercise
he
unbends
if
call
upon
him
and
ask
him
to
advise
me
on
one
of
my
little
problems
but
jupiter
is
descending
to
day
what
on
earth
can
it
mean
who
is
cadogan
west
and
what
is
he
to
mycroft
have
it
cried
and
plunged
among
the
litter
of
papers
upon
the
sofa
yes
here
he
is
sure
enough
cadogen
west
was
the
young
man
who
was
found
dead
on
the
underground
on
tuesday
morning
holmes
sat
up
at
attention
his
pipe
halfway
to
his
lips
this
must
be
serious
watson
death
which
has
caused
my
brother
to
alter
his
habits
can
be
no
ordinary
one
what
in
the
world
can
he
have
to
do
with
it
the
case
was
featureless
as
remember
it
the
young
man
had
apparently
fallen
out
of
the
train
and
killed
himself
he
had
not
been
robbed
and
there
was
no
particular
reason
to
suspect
violence
is
that
not
so
there
has
been
an
inquest
said
and
good
many
fresh
facts
have
come
out
looked
at
more
closely
should
certainly
say
that
it
was
curious
case
judging
by
its
effect
upon
my
brother
should
think
it
must
be
most
extraordinary
one
he
snuggled
down
in
his
armchair
now
watson
let
us
have
the
facts
the
man
name
was
arthur
cadogan
west
he
was
twenty
seven
years
of
age
unmarried
and
clerk
at
woolwich
arsenal
government
employ
behold
the
link
with
brother
mycroft
he
left
woolwich
suddenly
on
monday
night
was
last
seen
by
his
fiancee
miss
violet
westbury
whom
he
left
abruptly
in
the
fog
about
30
that
evening
there
was
no
quarrel
between
them
and
she
can
give
no
motive
for
his
action
the
next
thing
heard
of
him
was
when
his
dead
body
was
discovered
by
plate
layer
named
mason
just
outside
aldgate
station
on
the
underground
system
in
london
when
the
body
was
found
at
six
on
tuesday
morning
it
was
lying
wide
of
the
metals
upon
the
left
hand
of
the
track
as
one
goes
eastward
at
point
close
to
the
station
where
the
line
emerges
from
the
tunnel
in
which
it
runs
the
head
was
badly
crushed
an
injury
which
might
well
have
been
caused
by
fall
from
the
train
the
body
could
only
have
come
on
the
line
in
that
way
had
it
been
carried
down
from
any
neighbouring
street
it
must
have
passed
the
station
barriers
where
collector
is
always
standing
this
point
seems
absolutely
certain
very
good
the
case
is
definite
enough
the
man
dead
or
alive
either
fell
or
was
precipitated
from
train
so
much
is
clear
to
me
continue
the
trains
which
traverse
the
lines
of
rail
beside
which
the
body
was
found
are
those
which
run
from
west
to
east
some
being
purely
metropolitan
and
some
from
willesden
and
outlying
junctions
it
can
be
stated
for
certain
that
this
young
man
when
he
met
his
death
was
travelling
in
this
direction
at
some
late
hour
of
the
night
but
at
what
point
he
entered
the
train
it
is
impossible
to
state
his
ticket
of
course
would
show
that
there
was
no
ticket
in
his
pockets
no
ticket
dear
me
watson
this
is
really
very
singular
according
to
my
experience
it
is
not
possible
to
reach
the
platform
of
metropolitan
train
without
exhibiting
one
ticket
presumably
then
the
young
man
had
one
was
it
taken
from
him
in
order
to
conceal
the
station
from
which
he
came
it
is
possible
or
did
he
drop
it
in
the
carriage
that
is
also
possible
but
the
point
is
of
curious
interest
understand
that
there
was
no
sign
of
robbery
apparently
not
there
is
list
here
of
his
possessions
his
purse
contained
two
pounds
fifteen
he
had
also
check
book
on
the
woolwich
branch
of
the
capital
and
counties
bank
through
this
his
identity
was
established
there
were
also
two
dresscircle
tickets
for
the
woolwich
theatre
dated
for
that
very
evening
also
small
packet
of
technical
papers
holmes
gave
an
exclamation
of
satisfaction
there
we
have
it
at
last
watson
british
government
woolwich
arsenal
technical
papers
brother
mycroft
the
chain
is
complete
but
here
he
comes
if
am
not
mistaken
to
speak
for
himself
moment
later
the
tall
and
portly
form
of
mycroft
holmes
was
ushered
into
the
room
heavily
built
and
massive
there
was
suggestion
of
uncouth
physical
inertia
in
the
figure
but
above
this
unwieldy
frame
there
was
perched
head
so
masterful
in
its
brow
so
alert
in
its
steel
grey
deep
set
eyes
so
firm
in
its
lips
and
so
subtle
in
its
play
of
expression
that
after
the
first
glance
one
forgot
the
gross
body
and
remembered
only
the
dominant
mind
at
his
heels
came
our
old
friend
lestrade
of
scotland
yard
thin
and
austere
the
gravity
of
both
their
faces
foretold
some
weighty
quest
the
detective
shook
hands
without
word
mycroft
holmes
struggled
out
of
his
overcoat
and
subsided
into
an
armchair
most
annoying
business
sherlock
said
he
extremely
dislike
altering
my
habits
but
the
powers
that
be
would
take
no
denial
in
the
present
state
of
siam
it
is
most
awkward
that
should
be
away
from
the
office
but
it
is
real
crisis
have
never
seen
the
prime
minister
so
upset
as
to
the
admiralty
it
is
buzzing
like
an
overturned
bee
hive
have
you
read
up
the
case
we
have
just
done
so
what
were
the
technical
papers
ah
there
the
point
fortunately
it
has
not
come
out
the
press
would
be
furious
if
it
did
the
papers
which
this
wretched
youth
had
in
his
pocket
were
the
plans
of
the
bruce
partington
submarine
mycroft
holmes
spoke
with
solemnity
which
showed
his
sense
of
the
importance
of
the
subject
his
brother
and
sat
expectant
surely
you
have
heard
of
it
thought
everyone
had
heard
of
it
only
as
name
its
importance
can
hardly
be
exaggerated
it
has
been
the
most
jealously
guarded
of
all
government
secrets
you
may
take
it
from
me
that
naval
warfare
becomes
impossible
withing
the
radius
of
bruce
partington
operation
two
years
ago
very
large
sum
was
smuggled
through
the
estimates
and
was
expended
in
acquiring
monopoly
of
the
invention
every
effort
has
been
made
to
keep
the
secret
the
plans
which
are
exceedingly
intricate
comprising
some
thirty
separate
patents
each
essential
to
the
working
of
the
whole
are
kept
in
an
elaborate
safe
in
confidential
office
adjoining
the
arsenal
with
burglar
proof
doors
and
windows
under
no
conceivable
circumstances
were
the
plans
to
be
taken
from
the
office
if
the
chief
constructor
of
the
navy
desired
to
consult
them
even
he
was
forced
to
go
to
the
woolwich
office
for
the
purpose
and
yet
here
we
find
them
in
the
pocket
of
dead
junior
clerk
in
the
heart
of
london
from
an
official
point
of
view
it
simply
awful
but
you
have
recovered
them
no
sherlock
no
that
the
pinch
we
have
not
ten
papers
were
taken
from
woolwich
there
were
seven
in
the
pocket
of
cadogan
west
the
three
most
essential
are
gone
stolen
vanished
you
must
drop
everything
sherlock
never
mind
your
usual
petty
puzzles
of
the
police
court
it
vital
international
problem
that
you
have
to
solve
why
did
cadogan
west
take
the
papers
where
are
the
missing
ones
how
did
he
die
how
came
his
body
where
it
was
found
how
can
the
evil
be
set
right
find
an
answer
to
all
these
questions
and
you
will
have
done
good
service
for
your
country
why
do
you
not
solve
it
yourself
mycroft
you
can
see
as
far
as
possibly
sherlock
but
it
is
question
of
getting
details
give
me
your
details
and
from
an
armchair
will
return
you
an
excellent
expert
opinion
but
to
run
here
and
run
there
to
cross
question
railway
guards
and
lie
on
my
face
with
lens
to
my
eye
it
is
not
my
metier
no
you
are
the
one
man
who
can
clear
the
matter
up
if
you
have
fancy
to
see
your
name
in
the
next
honours
list—
my
friend
smiled
and
shook
his
head
play
the
game
for
the
game
own
sake
said
he
but
the
problem
certainly
presents
some
points
of
interest
and
shall
be
very
pleased
to
look
into
it
some
more
facts

have
jotted
down
the
more
essential
ones
upon
this
sheet
of
paper
together
with
few
addresses
which
you
will
find
of
service
the
actual
official
guardian
of
the
papers
is
the
famous
government
expert
sir
james
walter
whose
decorations
and
sub
titles
fill
two
lines
of
book
of
reference
he
has
grown
grey
in
the
service
is
gentleman
favoured
guest
in
the
most
exalted
houses
and
above
all
man
whose
patriotism
is
beyond
suspicion
he
is
one
of
two
who
have
key
of
the
safe
may
add
that
the
papers
were
undoubtedly
in
the
office
during
working
hours
on
monday
and
that
sir
james
left
for
london
about
three
clock
taking
his
key
with
him
he
was
at
the
house
of
admiral
sinclair
at
barclay
square
during
the
whole
of
the
evening
when
this
incident
occurred
has
the
fact
been
verified
yes
his
brother
colonel
valentine
walter
has
testified
to
his
departure
from
woolwich
and
admiral
sinclair
to
his
arrival
in
london
so
sir
james
is
no
longer
direct
factor
in
the
problem
who
was
the
other
man
with
key
the
senior
clerk
and
draughtsman
mr
sidney
johnson
he
is
man
of
forty
married
with
five
children
he
is
silent
morose
man
but
he
has
on
the
whole
an
excellent
record
in
the
public
service
he
is
unpopular
with
his
colleagues
but
hard
worker
according
to
his
own
account
corroborated
only
by
the
word
of
his
wife
he
was
at
home
the
whole
of
monday
evening
after
office
hours
and
his
key
has
never
left
the
watch
chain
upon
which
it
hangs
tell
us
about
cadogan
west
he
has
been
ten
years
in
the
service
and
has
done
good
work
he
has
the
reputation
of
being
hot
headed
and
imperious
but
straight
honest
man
we
have
nothing
against
him
he
was
next
sidney
johnson
in
the
office
his
duties
brought
him
into
daily
personal
contact
with
the
plans
no
one
else
had
the
handling
of
them
who
locked
up
the
plans
that
night
mr
sidney
johnson
the
senior
clerk
well
it
is
surely
perfectly
clear
who
took
them
away
they
are
actually
found
upon
the
person
of
this
junior
clerk
cadogan
west
that
seems
final
does
it
not
it
does
sherlock
and
yet
it
leaves
so
much
unexplained
in
the
first
place
why
did
he
take
them
presume
they
were
of
value
he
could
have
got
several
thousands
for
them
very
easily
can
you
suggest
any
possible
motive
for
taking
the
papers
to
london
except
to
sell
them
no
cannot
then
we
must
take
that
as
our
working
hypothesis
young
west
took
the
papers
now
this
could
only
be
done
by
having
false
key—
several
false
keys
he
had
to
open
the
building
and
the
room
he
had
then
several
false
keys
he
took
the
papers
to
london
to
sell
the
secret
intending
no
doubt
to
have
the
plans
themselves
back
in
the
safe
next
morning
before
they
were
missed
while
in
london
on
this
treasonable
mission
he
met
his
end
how
we
will
suppose
that
he
was
travelling
back
to
woolwich
when
he
was
killed
and
thrown
out
of
the
compartment
aldgate
where
the
body
was
found
is
considerably
past
the
station
london
bridge
which
would
be
his
route
to
woolwich
many
circumstances
could
be
imagined
under
which
he
would
pass
london
bridge
there
was
someone
in
the
carriage
for
example
with
whom
he
was
having
an
absorbing
interview
this
interview
led
to
violent
scene
in
which
he
lost
his
life
possibly
he
tried
to
leave
the
carriage
fell
out
on
the
line
and
so
met
his
end
the
other
closed
the
door
there
was
thick
fog
and
nothing
could
be
seen
no
better
explanation
can
be
given
with
our
present
knowledge
and
yet
consider
sherlock
how
much
you
leave
untouched
we
will
suppose
for
argument
sake
that
young
cadogan
west
had
determined
to
convey
these
papers
to
london
he
would
naturally
have
made
an
appointment
with
the
foreign
agent
and
kept
his
evening
clear
instead
of
that
he
took
two
tickets
for
the
theatre
escorted
his
fiancee
halfway
there
and
then
suddenly
disappeared
blind
said
lestrade
who
had
sat
listening
with
some
impatience
to
the
conversation
very
singular
one
that
is
objection
no
objection
no
we
will
suppose
that
he
reaches
london
and
sees
the
foreign
agent
he
must
bring
back
the
papers
before
morning
or
the
loss
will
be
discovered
he
took
away
ten
only
seven
were
in
his
pocket
what
had
become
of
the
other
three
he
certainly
would
not
leave
them
of
his
own
free
will
then
again
where
is
the
price
of
his
treason
once
would
have
expected
to
find
large
sum
of
money
in
his
pocket
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
clear
said
lestrade
have
no
doubt
at
all
as
to
what
occurred
he
took
the
papers
to
sell
them
he
saw
the
agent
they
could
not
agree
as
to
price
he
started
home
again
but
the
agent
went
with
him
in
the
train
the
agent
murdered
him
took
the
more
essential
papers
and
threw
his
body
from
the
carriage
that
would
account
for
everything
would
it
not
why
had
he
no
ticket
the
ticket
would
have
shown
which
station
was
nearest
the
agent
house
therefore
he
took
it
from
the
murdered
man
pocket
good
lestrade
very
good
said
holmes
your
theory
holds
together
but
if
this
is
true
then
the
case
is
at
an
end
on
the
one
hand
the
traitor
is
dead
on
the
other
the
plans
of
the
bruce
partington
submarine
are
presumably
already
on
the
continent
what
is
there
for
us
to
do
to
act
sherlock
to
act
cried
mycroft
springing
to
his
feet
all
my
instincts
are
against
this
explanation
use
your
powers
go
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
see
the
people
concerned
leave
no
stone
unturned
in
all
your
career
you
have
never
had
so
great
chance
of
serving
your
country
well
said
holmes
shrugging
his
shoulders
come
watson
and
you
lestrade
could
you
favour
us
with
your
company
for
an
hour
or
two
we
will
begin
our
investigation
by
visit
to
aldgate
station
good
bye
mycroft
shall
let
you
have
report
before
evening
but
warn
you
in
advance
that
you
have
little
to
expect
an
hour
later
holmes
lestrade
and
stood
upon
the
underground
railroad
at
the
point
where
it
emerges
from
the
tunnel
immediately
before
aldgate
station
courteous
red
faced
old
gentleman
represented
the
railway
company
this
is
where
the
young
man
body
lay
said
he
indicating
spot
about
three
feet
from
the
metals
it
could
not
have
fallen
from
above
for
these
as
you
see
are
all
blank
walls
therefore
it
could
only
have
come
from
train
and
that
train
so
far
as
we
can
trace
it
must
have
passed
about
midnight
on
monday
have
the
carriages
been
examined
for
any
sign
of
violence
there
are
no
such
signs
and
no
ticket
has
been
found
no
record
of
door
being
found
open
none
we
have
had
some
fresh
evidence
this
morning
said
lestrade
passenger
who
passed
aldgate
in
an
ordinary
metropolitan
train
about
11
40
on
monday
night
declares
that
he
heard
heavy
thud
as
of
body
striking
the
line
just
before
the
train
reached
the
station
there
was
dense
fog
however
and
nothing
could
be
seen
he
made
no
report
of
it
at
the
time
why
whatever
is
the
matter
with
mr
holmes
my
friend
was
standing
with
an
expression
of
strained
intensity
upon
his
face
staring
at
the
railway
metals
where
they
curved
out
of
the
tunnel
aldgate
is
junction
and
there
was
network
of
points
on
these
his
eager
questioning
eyes
were
fixed
and
saw
on
his
keen
alert
face
that
tightening
of
the
lips
that
quiver
of
the
nostrils
and
concentration
of
the
heavy
tufted
brows
which
knew
so
well
points
he
muttered
the
points
what
of
it
what
do
you
mean
suppose
there
are
no
great
number
of
points
on
system
such
as
this
no
they
are
very
few
and
curve
too
points
and
curve
by
jove
if
it
were
only
so
what
is
it
mr
holmes
have
you
clue
an
idea
an
indication
no
more
but
the
case
certainly
grows
in
interest
unique
perfectly
unique
and
yet
why
not
do
not
see
any
indications
of
bleeding
on
the
line
there
were
hardly
any
but
understand
that
there
was
considerable
wound
the
bone
was
crushed
but
there
was
no
great
external
injury
and
yet
one
would
have
expected
some
bleeding
would
it
be
possible
for
me
to
inspect
the
train
which
contained
the
passenger
who
heard
the
thud
of
fall
in
the
fog
fear
not
mr
holmes
the
train
has
been
broken
up
before
now
and
the
carriages
redistributed
can
assure
you
mr
holmes
said
lestrade
that
every
carriage
has
been
carefully
examined
saw
to
it
myself
it
was
one
of
my
friend
most
obvious
weaknesses
that
he
was
impatient
with
less
alert
intelligences
than
his
own
very
likely
said
he
turning
away
as
it
happens
it
was
not
the
carriages
which
desired
to
examine
watson
we
have
done
all
we
can
here
we
need
not
trouble
you
any
further
mr
lestrade
think
our
investigations
must
now
carry
us
to
woolwich

holmes

watson
he
remarked
as
we
took
our
seats
in
the
woolwich
train
we
certainly
owe
brother
mycroft
debt
for
having
introduced
us
to
what
promises
to
be
really
very
remarkable
case
his
eager
face
still
wore
that
expression
of
intense
and
highstrung
energy
which
showed
me
that
some
novel
and
suggestive
circumstance
had
opened
up
stimulating
line
of
thought
see
the
foxhound
with
hanging
ears
and
drooping
tail
as
it
lolls
about
the
kennels
and
compare
it
with
the
same
hound
as
with
gleaming
eyes
and
straining
muscles
it
runs
upon
breast
high
scent
such
was
the
change
in
holmes
since
the
morning
he
was
different
man
from
the
limp
and
lounging
figure
in
the
mousecoloured
dressing
gown
who
had
prowled
so
restlessly
only
few
hours
before
round
the
fog
girt
room
there
is
material
here
there
is
scope
said
he
am
dull
indeed
not
to
have
understood
its
possibilities
even
now
they
are
dark
to
me
the
end
is
dark
to
me
also
but
have
hold
of
one
idea
which
may
lead
us
far
the
man
met
his
death
elsewhere
and
his
body
was
on
the
roof
of
carriage
on
the
roof
remarkable
is
it
not
but
consider
the
facts
is
it
coincidence
that
it
is
found
at
the
very
point
where
the
train
pitches
and
sways
as
it
comes
round
on
the
points
is
not
that
the
place
where
an
object
upon
the
roof
might
be
expected
to
fall
off
the
points
would
affect
no
object
inside
the
train
either
the
body
fell
from
the
roof
or
very
curious
coincidence
has
occurred
but
now
consider
the
question
of
the
blood
of
course
there
was
no
bleeding
on
the
line
if
the
body
had
bled
elsewhere
each
fact
is
suggestive
in
itself
together
they
have
cumulative
force
and
the
ticket
too
cried
exactly
we
could
not
explain
the
absence
of
ticket
this
would
explain
it
everything
fits
together
but
suppose
it
were
so
we
are
still
as
far
as
ever
from
unravelling
the
mystery
of
his
death
indeed
it
becomes
not
simpler
but
stranger
perhaps
said
holmes
thoughtfully
perhaps
he
relapsed
into
silent
reverie
which
lasted
until
the
slow
train
drew
up
at
last
in
woolwich
station
there
he
called
cab
and
drew
mycroft
paper
from
his
pocket
we
have
quite
little
round
of
afternoon
calls
to
make
said
he
think
that
sir
james
walter
claims
our
first
attention
the
house
of
the
famous
official
was
fine
villa
with
green
lawns
stretching
down
to
the
thames
as
we
reached
it
the
fog
was
lifting
and
thin
watery
sunshine
was
breaking
through
butler
answered
our
ring
sir
james
sir
said
he
with
solemn
face
sir
james
died
this
morning
good
heavens
cried
holmes
in
amazement
how
did
he
die
perhaps
you
would
care
to
step
in
sir
and
see
his
brother
colonel
valentine
yes
we
had
best
do
so
we
were
ushered
into
dim
lit
drawing
room
where
an
instant
later
we
were
joined
by
very
tall
handsome
light
beared
man
of
fifty
the
younger
brother
of
the
dead
scientist
his
wild
eyes
stained
cheeks
and
unkempt
hair
all
spoke
of
the
sudden
blow
which
had
fallen
upon
the
household
he
was
hardly
articulate
as
he
spoke
of
it
was
this
horrible
scandal
said
he
my
brother
sir
james
was
man
of
very
sensitive
honour
and
he
could
not
survive
such
an
affair
it
broke
his
heart
he
was
always
so
proud
of
the
efficiency
of
his
department
and
this
was
crushing
blow
we
had
hoped
that
he
might
have
given
us
some
indications
which
would
have
helped
us
to
clear
the
matter
up
assure
you
that
it
was
all
mystery
to
him
as
it
is
to
you
and
to
all
of
us
he
had
already
put
all
his
knowledge
at
the
disposal
of
the
police
naturally
he
had
no
doubt
that
cadogan
west
was
guilty
but
all
the
rest
was
inconceivable
you
cannot
throw
any
new
light
upon
the
affair
know
nothing
myself
save
what
have
read
or
heard
have
no
desire
to
be
discourteous
but
you
can
understand
mr
holmes
that
we
are
much
disturbed
at
present
and
must
ask
you
to
hasten
this
interview
to
an
end
this
is
indeed
an
unexpected
development
said
my
friend
when
we
had
regained
the
cab
wonder
if
the
death
was
natural
or
whether
the
poor
old
fellow
killed
himself
if
the
latter
may
it
be
taken
as
some
sign
of
self
reproach
for
duty
neglected
we
must
leave
that
question
to
the
future
now
we
shall
turn
to
the
cadogan
wests
small
but
well
kept
house
in
the
outskirts
of
the
town
sheltered
the
bereaved
mother
the
old
lady
was
too
dazed
with
grief
to
be
of
any
use
to
us
but
at
her
side
was
white
faced
young
lady
who
introduced
herself
as
miss
violet
westbury
the
fiancee
of
the
dead
man
and
the
last
to
see
him
upon
that
fatal
night
cannot
explain
it
mr
holmes
she
said
have
not
shut
an
eye
since
the
tragedy
thinking
night
and
day
what
the
true
meaning
of
it
can
be
arthur
was
the
most
single
minded
chivalrous
patriotic
man
upon
earth
he
would
have
cut
his
right
hand
off
before
he
would
sell
state
secret
confided
to
his
keeping
it
is
absurd
impossible
preposterous
to
anyone
who
knew
him
but
the
facts
miss
westbury
yes
admit
cannot
explain
them
was
he
in
any
want
of
money
no
his
needs
were
very
simple
and
his
salary
ample
he
had
saved
few
hundreds
and
we
were
to
marry
at
the
new
year
no
signs
of
any
mental
excitement
come
miss
westbury
be
absolutely
frank
with
us
the
quick
eye
of
my
companion
had
noted
some
change
in
her
manner
she
coloured
and
hesitated
yes
she
said
at
last
had
feeling
that
there
was
something
on
his
mind
for
long
only
for
the
last
week
or
so
he
was
thoughtful
and
worried
once
pressed
him
about
it
he
admitted
that
there
was
something
and
that
it
was
concerned
with
his
official
life
it
is
too
serious
for
me
to
speak
about
even
to
you
said
he
could
get
nothing
more
holmes
looked
grave
go
on
miss
westbury
even
if
it
seems
to
tell
against
him
go
on
we
cannot
say
what
it
may
lead
to
indeed
have
nothing
more
to
tell
once
or
twice
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
telling
me
something
he
spoke
one
evening
of
the
importance
of
the
secret
and
have
some
recollection
that
he
said
that
no
doubt
foreign
spies
would
pay
great
deal
to
have
it
my
friend
face
grew
graver
still
anything
else
he
said
that
we
were
slack
about
such
matters
that
it
would
be
easy
for
traitor
to
get
the
plans
was
it
only
recently
that
he
made
such
remarks
yes
quite
recently
now
tell
us
of
that
last
evening
we
were
to
go
to
the
theatre
the
fog
was
so
thick
that
cab
was
useless
we
walked
and
our
way
took
us
close
to
the
office
suddenly
he
darted
away
into
the
fog
without
word
he
gave
an
exclamation
that
was
all
waited
but
he
never
returned
then
walked
home
next
morning
after
the
office
opened
they
came
to
inquire
about
twelve
clock
we
heard
the
terrible
news
oh
mr
holmes
if
you
could
only
save
his
honour
it
was
so
much
to
him
holmes
shook
his
head
sadly
come
watson
said
he
our
ways
lie
elsewhere
our
next
station
must
be
the
office
from
which
the
papers
were
taken
it
was
black
enough
before
against
this
young
man
but
our
inquiries
make
it
blacker
he
remarked
as
the
cab
lumbered
off
his
coming
marriage
gives
motive
for
the
crime
he
naturally
wanted
money
the
idea
was
in
his
head
since
he
spoke
about
it
he
nearly
made
the
girl
an
accomplice
in
the
treason
by
telling
her
his
plans
it
is
all
very
bad
but
surely
holmes
character
goes
for
something
then
again
why
should
he
leave
the
girl
in
the
street
and
dart
away
to
commit
felony
exactly
there
are
certainly
objections
but
it
is
formidable
case
which
they
have
to
meet
mr
sidney
johnson
the
senior
clerk
met
us
at
the
office
and
received
us
with
that
respect
which
my
companion
card
always
commanded
he
was
thin
gruff
bespectacled
man
of
middle
age
his
cheeks
haggard
and
his
hands
twitching
from
the
nervous
strain
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
it
is
bad
mr
holmes
very
bad
have
you
heard
of
the
death
of
the
chief
we
have
just
come
from
his
house
the
place
is
disorganized
the
chief
dead
cadogan
west
dead
our
papers
stolen
and
yet
when
we
closed
our
door
on
monday
evening
we
were
as
efficient
an
office
as
any
in
the
government
service
good
god
it
dreadful
to
think
of
that
west
of
all
men
should
have
done
such
thing

you
are
sure
of
his
guilt
then
can
see
no
other
way
out
of
it
and
yet
would
have
trusted
him
as
trust
myself
at
what
hour
was
the
office
closed
on
monday
at
five
did
you
close
it
am
always
the
last
man
out
where
were
the
plans
in
that
safe
put
them
there
myself
is
there
no
watchman
to
the
building
there
is
but
he
has
other
departments
to
look
after
as
well
he
is
an
old
soldier
and
most
trustworthy
man
he
saw
nothing
that
evening
of
course
the
fog
was
very
thick
suppose
that
cadogan
west
wished
to
make
his
way
into
the
building
after
hours
he
would
need
three
keys
would
he
not
before
the
could
reach
the
papers
yes
he
would
the
key
of
the
outer
door
the
key
of
the
office
and
the
key
of
the
safe
only
sir
james
walter
and
you
had
those
keys
had
no
keys
of
the
doors
only
of
the
safe
was
sir
james
man
who
was
orderly
in
his
habits
yes
think
he
was
know
that
so
far
as
those
three
keys
are
concerned
he
kept
them
on
the
same
ring
have
often
seen
them
there
and
that
ring
went
with
him
to
london
he
said
so
and
your
key
never
left
your
possession
never
then
west
if
he
is
the
culprit
must
have
had
duplicate
and
yet
none
was
found
upon
his
body
one
other
point
if
clerk
in
this
office
desired
to
sell
the
plans
would
it
not
be
simply
to
copy
the
plans
for
himself
than
to
take
the
originals
as
was
actually
done
it
would
take
considerable
technical
knowledge
to
copy
the
plans
in
an
effective
way
but
suppose
either
sir
james
or
you
or
west
has
that
technical
knowledge
no
doubt
we
had
but
beg
you
won
try
to
drag
me
into
the
matter
mr
holmes
what
is
the
use
of
our
speculating
in
this
way
when
the
original
plans
were
actually
found
on
west
well
it
is
certainly
singular
that
he
should
run
the
risk
of
taking
originals
if
he
could
safely
have
taken
copies
which
would
have
equally
served
his
turn
singular
no
doubt
and
yet
he
did
so
every
inquiry
in
this
case
reveals
something
inexplicable
now
there
are
three
papers
still
missing
they
are
as
understand
the
vital
ones
yes
that
is
so
do
you
mean
to
say
that
anyone
holding
these
three
papers
and
without
the
seven
others
could
construct
bruce
partington
submarine
reported
to
that
effect
to
the
admiralty
but
to
day
have
been
over
the
drawings
again
and
am
not
so
sure
of
it
the
double
valves
with
the
automatic
self
adjusting
slots
are
drawn
in
one
of
the
papers
which
have
been
returned
until
the
foreigners
had
invented
that
for
themselves
they
could
not
make
the
boat
of
course
they
might
soon
get
over
the
difficulty
but
the
three
missing
drawings
are
the
most
important
undoubtedly
think
with
your
permission
will
now
take
stroll
round
the
premises
do
not
recall
any
other
question
which
desired
to
ask
he
examined
the
lock
of
the
safe
the
door
of
the
room
and
finally
the
iron
shutters
of
the
window
it
was
only
when
we
were
on
the
lawn
outside
that
his
interest
was
strongly
excited
there
was
laurel
bush
outside
the
window
and
several
of
the
branches
bore
signs
of
having
been
twisted
or
snapped
he
examined
them
carefully
with
his
lens
and
then
some
dim
and
vague
marks
upon
the
earth
beneath
finally
he
asked
the
chief
clerk
to
close
the
iron
shutters
and
he
pointed
out
to
me
that
they
hardly
met
in
the
centre
and
that
it
would
be
possible
for
anyone
outside
to
see
what
was
going
on
within
the
room
the
indications
are
ruined
by
three
days
delay
they
may
mean
something
or
nothing
well
watson
do
not
think
that
woolwich
can
help
us
further
it
is
small
crop
which
we
have
gathered
let
us
see
if
we
can
do
better
in
london
yet
we
added
one
more
sheaf
to
our
harvest
before
we
left
woolwich
station
the
clerk
in
the
ticket
office
was
able
to
say
with
confidence
that
he
saw
cadogan
west
whom
he
knew
well
by
sight
upon
the
monday
night
and
that
he
went
to
london
by
the
15
to
london
bridge
he
was
alone
and
took
single
thirdclass
ticket
the
clerk
was
struck
at
the
time
by
his
excited
and
nervous
manner
so
shaky
was
he
that
he
could
hardly
pick
up
his
change
and
the
clerk
had
helped
him
with
it
reference
to
the
timetable
showed
that
the
15
was
the
first
train
which
it
was
possible
for
west
to
take
after
he
had
left
the
lady
about
30
let
us
reconstruct
watson
said
holmes
after
half
an
hour
of
silence
am
not
aware
that
in
all
our
joint
researches
we
have
ever
had
case
which
was
more
difficult
to
get
at
every
fresh
advance
which
we
make
only
reveals
fresh
ridge
beyond
and
yet
we
have
surely
made
some
appreciable
progress
the
effect
of
our
inquiries
at
woolwich
has
in
the
main
been
against
young
cadogan
west
but
the
indications
at
the
window
would
lend
themselves
to
more
favourable
hypothesis
let
us
suppose
for
example
that
he
had
been
approached
by
some
foreign
agent
it
might
have
been
done
under
such
pledges
as
would
have
prevented
him
from
speaking
of
it
and
yet
would
have
affected
his
thoughts
in
the
direction
indicated
by
his
remarks
to
his
fiancee
very
good
we
will
now
suppose
that
as
he
went
to
the
theatre
with
the
young
lady
he
suddenly
in
the
fog
caught
glimpse
of
this
same
agent
going
in
the
direction
of
the
office
he
was
an
impetuous
man
quick
in
his
decisions
everything
gave
way
to
his
duty
he
followed
the
man
reached
the
window
saw
the
abstraction
of
the
documents
and
pursued
the
thief
in
this
way
we
get
over
the
objection
that
no
one
would
take
originals
when
he
could
make
copies
this
outsider
had
to
take
originals
so
far
it
holds
together
what
is
the
next
step
then
we
come
into
difficulties
one
would
imagine
that
under
such
circumstances
the
first
act
of
young
cadogan
west
would
be
to
seize
the
villain
and
raise
the
alarm
why
did
he
not
do
so
could
it
have
been
an
official
superior
who
took
the
papers
that
would
explain
west
conduct
or
could
the
chief
have
given
west
the
slip
in
the
fog
and
west
started
at
once
to
london
to
head
him
off
from
his
own
rooms
presuming
that
he
knew
where
the
rooms
were
the
call
must
have
been
very
pressing
since
he
left
his
girl
standing
in
the
fog
and
made
no
effort
to
communicate
with
her
our
scent
runs
cold
here
and
there
is
vast
gap
between
either
hypothesis
and
the
laying
of
west
body
with
seven
papers
in
his
pocket
on
the
roof
of
metropolitan
train
my
instinct
now
is
to
work
from
the
other
end
if
mycroft
has
given
us
the
list
of
addresses
we
may
be
able
to
pick
our
man
and
follow
two
tracks
instead
of
one
surely
enough
note
awaited
us
at
baker
street
government
messenger
had
brought
it
post
haste
holmes
glanced
at
it
and
threw
it
over
to
me
there
are
numerous
small
fry
but
few
who
would
handle
so
big
an
affair
the
only
men
worth
considering
are
adolph
mayer
of
13
great
george
street
westminster
louis
la
rothiere
of
campden
mansions
notting
hill
and
hugo
oberstein
13
caulfield
gardens
kensington
the
latter
was
known
to
be
in
town
on
monday
and
is
now
reported
as
having
left
glad
to
hear
you
have
seen
some
light
the
cabinet
awaits
your
final
report
with
the
utmost
anxiety
urgent
representations
have
arrived
from
the
very
highest
quarter
the
whole
force
of
the
state
is
at
your
back
if
you
should
need
it
mycroft
afraid
said
holmes
smiling
that
all
the
queen
horses
and
all
the
queen
men
cannot
avail
in
this
matter
he
had
spread
out
his
big
map
of
london
and
leaned
eagerly
over
it
well
said
he
presently
with
an
exclamation
of
satisfaction
things
are
turning
little
in
our
direction
at
last
why
watson
do
honestly
believe
that
we
are
going
to
pull
it
off
after
all
he
slapped
me
on
the
shoulder
with
sudden
burst
of
hilarity
am
going
out
now
it
is
only
reconnaissance
will
do
nothing
serious
without
my
trusted
comrade
and
biographer
at
my
elbow
do
you
stay
here
and
the
odds
are
that
you
will
see
me
again
in
an
hour
or
two
if
time
hangs
heavy
get
foolscap
and
pen
and
begin
your
narrative
of
how
we
saved
the
state
felt
some
reflection
of
his
elation
in
my
own
mind
for
knew
well
that
he
would
not
depart
so
far
from
his
usual
austerity
of
demeanour
unless
there
was
good
cause
for
exultation
all
the
long
november
evening
waited
filled
with
impatience
for
his
return
at
last
shortly
after
nine
clock
there
arrived
messenger
with
note
am
dining
at
goldini
restaurant
gloucester
road
kensington
please
come
at
once
and
join
me
there
bring
with
you
jemmy
dark
lantern
chisel
and
revolver
it
was
nice
equipment
for
respectable
citizen
to
carry
through
the
dim
fog
draped
streets
stowed
them
all
discreetly
away
in
my
overcoat
and
drove
straight
to
the
address
given
there
sat
my
friend
at
little
round
table
near
the
door
of
the
garish
italian
restaurant

have
you
had
something
to
eat
then
join
me
in
coffee
and
curacao
try
one
of
the
proprietor
cigars
they
are
less
poisonous
than
one
would
expect
have
you
the
tools
they
are
here
in
my
overcoat
excellent
let
me
give
you
short
sketch
of
what
have
done
with
some
indication
of
what
we
are
about
to
do
now
it
must
be
evident
to
you
watson
that
this
young
man
body
was
placed
on
the
roof
of
the
train
that
was
clear
from
the
instant
that
determined
the
fact
that
it
was
from
the
roof
and
not
from
carriage
that
he
had
fallen
could
it
not
have
been
dropped
from
bridge
should
say
it
was
impossible
if
you
examine
the
roofs
you
will
find
that
they
are
slightly
rounded
and
there
is
no
railing
round
them
therefore
we
can
say
for
certain
that
young
cadogan
west
was
placed
on
it
how
could
he
be
placed
there
that
was
the
question
which
we
had
to
answer
there
is
only
one
possible
way
you
are
aware
that
the
underground
runs
clear
of
tunnels
at
some
points
in
the
west
end
had
vague
memory
that
as
have
travelled
by
it
have
occasionally
seen
windows
just
above
my
head
now
suppose
that
train
halted
under
such
window
would
there
be
any
difficulty
in
laying
body
upon
the
roof
it
seems
most
improbable
we
must
fall
back
upon
the
old
axiom
that
when
all
other
contingencies
fail
whatever
remains
however
improbable
must
be
the
truth
here
all
other
contingencies
have
failed
when
found
that
the
leading
international
agent
who
had
just
left
london
lived
in
row
of
houses
which
abutted
upon
the
underground
was
so
pleased
that
you
were
little
astonished
at
my
sudden
frivolity
oh
that
was
it
was
it
yes
that
was
it
mr
hugo
oberstein
of
13
caulfield
gardens
had
become
my
objective
began
my
operations
at
gloucester
road
station
where
very
helpful
official
walked
with
me
along
the
track
and
allowed
me
to
satisfy
myself
not
only
that
the
back
stair
windows
of
caulfield
gardens
open
on
the
line
but
the
even
more
essential
fact
that
owing
to
the
intersection
of
one
of
the
larger
railways
the
underground
trains
are
frequently
held
motionless
for
some
minutes
at
that
very
spot
splendid
holmes
you
have
got
it
so
far
so
far
watson
we
advance
but
the
goal
is
afar
well
having
seen
the
back
of
caulfield
gardens
visited
the
front
and
satisfied
myself
that
the
bird
was
indeed
flown
it
is
considerable
house
unfurnished
so
far
as
could
judge
in
the
upper
rooms
oberstein
lived
there
with
single
valet
who
was
probably
confederate
entirely
in
his
confidence
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
oberstein
has
gone
to
the
continent
to
dispose
of
his
booty
but
not
with
any
idea
of
flight
for
he
had
no
reason
to
fear
warrant
and
the
idea
of
an
amateur
domiciliary
visit
would
certainly
never
occur
to
him
yet
that
is
precisely
what
we
are
about
to
make
could
we
not
get
warrant
and
legalize
it
hardly
on
the
evidence
what
can
we
hope
to
do
we
cannot
tell
what
correspondence
may
be
there
don
like
it
holmes
my
dear
fellow
you
shall
keep
watch
in
the
street
ll
do
the
criminal
part
it
not
time
to
stick
at
trifles
think
of
mycroft
note
of
the
admiralty
the
cabinet
the
exalted
person
who
waits
for
news
we
are
bound
to
go
my
answer
was
to
rise
from
the
table
you
are
right
holmes
we
are
bound
to
go
he
sprang
up
and
shook
me
by
the
hand
knew
you
would
not
shrink
at
the
last
said
he
and
for
moment
saw
something
in
his
eyes
which
was
nearer
to
tenderness
than
had
ever
seen
the
next
instant
he
was
his
masterful
practical
self
once
more
it
is
nearly
half
mile
but
there
is
no
hurry
let
us
walk
said
he
don
drop
the
instruments
beg
your
arrest
as
suspicious
character
would
be
most
unfortunate
complication
caulfield
gardens
was
one
of
those
lines
of
flat
faced
pillared
and
porticoed
houses
which
are
so
prominent
product
of
the
middle
victorian
epoch
in
the
west
end
of
london
next
door
there
appeared
to
be
children
party
for
the
merry
buzz
of
young
voices
and
the
clatter
of
piano
resounded
through
the
night
the
fog
still
hung
about
and
screened
us
with
its
friendly
shade
holmes
had
lit
his
lantern
and
flashed
it
upon
the
massive
door
this
is
serious
proposition
said
he
it
is
certainly
bolted
as
well
as
locked
we
would
do
better
in
the
area
there
is
an
excellent
archway
down
yonder
in
case
too
zealous
policeman
should
intrude
give
me
hand
watson
and
ll
do
the
same
for
you
minute
later
we
were
both
in
the
area
hardly
had
we
reached
the
dark
shadows
before
the
step
of
the
policeman
was
heard
in
the
fog
above
as
its
soft
rhythm
died
away
holmes
set
to
work
upon
the
lower
door
saw
him
stoop
and
strain
until
with
sharp
crash
it
flew
open
we
sprang
through
into
the
dark
passage
closing
the
area
door
behind
us
holmes
let
the
way
up
the
curving
uncarpeted
stair
his
little
fan
of
yellow
light
shone
upon
low
window
here
we
are
watson
this
must
be
the
one
he
threw
it
open
and
as
he
did
so
there
was
low
harsh
murmur
growing
steadily
into
loud
roar
as
train
dashed
past
us
in
the
darkness
holmes
swept
his
light
along
the
window
sill
it
was
thickly
coated
with
soot
from
the
passing
engines
but
the
black
surface
was
blurred
and
rubbed
in
places
you
can
see
where
they
rested
the
body
halloa
watson
what
is
this
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
is
blood
mark
he
was
pointing
to
faint
discolourations
along
the
woodwork
of
the
window
here
it
is
on
the
stone
of
the
stair
also
the
demonstration
is
complete
let
us
stay
here
until
train
stops
we
had
not
long
to
wait
the
very
next
train
roared
from
the
tunnel
as
before
but
slowed
in
the
open
and
then
with
creaking
of
brakes
pulled
up
immediately
beneath
us
it
was
not
four
feet
from
the
window
ledge
to
the
roof
of
the
carriages
holmes
softly
closed
the
window
so
far
we
are
justified
said
he
what
do
you
think
of
it
watson
masterpiece
you
have
never
risen
to
greater
height
cannot
agree
with
you
there
from
the
moment
that
conceived
the
idea
of
the
body
being
upon
the
roof
which
surely
was
not
very
abstruse
one
all
the
rest
was
inevitable
if
it
were
not
for
the
grave
interests
involved
the
affair
up
to
this
point
would
be
insignificant
our
difficulties
are
still
before
us
but
perhaps
we
may
find
something
here
which
may
help
us
we
had
ascended
the
kitchen
stair
and
entered
the
suite
of
rooms
upon
the
first
floor
one
was
dining
room
severely
furnished
and
containing
nothing
of
interest
second
was
bedroom
which
also
drew
blank
the
remaining
room
appeared
more
promising
and
my
companion
settled
down
to
systematic
examination
it
was
littered
with
books
and
papers
and
was
evidently
used
as
study
swiftly
and
methodically
holmes
turned
over
the
contents
of
drawer
after
drawer
and
cupboard
after
cupboard
but
no
gleam
of
success
came
to
brighten
his
austere
face
at
the
end
of
an
hour
he
was
no
further
than
when
he
started
the
cunning
dog
has
covered
his
tracks
said
he
has
left
nothing
to
incriminate
him
his
dangerous
correspondence
has
been
destroyed
or
removed
this
is
our
last
chance
it
was
small
tin
cash
box
which
stood
upon
the
writing
desk
holmes
pried
it
open
with
his
chisel
several
rolls
of
paper
were
within
covered
with
figures
and
calculations
without
any
note
to
show
to
what
they
referred
the
recurring
words
water
pressure
and
pressure
to
the
square
inch
suggested
some
possible
relation
to
submarine
holmes
tossed
them
all
impatiently
aside
there
only
remained
an
envelope
with
some
small
newspaper
slips
inside
it
he
shook
them
out
on
the
table
and
at
once
saw
by
his
eager
face
that
his
hopes
had
been
raised
what
this
watson
eh
what
this
record
of
series
of
messages
in
the
advertisements
of
paper
daily
telegraph
agony
column
by
the
print
and

right

top
corner
of

no

themselves
this

be
the
first
hoped
to
hear
sooner

agreed
to
write
fully
to

on

pierrot

you

then
comes

withdraw

confirm

pierrot
finally
monday
night
after
nine
two
taps
only
ourselves
do
not
be
so
suspicious
payment
in
hard
cash
when
goods
delivered
pierrot
fairly
complete
record
watson
if
we
could
only
get
at
the
man
at
the
other
end
he
sat
lost
in
thought
tapping
his
fingers
on
the
table
finally
he
sprang
to
his
feet

well
perhaps
it
won
be
so
difficult
after
all
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
here
watson
think
we
might
drive
round
to
the
offices
of
the
daily
telegraph
and
so
bring
good
day
work
to
conclusion
mycroft
holmes
and
lestrade
had
come
round
by
appointment
after
breakfast
next
day
and
sherlock
holmes
had
recounted
to
them
our
proceedings
of
the
day
before
the
professional
shook
his
head
over
our
confessed
burglary
we
can
do
these
things
in
the
force
mr
holmes
said
he
no
wonder
you
get
results
that
are
beyond
us
but
some
of
these
days
you
ll
go
too
far
and
you
ll
find
yourself
and
your
friend
in
trouble
for
england
home
and
beauty
eh
watson
martyrs
on
the
altar
of
our
country
but
what
do
you
think
of
it
mycroft
excellent
sherlock
admirable
but
what
use
will
you
make
of
it
holmes
picked
up
the
daily
telegraph
which
lay
upon
the
table
have
you
seen

what
another

here
it
is
to

place
two

most
vitally
important
your
own
safety
at
stake
pierrot
by
george
cried
lestrade
if
he
answers
that
we
ve
got
him
that
was
my
idea
when
put
it
in
think
if
you
could
both
make
it
convenient
to
come
with
us
about
eight
clock
to
caulfield
gardens
we
might
possibly
get
little
nearer
to
solution
one
of
the
most
remarkable
characteristics
of
sherlock
holmes
was
his
power
of
throwing
his
brain
out
of
action
and
switching
all
his
thoughts
on
to
lighter
things
whenever
he
had
convinced
himself
that
he
could
no
longer
work
to
advantage
remember
that
during
the
whole
of
that
memorable
day
he
lost
himself
in
monograph
which
he
had
undertaken
upon
the
polyphonic
motets
of
lassus
for
my
own
part
had
none
of
this
power
of
detachment
and
the
day
in
consequence
appeared
to
be
interminable
the
great
national
importance
of
the
issue
the
suspense
in
high
quarters
the
direct
nature
of
the
experiment
which
we
were
trying
all
combined
to
work
upon
my
nerve
it
was
relief
to
me
when
at
last
after
light
dinner
we
set
out
upon
our
expedition
lestrade
and
mycroft
met
us
by
appointment
at
the
outside
of
gloucester
road
station
the
area
door
of
oberstein
house
had
been
left
open
the
night
before
and
it
was
necessary
for
me
as
mycroft
holmes
absolutely
and
indignantly
declined
to
climb
the
railings
to
pass
in
and
open
the
hall
door
by
nine
clock
we
were
all
seated
in
the
study
waiting
patently
for
our
man
an
hour
passed
and
yet
another
when
eleven
struck
the
measured
beat
of
the
great
church
clock
seemed
to
sound
the
dirge
of
our
hopes
lestrade
and
mycroft
were
fidgeting
in
their
seats
and
looking
twice
minute
at
their
watches
holmes
sat
silent
and
composed
his
eyelids
half
shut
but
every
sense
on
the
alert
he
raised
his
head
with
sudden
jerk
he
is
coming
said
he
there
had
been
furtive
step
past
the
door
now
it
returned
we
heard
shuffling
sound
outside
and
then
two
sharp
taps
with
the
knocker
holmes
rose
motioning
us
to
remain
seated
the
gas
in
the
hall
was
mere
point
of
light
he
opened
the
outer
door
and
then
as
dark
figure
slipped
past
him
he
closed
and
fastened
it
this
way
we
heard
him
say
and
moment
later
our
man
stood
before
us
holmes
had
followed
him
closely
and
as
the
man
turned
with
cry
of
surprise
and
alarm
he
caught
him
by
the
collar
and
threw
him
back
into
the
room
before
our
prisoner
had
recovered
his
balance
the
door
was
shut
and
holmes
standing
with
his
back
against
it
the
man
glared
round
him
staggered
and
fell
senseless
upon
the
floor
with
the
shock
his
broad
brimmed
hat
flew
from
his
head
his
cravat
slipped
sown
from
his
lips
and
there
were
the
long
light
beard
and
the
soft
handsome
delicate
features
of
colonel
valentine
walter
holmes
gave
whistle
of
surprise
you
can
write
me
down
an
ass
this
time
watson
said
he
this
was
not
the
bird
that
was
looking
for
who
is
he
asked
mycroft
eagerly
the
younger
brother
of
the
late
sir
james
walter
the
head
of
the
submarine
department
yes
see
the
fall
of
the
cards
he
is
coming
to
think
that
you
had
best
leave
his
examination
to
me
we
had
carried
the
prostrate
body
to
the
sofa
now
our
prisoner
sat
up
looked
round
him
with
horror
stricken
face
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
like
one
who
cannot
believe
his
own
senses
what
is
this
he
asked
came
here
to
visit
mr
oberstein
everything
is
known
colonel
walter
said
holmes
how
an
english
gentleman
could
behave
in
such
manner
is
beyond
my
comprehension
but
your
whole
correspondence
and
relations
with
oberstein
are
within
our
knowledge
so
also
are
the
circumstances
connected
with
the
death
of
young
cadogan
west
let
me
advise
you
to
gain
at
least
the
small
credit
for
repentance
and
confession
since
there
are
still
some
details
which
we
can
only
learn
from
your
lips
the
man
groaned
and
sank
his
face
in
his
hands
we
waited
but
he
was
silent
can
assure
you
said
holmes
that
every
essential
is
already
known
we
know
that
you
were
pressed
for
money
that
you
took
an
impress
of
the
keys
which
your
brother
held
and
that
you
entered
into
correspondence
with
oberstein
who
answered
your
letters
through
the
advertisement
columns
of
the
daily
telegraph
we
are
aware
that
you
went
down
to
the
office
in
the
fog
on
monday
night
but
that
you
were
seen
and
followed
by
young
cadogan
west
who
had
probably
some
previous
reason
to
suspect
you
he
saw
your
theft
but
could
not
give
the
alarm
as
it
was
just
possible
that
you
were
taking
the
papers
to
your
brother
in
london
leaving
all
his
private
concerns
like
the
good
citizen
that
he
was
he
followed
you
closely
in
the
fog
and
kept
at
your
heels
until
you
reached
this
very
house
there
he
intervened
and
then
it
was
colonel
walter
that
to
treason
you
added
the
more
terrible
crime
of
murder
did
not
did
not
before
god
swear
that
did
not
cried
our
wretched
prisoner
tell
us
then
how
cadogan
west
met
his
end
before
you
laid
him
upon
the
roof
of
railway
carriage
will
swear
to
you
that
will
did
the
rest
confess
it
was
just
as
you
say
stock
exchange
debt
had
to
be
paid
needed
the
money
badly
oberstein
offered
me
five
thousand
it
was
to
save
myself
from
ruin
but
as
to
murder
am
as
innocent
as
you
what
happened
then
he
had
his
suspicions
before
and
he
followed
me
as
you
describe
never
knew
it
until
was
at
the
very
door
it
was
thick
fog
and
one
could
not
see
three
yards
had
given
two
taps
and
oberstein
had
come
to
the
door
the
young
man
rushed
up
and
demanded
to
know
what
we
were
about
to
do
with
the
papers
oberstein
had
short
life
preserver
he
always
carried
it
with
him
as
west
forced
his
way
after
us
into
the
house
oberstein
struck
him
on
the
head
the
blow
was
fatal
one
he
was
dead
within
five
minutes
there
he
lay
in
the
hall
and
we
were
at
our
wit
end
what
to
do
then
oberstein
had
this
idea
about
the
trains
which
halted
under
his
back
window
but
first
he
examined
the
papers
which
had
brought
he
said
that
three
of
them
were
essential
and
that
he
must
keep
them
you
cannot
keep
them
said
there
will
be
dreadful
row
at
woolwich
if
they
are
not
returned
must
keep
them
said
he
for
they
are
so
technical
that
it
is
impossible
in
the
time
to
make
copies
then
they
must
all
go
back
together
to
night
said
he
thought
for
little
and
then
he
cried
out
that
he
had
it
three
will
keep
said
he
the
others
we
will
stuff
into
the
pocket
of
this
young
man
when
he
is
found
the
whole
business
will
assuredly
be
put
to
his
account
could
see
no
other
way
out
of
it
so
we
did
as
he
suggested
we
waited
half
an
hour
at
the
window
before
train
stopped
it
was
so
thick
that
nothing
could
be
seen
and
we
had
no
difficulty
in
lowering
west
body
on
to
the
train
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter
so
far
as
was
concerned
and
your
brother
he
said
nothing
but
he
had
caught
me
once
with
his
keys
and
think
that
he
suspected
read
in
his
eyes
that
he
suspected
as
you
know
he
never
held
up
his
head
again
there
was
silence
in
the
room
it
was
broken
by
mycroft
holmes
can
you
not
make
reparation
it
would
ease
your
conscience
and
possibly
your
punishment
what
reparation
can
make
where
is
oberstein
with
the
papers
do
not
know
did
he
give
you
no
address
he
said
that
letters
to
the
hotel
du
louvre
paris
would
eventually
reach
him
then
reparation
is
still
within
your
power
said
sherlock
holmes
will
do
anything
can
owe
this
fellow
no
particular
goodwill
he
has
been
my
ruin
and
my
downfall
here
are
paper
and
pen
sit
at
this
desk
and
write
to
my
dictation
direct
the
envelope
to
the
address
given
that
is
right
now
the
letter

dear
sir
with
regard
to
our
transaction
you
will
no
doubt
have
observed
by
now
that
one
essential
detail
is
missing
have
tracing
which
will
make
it
complete
this
has
involved
me
in
extra
trouble
however
and
must
ask
you
for
further
advance
of
five
hundred
pounds
will
not
trust
it
to
the
post
nor
will
take
anything
but
gold
or
notes
would
come
to
you
abroad
but
it
would
excite
remark
if
left
the
country
at
present
therefore
shall
expect
to
meet
you
in
the
smoking
room
of
the
charing
cross
hotel
at
noon
on
saturday
remember
that
only
english
notes
or
gold
will
be
taken
that
will
do
very
well
shall
be
very
much
surprised
if
it
does
not
fetch
our
man
and
it
did
it
is
matter
of
history
that
secret
history
of
nation
which
is
often
so
much
more
intimate
and
interesting
than
its
public
chronicles
that
oberstein
eager
to
complete
the
coup
of
his
lifetime
came
to
the
lure
and
was
safely
engulfed
for
fifteen
years
in
british
prison
in
his
trunk
were
found
the
invaluable
bruce
partington
plans
which
he
had
put
up
for
auction
in
all
the
naval
centres
of
europe
colonel
walter
died
in
prison
towards
the
end
of
the
second
year
of
his
sentence
as
to
holmes
he
returned
refreshed
to
his
monograph
upon
the
polyphonic
motets
of
lassus
which
has
since
been
printed
for
private
circulation
and
is
said
by
experts
to
be
the
last
word
upon
the
subject
some
weeks
afterwards
learned
incidentally
that
my
friend
spent
day
at
windsor
whence
be
returned
with
remarkably
fine
emerald
tie
pin
when
asked
him
if
he
had
bought
it
he
answered
that
it
was
present
from
certain
gracious
lady
in
whose
interests
he
had
once
been
fortunate
enough
to
carry
out
small
commission
he
said
no
more
but
fancy
that
could
guess
at
that
lady
august
name
and
have
little
doubt
that
the
emerald
pin
will
forever
recall
to
my
friend
memory
the
adventure
of
the
bruce
partington
plans
iv
the
adventure
of
the
devil
foot
in
recording
from
time
to
time
some
of
the
curious
experiences
and
interesting
recollections
which
associate
with
my
long
and
intimate
friendship
with
mr
sherlock
holmes
have
continually
been
faced
by
difficulties
caused
by
his
own
aversion
to
publicity
to
his
sombre
and
cynical
spirit
all
popular
applause
was
always
abhorrent
and
nothing
amused
him
more
at
the
end
of
successful
case
than
to
hand
over
the
actual
exposure
to
some
orthodox
official
and
to
listen
with
mocking
smile
to
the
general
chorus
of
misplaced
congratulation
it
was
indeed
this
attitude
upon
the
part
of
my
friend
and
certainly
not
any
lack
of
interesting
material
which
has
caused
me
of
late
years
to
lay
very
few
of
my
records
before
the
public
my
participation
in
some
if
his
adventures
was
always
privilege
which
entailed
discretion
and
reticence
upon
me
it
was
then
with
considerable
surprise
that
received
telegram
from
homes
last
tuesday
he
has
never
been
known
to
write
where
telegram
would
serve
in
the
following
terms
why
not
tell
them
of
the
cornish
horror
strangest
case
have
handled
have
no
idea
what
backward
sweep
of
memory
had
brought
the
matter
fresh
to
his
mind
or
what
freak
had
caused
him
to
desire
that
should
recount
it
but
hasten
before
another
cancelling
telegram
may
arrive
to
hunt
out
the
notes
which
give
me
the
exact
details
of
the
case
and
to
lay
the
narrative
before
my
readers
it
was
then
in
the
spring
of
the
year
1897
that
holmes
iron
constitution
showed
some
symptoms
of
giving
way
in
the
face
of
constant
hard
work
of
most
exacting
kind
aggravated
perhaps
by
occasional
indiscretions
of
his
own
in
march
of
that
year
dr
moore
agar
of
harley
street
whose
dramatic
introduction
to
holmes
may
some
day
recount
gave
positive
injunctions
that
the
famous
private
agent
lay
aside
all
his
cases
and
surrender
himself
to
complete
rest
if
he
wished
to
avert
an
absolute
breakdown
the
state
of
his
health
was
not
matter
in
which
he
himself
took
the
faintest
interest
for
his
mental
detachment
was
absolute
but
he
was
induced
at
last
on
the
threat
of
being
permanently
disqualified
from
work
to
give
himself
complete
change
of
scene
and
air
thus
it
was
that
in
the
early
spring
of
that
year
we
found
ourselves
together
in
small
cottage
near
poldhu
bay
at
the
further
extremity
of
the
cornish
peninsula
it
was
singular
spot
and
one
peculiarly
well
suited
to
the
grim
humour
of
my
patient
from
the
windows
of
our
little
whitewashed
house
which
stood
high
upon
grassy
headland
we
looked
down
upon
the
whole
sinister
semicircle
of
mounts
bay
that
old
death
trap
of
sailing
vessels
with
its
fringe
of
black
cliffs
and
surge
swept
reefs
on
which
innumerable
seamen
have
met
their
end
with
northerly
breeze
it
lies
placid
and
sheltered
inviting
the
storm
tossed
craft
to
tack
into
it
for
rest
and
protection
then
come
the
sudden
swirl
round
of
the
wind
the
blistering
gale
from
the
south
west
the
dragging
anchor
the
lee
shore
and
the
last
battle
in
the
creaming
breakers
the
wise
mariner
stands
far
out
from
that
evil
place
on
the
land
side
our
surroundings
were
as
sombre
as
on
the
sea
it
was
country
of
rolling
moors
lonely
and
dun
coloured
with
an
occasional
church
tower
to
mark
the
site
of
some
old
world
village
in
every
direction
upon
these
moors
there
were
traces
of
some
vanished
race
which
had
passed
utterly
away
and
left
as
it
sole
record
strange
monuments
of
stone
irregular
mounds
which
contained
the
burned
ashes
of
the
dead
and
curious
earthworks
which
hinted
at
prehistoric
strife
the
glamour
and
mystery
of
the
place
with
its
sinister
atmosphere
of
forgotten
nations
appealed
to
the
imagination
of
my
friend
and
he
spent
much
of
his
time
in
long
walks
and
solitary
meditations
upon
the
moor
the
ancient
cornish
language
had
also
arrested
his
attention
and
he
had
remember
conceived
the
idea
that
it
was
akin
to
the
chaldean
and
had
been
largely
derived
from
the
phoenician
traders
in
tin
he
had
received
consignment
of
books
upon
philology
and
was
settling
down
to
develop
this
thesis
when
suddenly
to
my
sorrow
and
to
his
unfeigned
delight
we
found
ourselves
even
in
that
land
of
dreams
plunged
into
problem
at
our
very
doors
which
was
more
intense
more
engrossing
and
infinitely
more
mysterious
than
any
of
those
which
had
driven
us
from
london
our
simple
life
and
peaceful
healthy
routine
were
violently
interrupted
and
we
were
precipitated
into
the
midst
of
series
of
events
which
caused
the
utmost
excitement
not
only
in
cornwall
but
throughout
the
whole
west
of
england
many
of
my
readers
may
retain
some
recollection
of
what
was
called
at
the
time
the
cornish
horror
though
most
imperfect
account
of
the
matter
reached
the
london
press
now
after
thirteen
years
will
give
the
true
details
of
this
inconceivable
affair
to
the
public
have
said
that
scattered
towers
marked
the
villages
which
dotted
this
part
of
cornwall
the
nearest
of
these
was
the
hamlet
of
tredannick
wollas
where
the
cottages
of
couple
of
hundred
inhabitants
clustered
round
an
ancient
moss
grown
church
the
vicar
of
the
parish
mr
roundhay
was
something
of
an
archaeologist
and
as
such
holmes
had
made
his
acquaintance
he
was
middle
aged
man
portly
and
affable
with
considerable
fund
of
local
lore
at
his
invitation
we
had
taken
tea
at
the
vicarage
and
had
come
to
know
also
mr
mortimer
tregennis
an
independent
gentleman
who
increased
the
clergyman
scanty
resources
by
taking
rooms
in
his
large
straggling
house
the
vicar
being
bachelor
was
glad
to
come
to
such
an
arrangement
though
he
had
little
in
common
with
his
lodger
who
was
thin
dark
spectacled
man
with
stoop
which
gave
the
impression
of
actual
physical
deformity
remember
that
during
our
short
visit
we
found
the
vicar
garrulous
but
his
lodger
strangely
reticent
sad
faced
introspective
man
sitting
with
averted
eyes
brooding
apparently
upon
his
own
affairs
these
were
the
two
men
who
entered
abruptly
into
our
little
sitting
room
on
tuesday
march
the
16th
shortly
after
our
breakfast
hour
as
we
were
smoking
together
preparatory
to
our
daily
excursion
upon
the
moors
mr
holmes
said
the
vicar
in
an
agitated
voice
the
most
extraordinary
and
tragic
affair
has
occurred
during
the
night
it
is
the
most
unheard
of
business
we
can
only
regard
it
as
special
providence
that
you
should
chance
to
be
here
at
the
time
for
in
all
england
you
are
the
one
man
we
need
glared
at
the
intrusive
vicar
with
no
very
friendly
eyes
but
holmes
took
his
pipe
from
his
lips
and
sat
up
in
his
chair
like
an
old
hound
who
hears
the
view
halloa
he
waved
his
hand
to
the
sofa
and
our
palpitating
visitor
with
his
agitated
companion
sat
side
by
side
upon
it
mr
mortimer
tregennis
was
more
selfcontained
than
the
clergyman
but
the
twitching
of
his
thin
hands
and
the
brightness
of
his
dark
eyes
showed
that
they
shared
common
emotion

shall
speak
or
you
he
asked
of
the
vicar
well
as
you
seem
to
have
made
the
discovery
whatever
it
may
be
and
the
vicar
to
have
had
it
second
hand
perhaps
you
had
better
do
the
speaking
said
holmes
glanced
at
the
hastily
clad
clergyman
with
the
formally
dressed
lodger
seated
beside
him
and
was
amused
at
the
surprise
which
holmes
simple
deduction
had
brought
to
their
faces
perhaps
had
best
say
few
words
first
said
the
vicar
and
then
you
can
judge
if
you
will
listen
to
the
details
from
mr
tregennis
or
whether
we
should
not
hasten
at
once
to
the
scene
of
this
mysterious
affair
may
explain
then
that
our
friend
here
spent
last
evening
in
the
company
of
his
two
brothers
owen
and
george
and
of
his
sister
brenda
at
their
house
of
tredannick
wartha
which
is
near
the
old
stone
cross
upon
the
moor
he
left
them
shortly
after
ten
clock
playing
cards
round
the
dining
room
table
in
excellent
health
and
spirits
this
morning
being
an
early
riser
he
walked
in
that
direction
before
breakfast
and
was
overtaken
by
the
carriage
of
dr
richards
who
explained
that
he
had
just
been
sent
for
on
most
urgent
call
to
tredannick
wartha
mr
mortimer
tregennis
naturally
went
with
him
when
he
arrived
at
tredannick
wartha
he
found
an
extraordinary
state
of
things
his
two
brothers
and
his
sister
were
seated
round
the
table
exactly
as
he
had
left
them
the
cards
still
spread
in
front
of
them
and
the
candles
burned
down
to
their
sockets
the
sister
lay
back
stone
dead
in
her
chair
while
the
two
brothers
sat
on
each
side
of
her
laughing
shouting
and
singing
the
senses
stricken
clean
out
of
them
all
three
of
them
the
dead
woman
and
the
two
demented
men
retained
upon
their
faces
an
expression
of
the
utmost
horror
convulsion
of
terror
which
was
dreadful
to
look
upon
there
was
no
sign
of
the
presence
of
anyone
in
the
house
except
mrs
porter
the
old
cook
and
housekeeper
who
declared
that
she
had
slept
deeply
and
heard
no
sound
during
the
night
nothing
had
been
stolen
or
disarranged
and
there
is
absolutely
no
explanation
of
what
the
horror
can
be
which
has
frightened
woman
to
death
and
two
strong
men
out
of
their
senses
there
is
the
situation
mr
holmes
in
nutshell
and
if
you
can
help
us
to
clear
it
up
you
will
have
done
great
work
had
hoped
that
in
some
way
could
coax
my
companion
back
into
the
quiet
which
had
been
the
object
of
our
journey
but
one
glance
at
his
intense
face
and
contracted
eyebrows
told
me
how
vain
was
now
the
expectation
he
sat
for
some
little
time
in
silence
absorbed
in
the
strange
drama
which
had
broken
in
upon
our
peace
will
look
into
this
matter
he
said
at
last
on
the
face
of
it
would
appear
to
be
case
of
very
exceptional
nature
have
you
been
there
yourself
mr
roundhay
no
mr
holmes
mr
tregennis
brought
back
the
account
to
the
vicarage
and
at
once
hurried
over
with
him
to
consult
you
how
far
is
it
to
the
house
where
this
singular
tragedy
occurred
about
mile
inland
then
we
shall
walk
over
together
but
before
we
start
must
ask
you
few
question
mr
mortimer
tregennis
the
other
had
been
silent
all
this
time
but
had
observed
that
his
more
controlled
excitement
was
even
greater
than
the
obtrusive
emotion
of
the
clergyman
he
sat
with
pale
drawn
face
his
anxious
gaze
fixed
upon
holmes
and
his
thin
hands
clasped
convulsively
together
his
pale
lips
quivered
as
he
listened
to
the
dreadful
experience
which
had
befallen
his
family
and
his
dark
eyes
seemed
to
reflect
something
of
the
horror
of
the
scene
ask
what
you
like
mr
holmes
said
he
eagerly
it
is
bad
thing
to
speak
of
but
will
answer
you
the
truth
tell
me
about
last
night
well
mr
holmes
supped
there
as
the
vicar
has
said
and
my
elder
brother
george
proposed
game
of
whist
afterwards
we
sat
down
about
nine
clock
it
was
quarter
past
ten
when
moved
to
go
left
them
all
round
the
table
as
merry
as
could
be
who
let
you
out
mrs
porter
had
gone
to
bed
so
let
myself
out
shut
the
hall
door
behind
me
the
window
of
the
room
in
which
they
sat
was
closed
but
the
blind
was
not
drawn
down
there
was
no
change
in
door
or
window
this
morning
or
any
reason
to
think
that
any
stranger
had
been
to
the
house
yet
there
they
sat
driven
clean
mad
with
terror
and
brenda
lying
dead
of
fright
with
her
head
hanging
over
the
arm
of
the
chair
ll
never
get
the
sight
of
that
room
out
of
my
mind
so
long
as
live
the
facts
as
you
state
them
are
certainly
most
remarkable
said
holmes
take
it
that
you
have
no
theory
yourself
which
can
in
any
way
account
for
them
it
devilish
mr
holmes
devilish
cried
mortimer
tregennis
it
is
not
of
this
world
something
has
come
into
that
room
which
has
dashed
the
light
of
reason
from
their
minds
what
human
contrivance
could
do
that
fear
said
holmes
that
if
the
matter
is
beyond
humanity
it
is
certainly
beyond
me
yet
we
must
exhaust
all
natural
explanations
before
we
fall
back
upon
such
theory
as
this
as
to
yourself
mr
tregennis
take
it
you
were
divided
in
some
way
from
your
family
since
they
lived
together
and
you
had
rooms
apart
that
is
so
mr
holmes
though
the
matter
is
past
and
done
with
we
were
family
of
tin
miners
at
redruth
but
we
sold
our
venture
to
company
and
so
retired
with
enough
to
keep
us
won
deny
that
there
was
some
feeling
about
the
division
of
the
money
and
it
stood
between
us
for
time
but
it
was
all
forgiven
and
forgotten
and
we
were
the
best
of
friends
together
looking
back
at
the
evening
which
you
spent
together
does
anything
stand
out
in
your
memory
as
throwing
any
possible
light
upon
the
tragedy
think
carefully
mr
tregennis
for
any
clue
which
can
help
me
there
is
nothing
at
all
sir
your
people
were
in
their
usual
spirits
never
better
were
they
nervous
people
did
they
ever
show
any
apprehension
of
coming
danger
nothing
of
the
kind
you
have
nothing
to
add
then
which
could
assist
me
mortimer
tregennis
considered
earnestly
for
moment
there
is
one
thing
occurs
to
me
said
he
at
last
as
we
sat
at
the
table
my
back
was
to
the
window
and
my
brother
george
he
being
my
partner
at
cards
was
facing
it
saw
him
once
look
hard
over
my
shoulder
so
turned
round
and
looked
also
the
blind
was
up
and
the
window
shut
but
could
just
make
out
the
bushes
on
the
lawn
and
it
seemed
to
me
for
moment
that
saw
something
moving
among
them
couldn
even
say
if
it
was
man
or
animal
but
just
thought
there
was
something
there
when
asked
him
what
he
was
looking
at
he
told
me
that
he
had
the
same
feeling
that
is
all
that
can
say
did
you
not
investigate
no
the
matter
passed
as
unimportant
you
left
them
then
without
any
premonition
of
evil
none
at
all
am
not
clear
how
you
came
to
hear
the
news
so
early
this
morning
am
an
early
riser
and
generally
take
walk
before
breakfast
this
morning
had
hardly
started
when
the
doctor
in
his
carriage
overtook
me
he
told
me
that
old
mrs
porter
had
sent
boy
down
with
an
urgent
message
sprang
in
beside
him
and
we
drove
on
when
we
got
there
we
looked
into
that
dreadful
room
the
candles
and
the
fire
must
have
burned
out
hours
before
and
they
had
been
sitting
there
in
the
dark
until
dawn
had
broken
the
doctor
said
brenda
must
have
been
dead
at
least
six
hours
there
were
no
signs
of
violence
she
just
lay
across
the
arm
of
the
chair
with
that
look
on
her
face
george
and
owen
were
singing
snatches
of
songs
and
gibbering
like
two
great
apes
oh
it
was
awful
to
see
couldn
stand
it
and
the
doctor
was
as
white
as
sheet
indeed
he
fell
into
chair
in
sort
of
faint
and
we
nearly
had
him
on
our
hands
as
well
remarkable
most
remarkable
said
holmes
rising
and
taking
his
hat
think
perhaps
we
had
better
go
down
to
tredannick
wartha
without
further
delay
confess
that
have
seldom
known
case
which
at
first
sight
presented
more
singular
problem
our
proceedings
of
that
first
morning
did
little
to
advance
the
investigation
it
was
marked
however
at
the
outset
by
an
incident
which
left
the
most
sinister
impression
upon
my
mind
the
approach
to
the
spot
at
which
the
tragedy
occurred
is
down
narrow
winding
country
lane
while
we
made
our
way
along
it
we
heard
the
rattle
of
carriage
coming
towards
us
and
stood
aside
to
let
it
pass
as
it
drove
by
us
caught
glimpse
through
the
closed
window
of
horribly
contorted
grinning
face
glaring
out
at
us
those
staring
eyes
and
gnashing
teeth
flashed
past
us
like
dreadful
vision
my
brothers
cried
mortimer
tregennis
white
to
his
lips
they
are
taking
them
to
helston
we
looked
with
horror
after
the
black
carriage
lumbering
upon
its
way
then
we
turned
our
steps
towards
this
ill
omened
house
in
which
they
had
met
their
strange
fate

it
was
large
and
bright
dwelling
rather
villa
than
cottage
with
considerable
garden
which
was
already
in
that
cornish
air
well
filled
with
spring
flowers
towards
this
garden
the
window
of
the
sitting
room
fronted
and
from
it
according
to
mortimer
tregennis
must
have
come
that
thing
of
evil
which
had
by
sheer
horror
in
single
instant
blasted
their
minds
holmes
walked
slowly
and
thoughtfully
among
the
flowerplots
and
along
the
path
before
we
entered
the
porch
so
absorbed
was
he
in
his
thoughts
remember
that
he
stumbled
over
the
watering
pot
upset
its
contents
and
deluged
both
our
feet
and
the
garden
path
inside
the
house
we
were
met
by
the
elderly
cornish
housekeeper
mrs
porter
who
with
the
aid
of
young
girl
looked
after
the
wants
of
the
family
she
readily
answered
all
holmes
questions
she
had
heard
nothing
in
the
night
her
employers
had
all
been
in
excellent
spirits
lately
and
she
had
never
known
them
more
cheerful
and
prosperous
she
had
fainted
with
horror
upon
entering
the
room
in
the
morning
and
seeing
that
dreadful
company
round
the
table
she
had
when
she
recovered
thrown
open
the
window
to
let
the
morning
air
in
and
had
run
down
to
the
lane
whence
she
sent
farm
lad
for
the
doctor
the
lady
was
on
her
bed
upstairs
if
we
cared
to
see
her
it
took
four
strong
men
to
get
the
brothers
into
the
asylum
carriage
she
would
not
herself
stay
in
the
house
another
day
and
was
starting
that
very
afternoon
to
rejoin
her
family
at
st
ives
we
ascended
the
stairs
and
viewed
the
body
miss
brenda
tregennis
had
been
very
beautiful
girl
though
now
verging
upon
middle
age
her
dark
clear
cut
face
was
handsome
even
in
death
but
there
still
lingered
upon
it
something
of
that
convulsion
of
horror
which
had
been
her
last
human
emotion
from
her
bedroom
we
descended
to
the
sitting
room
where
this
strange
tragedy
had
actually
occurred
the
charred
ashes
of
the
overnight
fire
lay
in
the
grate
on
the
table
were
the
four
guttered
and
burned
out
candles
with
the
cards
scattered
over
its
surface
the
chairs
had
been
moved
back
against
the
walls
but
all
else
was
as
it
had
been
the
night
before
holmes
paced
with
light
swift
steps
about
the
room
he
sat
in
the
various
chairs
drawing
them
up
and
reconstructing
their
positions
he
tested
how
much
of
the
garden
was
visible
he
examined
the
floor
the
ceiling
and
the
fireplace
but
never
once
did
see
that
sudden
brightening
of
his
eyes
and
tightening
of
his
lips
which
would
have
told
me
that
he
saw
some
gleam
of
light
in
this
utter
darkness
why
fire
he
asked
once
had
they
always
fire
in
this
small
room
on
spring
evening
mortimer
tregennis
explained
that
the
night
was
cold
and
damp
for
that
reason
after
his
arrival
the
fire
was
lit
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
mr
holmes
he
asked
my
friend
smiled
and
laid
his
hand
upon
my
arm
think
watson
that
shall
resume
that
course
of
tobacco
poisoning
which
you
have
so
often
and
so
justly
condemned
said
he
with
your
permission
gentlemen
we
will
now
return
to
our
cottage
for
am
not
aware
that
any
new
factor
is
likely
to
come
to
our
notice
here
will
turn
the
facts
over
in
my
mid
mr
tregennis
and
should
anything
occur
to
me
will
certainly
ommunicate
with
you
and
the
vicar
in
the
meantime
wish
you
both
good
morning
it
was
not
until
long
after
we
were
back
in
poldhu
cottage
that
holmes
broke
his
complete
and
absorbed
silence
he
sat
coiled
in
his
armchair
his
haggard
and
ascetic
face
hardly
visible
amid
the
blue
swirl
of
his
tobacco
smoke
his
black
brows
drawn
down
his
forehead
contracted
his
eyes
vacant
and
far
away
finally
he
laid
down
his
pipe
and
sprang
to
his
feet
it
won
do
watson
said
he
with
laugh
let
us
walk
along
the
cliffs
together
and
search
for
flint
arrows
we
are
more
likely
to
find
them
than
clues
to
this
problem
to
let
the
brain
work
without
sufficient
material
is
like
racing
an
engine
it
racks
itself
to
pieces
the
sea
air
sunshine
and
patience
watson
all
else
will
come
now
let
us
calmly
define
our
position
watson
he
continued
as
we
skirted
the
cliffs
together
let
us
get
firm
grip
of
the
very
little
which
we
do
know
so
that
when
fresh
facts
arise
we
may
be
ready
to
fit
them
into
their
places
take
it
in
the
first
place
that
neither
of
us
is
prepared
to
admit
diabolical
intrusions
into
the
affairs
of
men
let
us
begin
by
ruling
that
entirely
out
of
our
minds
very
good
there
remain
three
persons
who
have
been
grievously
stricken
by
some
conscious
or
unconscious
human
agency
that
is
firm
ground
now
when
did
this
occur
evidently
assuming
his
narrative
to
be
true
it
was
immediately
after
mr
mortimer
tregennis
had
left
the
room
that
is
very
important
point
the
presumption
is
that
it
was
within
few
minutes
afterwards
the
cards
still
lay
upon
the
table
it
was
already
past
their
usual
hour
for
bed
yet
they
had
not
changed
their
position
or
pushed
back
their
chairs
repeat
then
that
the
occurrence
was
immediately
after
his
departure
and
not
later
than
eleven
clock
last
night
our
next
obvious
step
is
to
check
so
far
as
we
can
the
movements
of
mortimer
tregennis
after
he
left
the
room
in
this
there
is
no
difficulty
and
they
seem
to
be
above
suspicion
knowing
my
methods
as
you
do
you
were
of
course
conscious
of
the
somewhat
clumsy
water
pot
expedient
by
which
obtained
clearer
impress
of
his
foot
than
might
otherwise
have
been
possible
the
wet
sandy
path
took
it
admirably
last
night
was
also
wet
you
will
remember
and
it
was
not
difficult
having
obtained
sample
print
to
pick
out
his
track
among
others
and
to
follow
his
movements
he
appears
to
have
walked
away
swiftly
in
the
direction
of
the
vicarage
if
then
mortimer
tregennis
disappeared
from
the
scene
and
yet
some
outside
person
affected
the
card
players
how
can
we
reconstruct
that
person
and
how
was
such
an
impression
of
horror
conveyed
mrs
porter
may
be
eliminated
she
is
evidently
harmless
is
there
any
evidence
that
someone
crept
up
to
the
garden
window
and
in
some
manner
produced
so
terrific
an
effect
that
he
drove
those
who
saw
it
out
of
their
senses
the
only
suggestion
in
this
direction
comes
from
mortimer
tregennis
himself
who
says
that
his
brother
spoke
about
some
movement
in
the
garden
that
is
certainly
remarkable
as
the
night
was
rainy
cloudy
and
dark
anyone
who
had
the
design
to
alarm
these
people
would
be
compelled
to
place
his
very
face
against
the
glass
before
he
could
be
seen
there
is
three
foot
flowerborder
outside
this
window
but
no
indication
of
footmark
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
then
how
an
outsider
could
have
made
so
terrible
an
impression
upon
the
company
nor
have
we
found
any
possible
motive
for
so
strange
and
elaborate
an
attempt
you
perceive
our
difficulties
watson
they
are
only
too
clear
answered
with
conviction
and
yet
with
little
more
material
we
may
prove
that
they
are
not
insurmountable
said
holmes
fancy
that
among
your
extensive
archives
watson
you
may
find
some
which
were
nearly
as
obscure
meanwhile
we
shall
put
the
case
aside
until
more
accurate
data
are
available
and
devote
the
rest
of
our
morning
to
the
pursuit
of
neolithic
man
may
have
commented
upon
my
friend
power
of
mental
detachment
but
never
have
wondered
at
it
more
than
upon
that
spring
morning
in
cornwall
when
for
two
hours
he
discoursed
upon
celts
arrowheads
and
shards
as
lightly
as
if
no
sinister
mystery
were
waiting
for
his
solution
it
was
not
until
we
had
returned
in
the
afternoon
to
our
cottage
that
we
found
visitor
awaiting
us
who
soon
brought
our
minds
back
to
the
matter
in
hand
neither
of
us
needed
to
be
told
who
that
visitor
was
the
huge
body
the
craggy
and
deeply
seamed
face
with
the
fierce
eyes
and
hawk
like
nose
the
grizzled
hair
which
nearly
brushed
our
cottage
ceiling
the
beard
golden
at
the
fringes
and
white
near
the
lips
save
for
the
nicotine
stain
from
his
perpetual
cigar
all
these
were
as
well
known
in
london
as
in
africa
and
could
only
be
associated
with
the
tremendous
personality
of
dr
leon
sterndale
the
great
lion
hunter
and
explorer
we
had
heard
of
his
presence
in
the
district
and
had
once
or
twice
caught
sight
of
his
tall
figure
upon
the
moorland
paths
he
made
no
advances
to
us
however
nor
would
we
have
dreamed
of
doing
so
to
him
as
it
was
well
known
that
it
was
his
love
of
seclusion
which
caused
him
to
spend
the
greater
part
of
the
intervals
between
his
journeys
in
small
bungalow
buried
in
the
lonely
wood
of
beauchamp
arriance
here
amid
his
books
and
his
maps
he
lived
an
absolutely
lonely
life
attending
to
his
own
simple
wants
and
paying
little
apparent
heed
to
the
affairs
of
his
neighbours
it
was
surprise
to
me
therefore
to
hear
him
asking
holmes
in
an
eager
voice
whether
he
had
made
any
advance
in
his
reconstruction
of
this
mysterious
episode
the
county
police
are
utterly
at
fault
said
he
but
perhaps
your
wider
experience
has
suggested
some
conceivable
explanation
my
only
claim
to
being
taken
into
your
confidence
is
that
during
my
many
residences
here
have
come
to
know
this
family
of
tregennis
very
well
indeed
upon
my
cornish
mother
side
could
call
them
cousins
and
their
strange
fate
has
naturally
been
great
shock
to
me
may
tell
you
that
had
got
as
far
as
plymouth
upon
my
way
to
africa
but
the
news
reached
me
this
morning
and
came
straight
back
again
to
help
in
the
inquiry

holmes
raised
his
eyebrows
did
you
lose
your
boat
through
it
will
take
the
next
dear
me
that
is
friendship
indeed
tell
you
they
were
relatives
quite
so
cousins
of
your
mother
was
your
baggage
aboard
the
ship
some
of
it
but
the
main
part
at
the
hotel
see
but
surely
this
event
could
not
have
found
its
way
into
the
plymouth
morning
papers
no
sir
had
telegram
might
ask
from
whom
shadow
passed
over
the
gaunt
face
of
the
explorer
you
are
very
inquisitive
mr
holmes
it
is
my
business
with
an
effort
dr
sterndale
recovered
his
ruffled
composure
have
no
objection
to
telling
you
he
said
it
was
mr
roundhay
the
vicar
who
sent
me
the
telegram
which
recalled
me
thank
you
said
holmes
may
say
in
answer
to
your
original
question
that
have
not
cleared
my
mind
entirely
on
the
subject
of
this
case
but
that
have
every
hope
of
reaching
some
conclusion
it
would
be
premature
to
say
more
perhaps
you
would
not
mind
telling
me
if
your
suspicions
point
in
any
particular
direction
no
can
hardly
answer
that
then
have
wasted
my
time
and
need
not
prolong
my
visit
the
famous
doctor
strode
out
of
our
cottage
in
considerable
illhumour
and
within
five
minutes
holmes
had
followed
him
saw
him
no
more
until
the
evening
when
he
returned
with
slow
step
and
haggard
face
which
assured
me
that
he
had
made
no
great
progress
with
his
investigation
he
glanced
at
telegram
which
awaited
him
and
threw
it
into
the
grate
from
the
plymouth
hotel
watson
he
said
learned
the
name
of
it
from
the
vicar
and
wired
to
make
certain
that
dr
leon
sterndale
account
was
true
it
appears
that
he
did
indeed
spend
last
night
there
and
that
he
has
actually
allowed
some
of
his
baggage
to
go
on
to
africa
while
he
returned
to
be
present
at
this
investigation
what
do
you
make
of
that
watson
he
is
deeply
interested
deeply
interested
yes
there
is
thread
here
which
we
had
not
yet
grasped
and
which
might
lead
us
through
the
tangle
cheer
up
watson
for
am
very
sure
that
our
material
has
not
yet
all
come
to
hand
when
it
does
we
may
soon
leave
our
difficulties
behind
us
little
did
think
how
soon
the
words
of
holmes
would
be
realized
or
how
strange
and
sinister
would
be
that
new
development
which
opened
up
an
entirely
fresh
line
of
investigation
was
shaving
at
my
window
in
the
morning
when
heard
the
rattle
of
hoofs
and
looking
up
saw
dog
cart
coming
at
gallop
down
the
road
it
pulled
up
at
our
door
and
our
friend
the
vicar
sprang
from
it
and
rushed
up
our
garden
path
holmes
was
already
dressed
and
we
hastened
down
to
meet
him
our
visitor
was
so
excited
that
he
could
hardly
articulate
but
at
last
in
gasps
and
bursts
his
tragic
story
came
out
of
him
we
are
devil
ridden
mr
holmes
my
poor
parish
is
devilridden
he
cried
satan
himself
is
loose
in
it
we
are
given
over
into
his
hands
he
danced
about
in
his
agitation
ludicrous
object
if
it
were
not
for
his
ashy
face
and
startled
eyes
finally
he
shot
out
his
terrible
news
mr
mortimer
tregennis
died
during
the
night
and
with
exactly
the
same
symptoms
as
the
rest
of
his
family
holmes
sprang
to
his
feet
all
energy
in
an
instant
can
you
fit
us
both
into
your
dog
cart
yes
can
then
watson
we
will
postpone
our
breakfast
mr
roundhay
we
are
entirely
at
your
disposal
hurry
before
things
get
disarranged
the
lodger
occupied
two
rooms
at
the
vicarage
which
were
in
an
angle
by
themselves
the
one
above
the
other
below
was
large
sitting
room
above
his
bedroom
they
looked
out
upon
croquet
lawn
which
came
up
to
the
windows
we
had
arrived
before
the
doctor
or
the
police
so
that
everything
was
absolutely
undisturbed
let
me
describe
exactly
the
scene
as
we
saw
it
upon
that
misty
march
morning
it
has
left
an
impression
which
can
never
be
effaced
from
my
mind
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
was
of
horrible
and
depressing
stuffiness
the
servant
had
first
entered
had
thrown
up
the
window
or
it
would
have
been
even
more
intolerable
this
might
partly
be
due
to
the
fact
that
lamp
stood
flaring
and
smoking
on
the
centre
table
beside
it
sat
the
dead
man
leaning
back
in
his
chair
his
thing
beard
projecting
his
spectacles
pushed
up
on
to
his
forehead
and
his
lean
dark
face
turned
towards
the
window
and
twisted
into
the
same
distortion
of
terror
which
had
marked
the
features
of
his
dead
sister
his
limbs
were
convulsed
and
his
fingers
contorted
as
though
he
had
died
in
very
paroxysm
of
fear
he
was
fully
clothed
though
there
were
signs
that
his
dressing
had
been
done
in
hurry
we
had
already
learned
that
his
bed
had
been
slept
in
and
that
the
tragic
end
had
come
to
him
in
the
early
morning
one
realized
the
red
hot
energy
which
underlay
holmes
phlegmatic
exterior
when
one
saw
the
sudden
change
which
came
over
him
from
the
moment
that
he
entered
the
fatal
apartment
in
an
instant
he
was
tense
and
alert
his
eyes
shining
his
face
set
his
limbs
quivering
with
eager
activity
he
was
out
on
the
lawn
in
through
the
window
round
the
room
and
up
into
the
bedroom
for
all
the
world
like
dashing
foxhound
drawing
cover
in
the
bedroom
he
made
rapid
cast
around
and
ended
by
throwing
open
the
window
which
appeared
to
give
him
some
fresh
cause
for
excitement
for
he
leaned
out
of
it
with
loud
ejaculations
of
interest
and
delight
then
he
rushed
down
the
stair
out
through
the
open
window
threw
himself
upon
his
face
on
the
lawn
sprang
up
and
into
the
room
once
more
all
with
the
energy
of
the
hunter
who
is
at
the
very
heels
of
his
quarry
the
lamp
which
was
an
ordinary
standard
he
examined
with
minute
care
making
certain
measurements
upon
its
bowl
he
carefully
scrutinized
with
his
lens
the
talc
shield
which
covered
the
top
of
the
chimney
and
scraped
off
some
ashes
which
adhered
to
its
upper
surface
putting
some
of
them
into
an
envelope
which
he
placed
in
his
pocketbook
finally
just
as
the
doctor
and
the
official
police
put
in
an
appearance
he
beckoned
to
the
vicar
and
we
all
three
went
out
upon
the
lawn
am
glad
to
say
that
my
investigation
has
not
been
entirely
barren
he
remarked
cannot
remain
to
discuss
the
matter
with
the
police
but
should
be
exceedingly
obliged
mr
roundhay
if
you
would
give
the
inspector
my
compliments
and
direct
his
attention
to
the
bedroom
window
and
to
the
sittingroom
lamp
each
is
suggestive
and
together
they
are
almost
conclusive
if
the
police
would
desire
further
information
shall
be
happy
to
see
any
of
them
at
the
cottage
and
now
watson
think
that
perhaps
we
shall
be
better
employed
elsewhere
it
may
be
that
the
police
resented
the
intrusion
of
an
amateur
or
that
they
imagined
themselves
to
be
upon
some
hopeful
line
of
investigation
but
it
is
certain
that
we
heard
nothing
from
them
for
the
next
two
days
during
this
time
holmes
spent
some
of
his
time
smoking
and
dreaming
in
the
cottage
but
greater
portion
in
country
walks
which
he
undertook
alone
returning
after
many
hours
without
remark
as
to
where
he
had
been
one
experiment
served
to
show
me
the
line
of
his
investigation
he
had
bought
lamp
which
was
the
duplicate
of
the
one
which
had
burned
in
the
room
of
mortimer
tregennis
on
the
morning
of
the
tragedy
this
he
filled
with
the
same
oil
as
that
used
at
the
vicarage
and
he
carefully
timed
the
period
which
it
would
take
to
be
exhausted
another
experiment
which
he
made
was
of
more
unpleasant
nature
and
one
which
am
not
likely
ever
to
forget
you
will
remember
watson
he
remarked
one
afternoon
that
there
is
single
common
point
of
resemblance
in
the
varying
reports
which
have
reached
us
this
concerns
the
effect
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
in
each
case
upon
those
who
had
first
entered
it
you
will
recollect
that
mortimer
tregennis
in
describing
the
episode
of
his
last
visit
to
his
brother
house
remarked
that
the
doctor
on
entering
the
room
fell
into
chair
you
had
forgotten
well
can
answer
for
it
that
it
was
so
now
you
will
remember
also
that
mrs
porter
the
housekeeper
told
us
that
she
herself
fainted
upon
entering
the
room
and
had
afterwards
opened
the
window
in
the
second
case
that
of
mortimer
tregennis
himself
you
cannot
have
forgotten
the
horrible
stuffiness
of
the
room
when
we
arrived
though
the
servant
had
thrown
open
the
window
that
servant
found
upon
inquiry
was
so
ill
that
she
had
gone
to
her
bed
you
will
admit
watson
that
these
facts
are
very
suggestive
in
each
case
there
is
evidence
of
poisonous
atmosphere
in
each
case
also
there
is
combustion
going
on
in
the
room
in
the
one
case
fire
in
the
other
lamp
the
fire
was
needed
but
the
lamp
was
lit
as
comparison
of
the
oil
consumed
will
show
long
after
it
was
broad
daylight
why
surely
because
there
is
some
connection
between
three
things
the
burning
the
stuffy
atmosphere
and
finally
the
madness
or
death
of
those
unfortunate
people
that
is
clear
is
it
not

it
would
appear
so
at
least
we
may
accept
it
as
working
hypothesis
we
will
suppose
then
that
something
was
burned
in
each
case
which
produced
an
atmosphere
causing
strange
toxic
effects
very
good
in
the
first
instance
that
of
the
tregennis
family
this
substance
was
placed
in
the
fire
now
the
window
was
shut
but
the
fire
would
naturally
carry
fumes
to
some
extent
up
the
chimney
hence
one
would
expect
the
effects
of
the
poison
to
be
less
than
in
the
second
case
where
there
was
less
escape
for
the
vapour
the
result
seems
to
indicate
that
it
was
so
since
in
the
first
case
only
the
woman
who
had
presumably
the
more
sensitive
organism
was
killed
the
others
exhibiting
that
temporary
or
permanent
lunacy
which
is
evidently
the
first
effect
of
the
drug
in
the
second
case
the
result
was
complete
the
facts
therefore
seem
to
bear
out
the
theory
of
poison
which
worked
by
combustion
with
this
train
of
reasoning
in
my
head
naturally
looked
about
in
mortimer
tregennis
room
to
find
some
remains
of
this
substance
the
obvious
place
to
look
was
the
talc
shelf
or
smoke
guard
of
the
lamp
there
sure
enough
perceived
number
of
flaky
ashes
and
round
the
edges
fringe
of
brownish
powder
which
had
not
yet
been
consumed
half
of
this
took
as
you
saw
and
placed
it
in
an
envelope
why
half
holmes
it
is
not
for
me
my
dear
watson
to
stand
in
the
way
of
the
official
police
force
leave
them
all
the
evidence
which
found
the
poison
still
remained
upon
the
talc
had
they
the
wit
to
find
it
now
watson
we
will
light
our
lamp
we
will
however
take
the
precaution
to
open
our
window
to
avoid
the
premature
decease
of
two
deserving
members
of
society
and
you
will
seat
yourself
near
that
open
window
in
an
armchair
unless
like
sensible
man
you
determine
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
affair
oh
you
will
see
it
out
will
you
thought
knew
my
watson
this
chair
will
place
opposite
yours
so
that
we
may
be
the
same
distance
from
the
poison
and
face
to
face
the
door
we
will
leave
ajar
each
is
now
in
position
to
watch
the
other
and
to
bring
the
experiment
to
an
end
should
the
symptoms
seem
alarming
is
that
all
clear
well
then
take
our
powder
or
what
remains
of
it
from
the
envelope
and
lay
it
above
the
burning
lamp
so
now
watson
let
us
sit
down
and
await
developments
they
were
not
long
in
coming
had
hardly
settled
in
my
chair
before
was
conscious
of
thick
musky
odour
subtle
and
nauseous
at
the
very
first
whiff
of
it
my
brain
and
my
imagination
were
beyond
all
control
thick
black
cloud
swirled
before
my
eyes
and
my
mind
told
me
that
in
this
cloud
unseen
as
yet
but
about
to
spring
out
upon
my
appalled
senses
lurked
all
that
was
vaguely
horrible
all
that
was
monstrous
and
inconceivably
wicked
in
the
universe
vague
shapes
swirled
and
swam
amid
the
dark
cloud
bank
each
menace
and
warning
of
something
coming
the
advent
of
some
unspeakable
dweller
upon
the
threshold
whose
very
shadow
would
blast
my
soul
freezing
horror
took
possession
of
me
felt
that
my
hair
was
rising
that
my
eyes
were
protruding
that
my
mouth
was
opened
and
my
tongue
like
leather
the
turmoil
within
my
brain
was
such
that
something
must
surely
snap
tried
to
scream
and
was
vaguely
aware
of
some
hoarse
croak
which
was
my
own
voice
but
distant
and
detached
from
myself
at
the
same
moment
in
some
effort
of
escape
broke
through
that
cloud
of
despair
and
had
glimpse
of
holmes
face
white
rigid
and
drawn
with
horror
the
very
look
which
had
seen
upon
the
features
of
the
dead
it
was
that
vision
which
gave
me
an
instant
of
sanity
and
of
strength
dashed
from
my
chair
threw
my
arms
round
holmes
and
together
we
lurched
through
the
door
and
an
instant
afterwards
had
thrown
ourselves
down
upon
the
grass
plot
and
were
lying
side
by
side
conscious
only
of
the
glorious
sunshine
which
was
bursting
its
way
through
the
hellish
cloud
of
terror
which
had
girt
us
in
slowly
it
rose
from
our
souls
like
the
mists
from
landscape
until
peace
and
reason
had
returned
and
we
were
sitting
upon
the
grass
wiping
our
clammy
foreheads
and
looking
with
apprehension
at
each
other
to
mark
the
last
traces
of
that
terrific
experience
which
we
had
undergone
upon
my
word
watson
said
holmes
at
last
with
an
unsteady
voice
owe
you
both
my
thanks
and
an
apology
it
was
an
unjustifiable
experiment
even
for
one
self
and
doubly
so
for
friend
am
really
very
sorry
you
know
answered
with
some
emotion
for
have
never
seen
so
much
of
holmes
heart
before
that
it
is
my
greatest
joy
and
privilege
to
help
you
he
relapsed
at
once
into
the
half
humorous
half
cynical
vein
which
was
his
habitual
attitude
to
those
about
him
it
would
be
superfluous
to
drive
us
mad
my
dear
watson
said
he
candid
observer
would
certainly
declare
that
we
were
so
already
before
we
embarked
upon
so
wild
an
experiment
confess
that
never
imagined
that
the
effect
could
be
so
sudden
and
so
severe
he
dashed
into
the
cottage
and
reappearing
with
the
burning
lamp
held
at
full
arm
length
he
threw
it
among
bank
of
brambles
we
must
give
the
room
little
time
to
clear
take
it
watson
that
you
have
no
longer
shadow
of
doubt
as
to
how
these
tragedies
were
produced
none
whatever
but
the
cause
remains
as
obscure
as
before
come
into
the
arbour
here
and
let
us
discuss
it
together
that
villainous
stuff
seems
still
to
linger
round
my
throat
think
we
must
admit
that
all
the
evidence
points
to
this
man
mortimer
tregennis
having
been
the
criminal
in
the
first
tragedy
though
he
was
the
victim
in
the
second
one
we
must
remember
in
the
first
place
that
there
is
some
story
of
family
quarrel
followed
by
reconciliation
how
bitter
that
quarrel
may
have
been
or
how
hollow
the
reconciliation
we
cannot
tell
when
think
of
mortimer
tregennis
with
the
foxy
face
and
the
small
shrewd
beady
eyes
behind
the
spectacles
he
is
not
man
whom
should
judge
to
be
of
particularly
forgiving
disposition
well
in
the
next
place
you
will
remember
that
this
idea
of
someone
moving
in
the
garden
which
took
our
attention
for
moment
from
the
real
cause
of
the
tragedy
emanated
from
him
he
had
motive
in
misleading
us
finally
if
he
did
not
throw
the
substance
into
the
fire
at
the
moment
of
leaving
the
room
who
did
do
so
the
affair
happened
immediately
after
his
departure
had
anyone
else
come
in
the
family
would
certainly
have
risen
from
the
table
besides
in
peaceful
cornwall
visitors
did
not
arrive
after
ten
clock
at
night
we
may
take
it
then
that
all
the
evidence
points
to
mortimer
tregennis
as
the
culprit
then
his
own
death
was
suicide
well
watson
it
is
on
the
face
of
it
not
impossible
supposition
the
man
who
had
the
guilt
upon
his
soul
of
having
brought
such
fate
upon
his
own
family
might
well
be
driven
by
remorse
to
inflict
it
upon
himself
there
are
however
some
cogent
reasons
against
it
fortunately
there
is
one
man
in
england
who
knows
all
about
it
and
have
made
arrangements
by
which
we
shall
hear
the
facts
this
afternoon
from
his
own
lips
ah
he
is
little
before
his
time
perhaps
you
would
kindly
step
this
way
dr
leon
sterndale
we
have
been
conducing
chemical
experiment
indoors
which
has
left
our
little
room
hardly
fit
for
the
reception
of
so
distinguished
visitor
had
heard
the
click
of
the
garden
gate
and
now
the
majestic
figure
of
the
great
african
explorer
appeared
upon
the
path
he
turned
in
some
surprise
towards
the
rustic
arbour
in
which
we
sat
you
sent
for
me
mr
holmes
had
your
note
about
an
hour
ago
and
have
come
though
really
do
not
know
why
should
obey
your
summons
perhaps
we
can
clear
the
point
up
before
we
separate
said
holmes
meanwhile
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
courteous
acquiescence
you
will
excuse
this
informal
reception
in
the
open
air
but
my
friend
watson
and
have
nearly
furnished
an
additional
chapter
to
what
the
papers
call
the
cornish
horror
and
we
prefer
clear
atmosphere
for
the
present
perhaps
since
the
matters
which
we
have
to
discuss
will
affect
you
personally
in
very
intimate
fashion
it
is
as
well
that
we
should
talk
where
there
can
be
no
eavesdropping
the
explorer
took
his
cigar
from
his
lips
and
gazed
sternly
at
my
companion
am
at
loss
to
know
sir
he
said
what
you
can
have
to
speak
about
which
affects
me
personally
in
very
intimate
fashion
the
killing
of
mortimer
tregennis
said
holmes
for
moment
wished
that
were
armed
sterndale
fierce
face
turned
to
dusky
red
his
eyes
glared
and
the
knotted
passionate
veins
started
out
in
his
forehead
while
he
sprang
forward
with
clenched
hands
towards
my
companion
then
he
stopped
and
with
violent
effort
he
resumed
cold
rigid
calmness
which
was
perhaps
more
suggestive
of
danger
than
his
hot
headed
outburst
have
lived
so
long
among
savages
and
beyond
the
law
said
he
that
have
got
into
the
way
of
being
law
to
myself
you
would
do
well
mr
holmes
not
to
forget
it
for
have
no
desire
to
do
you
an
injury

nor
have
any
desire
to
do
you
an
injury
dr
sterndale
surely
the
clearest
proof
of
it
is
that
knowing
what
know
have
sent
for
you
and
not
for
the
police
sterndale
sat
down
with
gasp
overawed
for
perhaps
the
first
time
in
his
adventurous
life
there
was
calm
assurance
of
power
in
holmes
manner
which
could
not
be
withstood
our
visitor
stammered
for
moment
his
great
hands
opening
and
shutting
in
his
agitation
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
at
last
if
this
is
bluff
upon
your
part
mr
holmes
you
have
chosen
bad
man
for
your
experiment
let
us
have
no
more
beating
about
the
bush
what
do
you
mean
will
tell
you
said
holmes
and
the
reason
why
tell
you
is
that
hope
frankness
may
beget
frankness
what
my
next
step
may
be
will
depend
entirely
upon
the
nature
of
your
own
defence
my
defence
yes
sir
my
defence
against
what
against
the
charge
of
killing
mortimer
tregennis
sterndale
mopped
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
upon
my
word
you
are
getting
on
said
he
do
all
your
successes
depend
upon
this
prodigious
power
of
bluff
the
bluff
said
holmes
sternly
is
upon
your
side
dr
leon
sterndale
and
not
upon
mine
as
proof
will
tell
you
some
of
the
facts
upon
which
my
conclusions
are
based
of
your
return
from
plymouth
allowing
much
of
your
property
to
go
on
to
africa
will
say
nothing
save
that
it
first
informed
me
that
you
were
one
of
the
factors
which
had
to
be
taken
into
account
in
reconstructing
this
drama—
came
back—
have
heard
your
reasons
and
regard
them
as
unconvincing
and
inadequate
we
will
pass
that
you
came
down
here
to
ask
me
whom
suspected
refused
to
answer
you
then
went
to
the
vicarage
waited
outside
it
for
some
time
and
finally
returned
to
your
cottage
how
do
you
know
that
followed
you
saw
no
one
that
is
what
you
may
expect
to
see
when
follow
you
spent
restless
night
at
your
cottage
and
you
formed
certain
plans
which
in
the
early
morning
you
proceeded
to
put
into
execution
leaving
your
door
just
as
day
was
breaking
you
filled
your
pocket
with
some
reddish
gravel
that
was
lying
heaped
beside
your
gate
sterndale
gave
violent
start
and
looked
at
holmes
in
amazement
you
then
walked
swiftly
for
the
mile
which
separated
you
from
the
vicarage
you
were
wearing
may
remark
the
same
pair
of
ribbed
tennis
shoes
which
are
at
the
present
moment
upon
your
feet
at
the
vicarage
you
passed
through
the
orchard
and
the
side
hedge
coming
out
under
the
window
of
the
lodger
tregennis
it
was
now
daylight
but
the
household
was
not
yet
stirring
you
drew
some
of
the
gravel
from
your
pocket
and
you
threw
it
up
at
the
window
above
you
sterndale
sprang
to
his
feet
believe
that
you
are
the
devil
himself
he
cried
holmes
smiled
at
the
compliment
it
took
two
or
possibly
three
handfuls
before
the
lodger
came
to
the
window
you
beckoned
him
to
come
down
he
dressed
hurriedly
and
descended
to
his
sitting
room
you
entered
by
the
window
there
was
an
interview
short
one
during
which
you
walked
up
and
down
the
room
then
you
passed
out
and
closed
the
window
standing
on
the
lawn
outside
smoking
cigar
and
watching
what
occurred
finally
after
the
death
of
tregennis
you
withdrew
as
you
had
come
now
dr
sterndale
how
do
you
justify
such
conduct
and
what
were
the
motives
for
your
actions
if
you
prevaricate
or
trifle
with
me
give
you
my
assurance
that
the
matter
will
pass
out
of
my
hands
forever
our
visitor
face
had
turned
ashen
grey
as
he
listened
to
the
words
of
his
accuser
now
he
sat
for
some
time
in
thought
with
his
face
sunk
in
his
hands
then
with
sudden
impulsive
gesture
he
plucked
photograph
from
his
breast
pocket
and
threw
it
on
the
rustic
table
before
us
that
is
why
have
done
it
said
he
it
showed
the
bust
and
face
of
very
beautiful
woman
holmes
stooped
over
it
brenda
tregennis
said
he
yes
brenda
tregennis
repeated
our
visitor
for
years
have
loved
her
for
years
she
has
loved
me
there
is
the
secret
of
that
cornish
seclusion
which
people
have
marvelled
at
it
has
brought
me
close
to
the
one
thing
on
earth
that
was
dear
to
me
could
not
marry
her
for
have
wife
who
has
left
me
for
years
and
yet
whom
by
the
deplorable
laws
of
england
could
not
divorce
for
years
brenda
waited
for
years
waited
and
this
is
what
we
have
waited
for
terrible
sob
shook
his
great
frame
and
he
clutched
his
throat
under
his
brindled
beard
then
with
an
effort
he
mastered
himself
and
spoke
on
the
vicar
knew
he
was
in
our
confidence
he
would
tell
you
that
she
was
an
angel
upon
earth
that
was
why
he
telegraphed
to
me
and
returned
what
was
my
baggage
or
africa
to
me
when
learned
that
such
fate
had
come
upon
my
darling
there
you
have
the
missing
clue
to
my
action
mr
holmes
proceed
said
my
friend
dr
sterndale
drew
from
his
pocket
paper
packet
and
laid
it
upon
the
table
on
the
outside
was
written
radix
pedis
diaboli
with
red
poison
label
beneath
it
he
pushed
it
towards
me
understand
that
you
are
doctor
sir
have
you
ever
heard
of
this
preparation
devil
foot
root
no
have
never
heard
of
it
is
no
reflection
upon
your
professional
knowledge
said
he
for
believe
that
save
for
one
sample
in
laboratory
at
buda
there
is
no
other
specimen
in
europe
it
has
not
yet
found
its
way
either
into
the
pharmacopoeia
or
into
the
literature
of
toxicology
the
root
is
shaped
like
foot
half
human
half
goatlike
hence
the
fanciful
name
given
by
botanical
missionary
it
is
used
as
an
ordeal
poison
by
the
medicine
men
in
certain
districts
of
west
africa
and
is
kept
as
secret
among
them
this
particular
specimen
obtained
under
very
extraordinary
circumstances
in
the
ubangi
country
he
opened
the
paper
as
he
spoke
and
disclosed
heap
of
reddish
brown
snuff
like
powder
well
sir
asked
holmes
sternly
am
about
to
tell
you
mr
holmes
all
that
actually
occurred
for
you
already
know
so
much
that
it
is
clearly
to
my
interest
that
you
should
know
all
have
already
explained
the
relationship
in
which
stood
to
the
tregennis
family
for
the
sake
of
the
sister
was
friendly
with
the
brothers
there
was
family
quarrel
about
money
which
estranged
this
man
mortimer
but
it
was
supposed
to
be
made
up
and
afterwards
met
him
as
did
the
others
he
was
sly
subtle
scheming
man
and
several
things
arose
which
gave
me
suspicion
of
him
but
had
no
cause
for
any
positive
quarrel
one
day
only
couple
of
weeks
ago
he
came
down
to
my
cottage
and
showed
him
some
of
my
african
curiosities
among
other
things
exhibited
this
powder
and
told
him
of
its
strange
properties
how
it
stimulates
those
brain
centres
which
control
the
emotion
of
fear
and
how
either
madness
or
death
is
the
fate
of
the
unhappy
native
who
is
subjected
to
the
ordeal
by
the
priest
of
his
tribe
told
him
also
how
powerless
european
science
would
be
to
detect
it
how
he
took
it
cannot
say
for
never
left
the
room
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
was
then
while
was
opening
cabinets
and
stooping
to
boxes
that
he
managed
to
abstract
some
of
the
devil
foot
root
well
remember
how
he
plied
me
with
questions
as
to
the
amount
and
the
time
that
was
needed
for
its
effect
but
little
dreamed
that
he
could
have
personal
reason
for
asking
thought
no
more
of
the
matter
until
the
vicar
telegram
reached
me
at
plymouth
this
villain
had
thought
that
would
be
at
sea
before
the
news
could
reach
me
and
that
should
be
lost
for
years
in
africa
but
returned
at
once
of
course
could
not
listen
to
the
details
without
feeling
assured
that
my
poison
had
been
used
came
round
to
see
you
on
the
chance
that
some
other
explanation
had
suggested
itself
to
you
but
there
could
be
none
was
convinced
that
mortimer
tregennis
was
the
murderer
that
for
the
sake
of
money
and
with
the
idea
perhaps
that
if
the
other
members
of
his
family
were
all
insane
he
would
be
the
sole
guardian
of
their
joint
property
he
had
used
the
devil
foot
powder
upon
them
driven
two
of
them
out
of
their
senses
and
killed
his
sister
brenda
the
one
human
being
whom
have
ever
loved
or
who
has
ever
loved
me
there
was
his
crime
what
was
to
be
his
punishment
should
appeal
to
the
law
where
were
my
proofs
knew
that
the
facts
were
true
but
could
help
to
make
jury
of
countrymen
believe
so
fantastic
story
might
or
might
not
but
could
not
afford
to
fail
my
soul
cried
out
for
revenge
have
said
to
you
once
before
mr
holmes
that
have
spent
much
of
my
life
outside
the
law
and
that
have
come
at
last
to
be
law
to
myself
so
it
was
even
now
determined
that
the
fate
which
he
had
given
to
others
should
be
shared
by
himself
either
that
or
would
do
justice
upon
him
with
my
own
hand
in
all
england
there
can
be
no
man
who
sets
less
value
upon
his
own
life
than
do
at
the
present
moment

now
have
told
you
all
you
have
yourself
supplied
the
rest
did
as
you
say
after
restless
night
set
off
early
from
my
cottage
foresaw
the
difficulty
of
arousing
him
so
gathered
some
gravel
from
the
pile
which
you
have
mentioned
and
used
it
to
throw
up
to
his
window
he
came
down
and
admitted
me
through
the
window
of
the
sitting
room
laid
his
offence
before
him
told
him
that
had
come
both
as
judge
and
executioner
the
wretch
sank
into
chair
paralyzed
at
the
sight
of
my
revolver
lit
the
lamp
put
the
powder
above
it
and
stood
outside
the
window
ready
to
carry
out
my
threat
to
shoot
him
should
he
try
to
leave
the
room
in
five
minutes
he
died
my
god
how
he
died
but
my
heart
was
flint
for
he
endured
nothing
which
my
innocent
darling
had
not
felt
before
him
there
is
my
story
mr
holmes
perhaps
if
you
loved
woman
you
would
have
done
as
much
yourself
at
any
rate
am
in
your
hands
you
can
take
what
steps
you
like
as
have
already
said
there
is
no
man
living
who
can
fear
death
less
than
do
holmes
sat
for
some
little
time
in
silence
what
were
your
plans
he
asked
at
last
had
intended
to
bury
myself
in
central
africa
my
work
there
is
but
half
finished
go
and
do
the
other
half
said
holmes
at
least
am
not
prepared
to
prevent
you
dr
sterndale
raised
his
giant
figure
bowed
gravely
and
walked
from
the
arbour
holmes
lit
his
pipe
and
handed
me
his
pouch
some
fumes
which
are
not
poisonous
would
be
welcome
change
said
he
think
you
must
agree
watson
that
it
is
not
case
in
which
we
are
called
upon
to
interfere
our
investigation
has
been
independent
and
our
action
shall
be
so
also
you
would
not
denounce
the
man
certainly
not
answered
have
never
loved
watson
but
if
did
and
if
the
woman
loved
had
met
such
an
end
might
act
even
as
our
lawless
lionhunter
has
done
who
knows
well
watson
will
not
offend
your
intelligence
by
explaining
what
is
obvious
the
gravel
upon
the
window
sill
was
of
course
the
starting
point
of
my
research
it
was
unlike
anything
in
the
vicarage
garden
only
when
my
attention
had
been
drawn
to
dr
sterndale
and
his
cottage
did
find
its
counterpart
the
lamp
shining
in
broad
daylight
and
the
remains
of
powder
upon
the
shield
were
successive
links
in
fairly
obvious
chain
and
now
my
dear
watson
think
we
may
dismiss
the
matter
from
our
mind
and
go
back
with
clear
conscience
to
the
study
of
those
chaldean
roots
which
are
surely
to
be
traced
in
the
cornish
branch
of
the
great
celtic
speech
the
adventure
of
the
red
circle
well
mrs
warren
cannot
see
that
you
have
any
particular
cause
for
uneasiness
nor
do
understand
why
whose
time
is
of
some
value
should
interfere
in
the
matter
really
have
other
things
to
engage
me
so
spoke
sherlock
holmes
and
turned
back
to
the
great
scrapbook
in
which
he
was
arranging
and
indexing
some
of
his
recent
material
but
the
landlady
had
the
pertinacity
and
also
the
cunning
of
her
sex
she
held
her
ground
firmly
you
arranged
an
affair
for
lodger
of
mine
last
year
she
said—
mr
fairdale
hobbs
ah
yes
simple
matter
but
he
would
never
cease
talking
of
it
your
kindness
sir
and
the
way
in
which
you
brought
light
into
the
darkness
remembered
his
words
when
was
in
doubt
and
darkness
myself
know
you
could
if
you
only
would
holmes
was
accessible
upon
the
side
of
flattery
and
also
to
do
him
justice
upon
the
side
of
kindliness
the
two
forces
made
him
lay
down
his
gum
brush
with
sigh
of
resignation
and
push
back
his
chair
well
mrs
warren
let
us
hear
about
it
then
you
don
object
to
tobacco
take
it
thank
you
watson
the
matches
you
are
uneasy
as
understand
because
your
new
lodger
remains
in
his
rooms
and
you
cannot
see
him
why
bless
you
mrs
warren
if
were
your
lodger
you
often
would
not
see
me
for
weeks
on
end
no
doubt
sir
but
this
is
different
it
frightens
me
mr
holmes
can
sleep
for
fright
to
hear
his
quick
step
moving
here
and
moving
there
from
early
morning
to
late
at
night
and
yet
never
to
catch
so
much
as
glimpse
of
him
it
more
than
can
stand
my
husband
is
as
nervous
over
it
as
am
but
he
is
out
at
his
work
all
day
while
get
no
rest
from
it
what
is
he
hiding
for
what
has
he
done
except
for
the
girl
am
all
alone
in
the
house
with
him
and
it
more
than
my
nerves
can
stand
holmes
leaned
forward
and
laid
his
long
thin
fingers
upon
the
woman
shoulder
he
had
an
almost
hypnotic
power
of
soothing
when
he
wished
the
scared
look
faded
from
her
eyes
and
her
agitated
features
smoothed
into
their
usual
commonplace
she
sat
down
in
the
chair
which
he
had
indicated
if
take
it
up
must
understand
every
detail
said
he
take
time
to
consider
the
smallest
point
may
be
the
most
essential
you
say
that
the
man
came
ten
days
ago
and
paid
you
for
fortnight
board
and
lodging
he
asked
my
terms
sir
said
fifty
shillings
week
there
is
small
sitting
room
and
bedroom
and
all
complete
at
the
top
of
the
house
well
he
said
ll
pay
you
five
pounds
week
if
can
have
it
on
my
own
terms
poor
woman
sir
and
mr
warren
earns
little
and
the
money
meant
much
to
me
he
took
out
ten
pound
note
and
he
held
it
out
to
me
then
and
there
you
can
have
the
same
every
fortnight
for
long
time
to
come
if
you
keep
the
terms
he
said
if
not
ll
have
no
more
to
do
with
you
what
were
the
terms
well
sir
they
were
that
he
was
to
have
key
of
the
house
that
was
all
right
lodgers
often
have
them
also
that
he
was
to
be
left
entirely
to
himself
and
never
upon
any
excuse
to
be
disturbed
nothing
wonderful
in
that
surely
not
in
reason
sir
but
this
is
out
of
all
reason
he
has
been
there
for
ten
days
and
neither
mr
warren
nor
the
girl
has
once
set
eyes
upon
him
we
can
hear
that
quick
step
of
his
pacing
up
and
down
up
and
down
night
morning
and
noon
but
except
on
that
first
night
he
had
never
once
gone
out
of
the
house
oh
he
went
out
the
first
night
did
he
yes
sir
and
returned
very
late
after
we
were
all
in
bed
he
told
me
after
he
had
taken
the
rooms
that
he
would
do
so
and
asked
me
not
to
bar
the
door
heard
him
come
up
the
stair
after
midnight
but
his
meals
it
was
his
particular
direction
that
we
should
always
when
he
rang
leave
his
meal
upon
chair
outside
his
door
then
he
rings
again
when
he
has
finished
and
we
take
it
down
from
the
same
chair
if
he
wants
anything
else
he
prints
it
on
slip
of
paper
and
leaves
it
prints
it
yes
sir
prints
it
in
pencil
just
the
word
nothing
more
here
the
one
brought
to
show
you
soap
here
another—
match
this
is
one
he
left
the
first
morning
daily
gazette
leave
that
paper
with
his
breakfast
every
morning
dear
me
watson
said
homes
staring
with
great
curiosity
at
the
slips
of
foolscap
which
the
landlady
had
handed
to
him
this
is
certainly
little
unusual
seclusion
can
understand
but
why
print
printing
is
clumsy
process
why
not
write
what
would
it
suggest
watson
that
he
desired
to
conceal
his
handwriting
but
why
what
can
it
matter
to
him
that
his
landlady
should
have
word
of
his
writing
still
it
may
be
as
you
say
then
again
why
such
laconic
messages
cannot
imagine
it
opens
pleasing
field
for
intelligent
speculation
the
words
are
written
with
broad
pointed
violet
tinted
pencil
of
not
unusual
pattern
you
will
observe
that
the
paper
is
torn
away
at
the
side
here
after
the
printing
was
done
so
that
the
of
soap
is
partly
gone
suggestive
watson
is
it
not
of
caution
exactly
there
was
evidently
some
mark
some
thumbprint
something
which
might
give
clue
to
the
person
identity
now
mrs
warren
you
say
that
the
man
was
of
middle
size
dark
and
bearded
what
age
would
he
be
youngish
sir
not
over
thirty
well
can
you
give
me
no
further
indications
he
spoke
good
english
sir
and
yet
thought
he
was
foreigner
by
his
accent
and
he
was
well
dressed
very
smartly
dressed
sir
quite
the
gentleman
dark
clothes—
nothing
you
would
note
he
gave
no
name
no
sir
and
has
had
no
letters
or
callers
none
but
surely
you
or
the
girl
enter
his
room
of
morning
no
sir
he
looks
after
himself
entirely
dear
me
that
is
certainly
remarkable
what
about
his
luggage
he
had
one
big
brown
bag
with
him
nothing
else
well
we
don
seem
to
have
much
material
to
help
us
do
you
say
nothing
has
come
out
of
that
room
absolutely
nothing
the
landlady
drew
an
envelope
from
her
bag
from
it
she
shook
out
two
burnt
matches
and
cigarette
end
upon
the
table

they
were
on
his
tray
this
morning
brought
them
because
had
heard
that
you
can
read
great
things
out
of
small
ones
holmes
shrugged
his
shoulders
there
is
nothing
here
said
he
the
matches
have
of
course
been
used
to
light
cigarettes
that
is
obvious
from
the
shortness
of
the
burnt
end
half
the
match
is
consumed
in
lighting
pipe
or
cigar
but
dear
me
this
cigarette
stub
is
certainly
remarkable
the
gentleman
was
bearded
and
moustached
you
say
yes
sir
don
understand
that
should
say
that
only
clean
shaven
man
could
have
smoked
this
why
watson
even
your
modest
moustache
would
have
been
singed
holder
suggested
no
the
end
is
matted
suppose
there
could
not
be
two
people
in
your
rooms
mrs
warren
no
sir
he
eats
so
little
that
often
wonder
it
can
keep
life
in
one
well
think
we
must
wait
for
little
more
material
after
all
you
have
nothing
to
complain
of
you
have
received
your
rent
and
he
is
not
troublesome
lodger
though
he
is
certainly
an
unusual
one
he
pays
you
well
and
if
he
chooses
to
lie
concealed
it
is
no
direct
business
of
yours
we
have
no
excuse
for
an
intrusion
upon
his
privacy
until
we
have
some
reason
to
think
that
there
is
guilty
reason
for
it
ve
taken
up
the
matter
and
won
lose
sight
of
it
report
to
me
if
anything
fresh
occurs
and
rely
upon
my
assistance
if
it
should
be
needed
there
are
certainly
some
points
of
interest
in
this
case
watson
he
remarked
when
the
landlady
had
left
us
it
may
of
course
be
trivial
individual
eccentricity
or
it
may
be
very
much
deeper
than
appears
on
the
surface
the
first
thing
that
strike
one
is
the
obvious
possibility
that
the
person
now
in
the
rooms
may
be
entirely
different
from
the
one
who
engaged
them
why
should
you
think
so
well
apart
form
this
cigarette
end
was
it
not
suggestive
that
the
only
time
the
lodger
went
out
was
immediately
after
his
taking
the
rooms
he
came
back
or
someone
came
back
when
all
witnesses
were
out
of
the
way
we
have
no
proof
that
the
person
who
came
back
was
the
person
who
went
out
then
again
the
man
who
took
the
rooms
spoke
english
well
this
other
however
prints
match
when
it
should
have
been
matches
can
imagine
that
the
word
was
taken
out
of
dictionary
which
would
give
the
noun
but
not
the
plural
the
laconic
style
may
be
to
conceal
the
absence
of
knowledge
of
english
yes
watson
there
are
good
reasons
to
suspect
that
there
has
been
substitution
of
lodgers
but
for
what
possible
end
ah
there
lies
our
problem
there
is
one
rather
obvious
line
of
investigation
he
took
down
the
great
book
in
which
day
by
day
he
filed
the
agony
columns
of
the
various
london
journals
dear
me
said
he
turning
over
the
pages
what
chorus
of
groans
cries
and
bleatings
what
rag
bag
of
singular
happenings
but
surely
the
most
valuable
hunting
ground
that
ever
was
given
to
student
of
the
unusual
this
person
is
alone
and
cannot
be
approached
by
letter
without
breach
of
that
absolute
secrecy
which
is
desired
how
is
any
news
or
any
message
to
reach
him
from
without
obviously
by
advertisement
through
newspaper
there
seems
no
other
way
and
fortunately
we
need
concern
ourselves
with
the
one
paper
only
here
are
the
daily
gazette
extracts
of
the
last
fortnight
lady
with
black
boa
at
prince
skating
club
—that
we
may
pass
surely
jimmy
will
not
break
his
mother
heart
—that
appears
to
be
irrelevant
if
the
lady
who
fainted
on
brixton
bus
—she
does
not
interest
me
every
day
my
heart
longs—
bleat
watson—
unmitigated
bleat
ah
this
is
little
more
possible
listen
to
this
be
patient
will
find
some
sure
means
of
communications
meanwhile
this
column
that
is
two
days
after
mrs
warren
lodger
arrived
it
sounds
plausible
does
it
not
the
mysterious
one
could
understand
english
even
if
he
could
not
print
it
let
us
see
if
we
can
pick
up
the
trace
again
yes
here
we
are
three
days
later
am
making
successful
arrangements
patience
and
prudence
the
clouds
will
pass
nothing
for
week
after
that
then
comes
something
much
more
definite
the
path
is
clearing
if
find
chance
signal
message
remember
code
agreed
one
two
and
so
on
you
will
hear
soon
that
was
in
yesterday
paper
and
there
is
nothing
in
to
day
it
all
very
appropriate
to
mrs
warren
lodger
if
we
wait
little
watson
don
doubt
that
the
affair
will
grow
more
intelligible
so
it
proved
for
in
the
morning
found
my
friend
standing
on
the
hearthrug
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
smile
of
complete
satisfaction
upon
his
face
how
this
watson
he
cried
picking
up
the
paper
from
the
table
high
red
house
with
white
stone
facings
third
floor
second
window
left
after
dusk
that
is
definite
enough
think
after
breakfast
we
must
make
little
reconnaissance
of
mrs
warren
neighbourhood
ah
mrs
warren
what
news
do
you
bring
us
this
morning
our
client
had
suddenly
burst
into
the
room
with
an
explosive
energy
which
told
of
some
new
and
momentous
development
it
police
matter
mr
holmes
she
cried
ll
have
no
more
of
it
he
shall
pack
out
of
there
with
his
baggage
would
have
gone
straight
up
and
told
him
so
only
thought
it
was
but
fair
to
you
to
take
your
opinion
first
but
at
the
end
of
my
patience
and
when
it
comes
to
knocking
my
old
man
about—
knocking
mr
warren
about
using
him
roughly
anyway
but
who
used
him
roughly
ah
that
what
we
want
to
know
it
was
this
morning
sir
mr
warren
is
timekeeper
at
morton
and
waylight
in
tottenham
court
road
he
has
to
be
out
of
the
house
before
seven
well
this
morning
he
had
not
gone
ten
paces
down
the
road
when
two
men
came
up
behind
him
threw
coat
over
his
head
and
bundled
him
into
cab
that
was
beside
the
curb
they
drove
him
an
hour
and
then
opened
the
door
and
shot
him
out
he
lay
in
the
roadway
so
shaken
in
his
wits
that
he
never
saw
what
became
of
the
cab
when
he
picked
himself
up
he
found
he
was
on
hampstead
heath
so
he
took
bus
home
and
there
he
lies
now
on
his
sofa
while
came
straight
round
to
tell
you
what
had
happened
most
interesting
said
holmes
did
he
observe
the
appearance
of
these
men
did
he
hear
them
talk
no
he
is
clean
dazed
he
just
knows
that
he
was
lifted
up
as
if
by
magic
and
dropped
as
if
by
magic
two
least
were
in
it
and
maybe
three
and
you
connect
this
attack
with
your
lodger
well
we
ve
lived
there
fifteen
years
and
no
such
happenings
ever
came
before
ve
had
enough
of
him
money
not
everything
ll
have
him
out
of
my
house
before
the
day
is
done
wait
bit
mrs
warren
do
nothing
rash
begin
to
think
that
this
affair
may
be
very
much
more
important
than
appeared
at
first
sight
it
is
clear
now
that
some
danger
is
threatening
your
lodger
it
is
equally
clear
that
his
enemies
lying
in
wait
for
him
near
your
door
mistook
your
husband
for
him
in
the
foggy
morning
light
on
discovering
their
mistake
they
released
him
what
they
would
have
done
had
it
not
been
mistake
we
can
only
conjecture
well
what
am
to
do
mr
holmes
have
great
fancy
to
see
this
lodger
of
yours
mrs
warren
don
see
how
that
is
to
be
managed
unless
you
break
in
the
door
always
hear
him
unlock
it
as
go
down
the
stair
after
leave
the
tray
he
has
to
take
the
tray
in
surely
we
could
conceal
ourselves
and
see
him
do
it
the
landlady
thought
for
moment
well
sir
there
the
box
room
opposite
could
arrange
looking
glass
maybe
and
if
you
were
behind
the
door—
excellent
said
holmes
when
does
he
lunch
about
one
sir
then
dr
watson
and
will
come
round
in
time
for
the
present
mrs
warren
good
bye
at
half
past
twelve
we
found
ourselves
upon
the
steps
of
mrs
warren
house
high
thin
yellow
brick
edifice
in
great
orme
street
narrow
thoroughfare
at
the
northeast
side
of
the
british
museum
standing
as
it
does
near
the
corner
of
the
street
it
commands
view
down
howe
street
with
its
ore
pretentious
houses
holmes
pointed
with
chuckle
to
one
of
these
row
of
residential
flats
which
projected
so
that
they
could
not
fail
to
catch
the
eye
see
watson
said
he
high
red
house
with
stone
facings
there
is
the
signal
station
all
right
we
know
the
place
and
we
know
the
code
so
surely
our
task
should
be
simple
there
to
let
card
in
that
window
it
is
evidently
an
empty
flat
to
which
the
confederate
has
access
well
mrs
warren
what
now
have
it
all
ready
for
you
if
you
will
both
come
up
and
leave
your
boots
below
on
the
landing
ll
put
you
there
now
it
was
an
excellent
hiding
plate
which
she
had
arranged
the
mirror
was
so
placed
that
seated
in
the
dark
we
could
very
plainly
see
the
door
opposite
we
had
hardly
settled
down
in
it
and
mrs
warren
left
us
when
distant
tinkle
announced
that
our
mysterious
neighbour
had
rung
presently
the
landlady
appeared
with
the
tray
laid
it
down
upon
chair
beside
the
closed
door
and
then
treading
heavily
departed
crouching
together
in
the
angle
of
the
door
we
kept
our
eyes
fixed
upon
the
mirror
suddenly
as
the
landlady
footsteps
died
away
there
was
the
creak
of
turning
key
the
handle
revolved
and
two
thin
hands
darted
out
and
lifted
the
tray
form
the
chair
an
instant
later
it
was
hurriedly
replaced
and
caught
glimpse
of
dark
beautiful
horrified
face
glaring
at
the
narrow
opening
of
the
box
room
then
the
door
crashed
to
the
key
turned
once
more
and
all
was
silence
holmes
twitched
my
sleeve
and
together
we
stole
down
the
stair

will
call
again
in
the
evening
said
he
to
the
expectant
landlady
think
watson
we
can
discuss
this
business
better
in
our
own
quarters
my
surmise
as
you
saw
proved
to
be
correct
said
he
speaking
from
the
depths
of
his
easy
chair
there
has
been
substitution
of
lodgers
what
did
not
foresee
is
that
we
should
find
woman
and
no
ordinary
woman
watson
she
saw
us
well
she
saw
something
to
alarm
her
that
is
certain
the
general
sequence
of
events
is
pretty
clear
is
it
not
couple
seek
refuge
in
london
from
very
terrible
and
instant
danger
the
measure
of
that
danger
is
the
rigour
of
their
precautions
the
man
who
has
some
work
which
he
must
do
desires
to
leave
the
woman
in
absolute
safety
while
he
does
it
is
not
an
easy
problem
but
he
solved
it
in
an
original
fashion
and
so
effectively
that
her
presence
was
not
even
known
to
the
landlady
who
supplies
her
with
food
the
printed
messages
as
is
now
evident
were
to
prevent
her
sex
being
discovered
by
her
writing
the
man
cannot
come
near
the
woman
or
he
will
guide
their
enemies
to
her
since
he
cannot
communicate
with
her
direct
he
has
recourse
to
the
agony
column
of
paper
so
far
all
is
clear
but
what
is
at
the
root
of
it
ah
yes
watson
severely
practical
as
usual
what
is
at
the
root
of
it
all
mrs
warren
whimsical
problem
enlarges
somewhat
and
assumes
more
sinister
aspect
as
we
proceed
this
much
we
can
say
that
it
is
no
ordinary
love
escapade
you
saw
the
woman
face
at
the
sign
of
danger
we
have
heard
too
of
the
attack
upon
the
landlord
which
was
undoubtedly
meant
for
the
lodger
these
alarms
and
the
desperate
need
for
secrecy
argue
that
the
matter
is
one
of
life
or
death
the
attach
upon
mr
warren
further
shows
that
the
enemy
whoever
they
are
themselves
not
aware
of
the
substitution
of
the
female
lodger
for
the
male
it
is
very
curious
and
complex
watson
why
should
you
go
further
in
it
what
have
you
to
gain
from
it
what
indeed
it
is
art
for
art
sake
watson
suppose
when
you
doctored
you
found
yourself
studying
cases
without
thought
of
fee
for
my
education
holmes
education
never
ends
watson
it
is
series
of
lessons
with
the
greatest
for
the
last
this
is
an
instructive
case
there
is
neither
money
nor
credit
in
it
and
yet
one
would
wish
to
tidy
it
up
when
dusk
comes
we
should
find
ourselves
one
stage
advanced
in
our
investigation
when
we
returned
to
mrs
warren
rooms
the
gloom
of
london
winter
evening
had
thickened
into
one
grey
curtain
dead
monotone
of
colour
broken
only
by
the
sharp
yellow
squares
of
the
windows
and
the
blurred
haloes
of
the
gas
lamps
as
we
peered
from
the
darkened
sitting
room
of
the
lodging
house
one
more
dim
light
glimmered
high
up
through
the
obscurity
someone
is
moving
in
that
room
said
holmes
in
whisper
his
gaunt
and
eager
face
thrust
forward
to
the
window
pane
yes
can
see
his
shadow
there
he
is
again
he
has
candle
in
his
hand
now
he
is
peering
across
he
wants
to
be
sure
that
she
is
on
the
lookout
now
he
begins
to
flash
take
the
message
also
watson
that
we
may
check
each
other
single
flash
that
is
surely
now
then
how
many
did
you
make
it
twenty
do
did
in
that
should
mean
at
that
intelligible
enough
another
surely
this
is
the
beginning
of
second
word
now
then
tenta
dead
stop
that
can
be
all
watson
attenta
gives
no
sense
nor
is
it
any
better
as
three
words
at
ten
ta
unless
are
person
initials
there
it
goes
again
what
that
atte
why
it
is
the
same
message
over
again
curious
watson
very
curious
now
he
is
off
once
more
at
why
he
is
repeating
it
for
the
third
time
attenta
three
times
how
often
will
he
repeat
it
no
that
seems
to
be
the
finish
he
has
withdrawn
form
the
window
what
do
you
make
of
it
watson
cipher
message
holmes
my
companion
gave
sudden
chuckle
of
comprehension
and
not
very
obscure
cipher
watson
said
he
why
of
course
it
is
italian
the
means
that
it
is
addressed
to
woman
beware
how
that
watson
believe
you
have
hit
it
not
doubt
of
it
is
very
urgent
message
thrice
repeated
to
make
it
more
so
but
beware
of
what
wait
bit
he
is
coming
to
the
window
once
more
again
we
saw
the
dim
silhouette
of
crouching
man
and
the
whisk
of
the
small
flame
across
the
window
as
the
signals
were
renewed
they
came
mor
rapidly
than
before
so
rapid
that
it
was
hard
to
follow
them
pericolo
eh
what
that
watson
danger
isn
it
yes
by
jove
it
danger
signal
there
he
goes
again
peri
halloa
what
on
earth—
the
light
had
suddenly
gone
out
the
glimmering
square
of
window
had
disappeared
and
the
third
floor
formed
dark
band
round
the
lofty
building
with
its
tiers
of
shining
casements
that
last
warning
cry
had
been
suddenly
cut
short
how
and
by
whom
the
same
thought
occurred
on
the
instant
to
us
both
holmes
sprang
up
from
where
he
crouched
by
the
window
this
is
serious
watson
he
cried
there
is
some
devilry
going
forward
why
should
such
message
stop
in
such
way
should
put
scotland
yard
in
touch
with
this
business
and
yet
it
is
too
pressing
for
us
to
leave
shall
go
for
the
police
we
must
define
the
situation
little
more
clearly
it
may
bear
some
more
innocent
interpretation
come
watson
let
us
go
across
ourselves
and
see
what
we
can
make
of
it
two
as
we
walked
rapidly
down
howe
street
glanced
back
at
the
building
which
we
had
left
there
dimly
outlined
at
the
top
window
could
see
the
shadow
of
head
woman
head
gazing
tensely
rigidly
out
into
the
night
waiting
with
breathless
suspense
for
the
renewal
of
that
interrupted
message
at
the
doorway
of
the
howe
street
flats
man
muffled
in
cravat
and
greatcoat
was
leaning
against
the
railing
he
started
as
the
hall
light
fell
upon
our
faces
holmes
he
cried
why
gregson
said
my
companion
as
he
shook
hands
with
the
scotland
yard
detective
journeys
end
with
lovers
meetings
what
brings
you
here
the
same
reasons
that
bring
you
expect
said
gregson
how
you
got
on
to
it
can
imagine
different
threads
but
leading
up
to
the
same
tangle
ve
been
taking
the
signals
yes
from
that
window
they
broke
off
in
the
middle
we
came
over
to
see
the
reason
but
since
it
is
safe
in
your
hands
see
no
object
in
continuing
this
business
wait
bit
cried
gregson
eagerly
ll
do
you
this
justice
mr
holmes
that
was
never
in
case
yet
that
didn
feel
stronger
for
having
you
on
my
side
there
only
the
one
exit
to
these
flats
so
we
have
him
safe
who
is
he
well
we
score
over
you
for
once
mr
holmes
you
must
give
us
best
this
time
he
struck
his
stick
sharply
upon
the
ground
on
which
cabman
his
whip
in
his
hand
sauntered
over
from
four
wheeler
which
stood
on
the
far
side
of
the
street
may
introduce
you
to
mr
sherlock
holmes
he
said
to
the
cabman
this
is
mr
leverton
of
pinkerton
american
agency
the
hero
of
the
long
island
cave
mystery
said
holmes
sir
am
pleased
to
meet
you
the
american
quiet
businesslike
young
man
with
cleanshaven
hatchet
face
flushed
up
at
the
words
of
commendation
am
on
the
trail
of
my
life
now
mr
holmes
said
he
if
can
get
gorgiano—
what
gorgiano
of
the
red
circle
oh
he
has
european
fame
has
he
well
we
ve
learned
all
about
him
in
america
we
know
he
is
at
the
bottom
of
fifty
murders
and
yet
we
have
nothing
positive
we
can
take
him
on
tracked
him
over
from
new
york
and
ve
been
close
to
him
for
week
in
london
waiting
some
excuse
to
get
my
hand
on
his
collar
mr
gregson
and
ran
him
to
ground
in
that
big
tenement
house
and
there
only
one
door
so
he
can
slip
us
there
three
folk
come
out
since
he
went
in
but
ll
swear
he
wasn
one
of
them
mr
holmes
talks
of
signals
said
gregson
expect
as
usual
he
knows
good
deal
that
we
don
in
few
clear
words
holmes
explained
the
situation
as
it
had
appeared
to
us
the
american
struck
his
hands
together
with
vexation
he
on
to
us
he
cried
why
do
you
think
so
well
it
figures
out
that
way
does
it
not
here
he
is
sending
out
messages
to
an
accomplice
there
are
several
of
his
gang
in
london
then
suddenly
just
as
by
your
own
account
he
was
telling
them
that
there
was
danger
he
broke
short
off
what
could
it
mean
except
that
from
the
window
he
had
suddenly
either
caught
sight
of
us
in
the
street
or
in
some
way
come
to
understand
how
close
the
danger
was
and
that
he
must
act
right
away
if
he
was
to
avoid
it
what
do
you
suggest
mr
holmes
that
we
go
up
at
once
and
see
for
ourselves
but
we
have
no
warrant
for
his
arrest
he
is
in
unoccupied
premises
under
suspicious
circumstances
said
gregson
that
is
good
enough
for
the
moment
when
we
have
him
by
the
heels
we
can
see
if
new
york
can
help
us
to
keep
him
ll
take
the
responsibility
of
arresting
him

our
official
detectives
may
blunder
in
the
matter
of
intelligence
but
never
in
that
of
courage
gregson
climbed
the
stair
to
arrest
this
desperate
murderer
with
the
same
absolutely
quiet
and
businesslike
bearing
with
which
he
would
have
ascended
the
official
staircase
of
scotland
yard
the
pinkerton
man
had
tried
to
push
past
him
but
gregson
had
firmly
elbowed
him
back
london
dangers
were
the
privilege
of
the
london
force
the
door
of
the
left
hand
flat
upon
the
third
landing
was
standing
ajar
gregson
pushed
it
open
within
all
was
absolute
silence
and
darkness
struck
match
and
lit
the
detective
lantern
as
did
so
and
as
the
flicker
steadied
into
flame
we
all
gave
gasp
of
surprise
on
the
deal
boards
of
the
carpetless
floor
there
was
outlined
fresh
track
of
blood
the
red
steps
pointed
towards
us
and
led
away
from
an
inner
room
the
door
of
which
was
closed
gregson
flung
it
open
and
held
his
light
full
blaze
in
front
of
him
while
we
all
peered
eagerly
over
his
shoulders
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
of
the
empty
room
was
huddled
the
figure
of
an
enormous
man
his
clean
shaven
swarthy
face
grotesquely
horrible
in
its
contortion
and
his
head
encircled
by
ghastly
crimson
halo
of
blood
lying
in
broad
wet
circle
upon
the
white
woodwork
his
knees
were
drawn
up
his
hands
thrown
out
in
agony
and
from
the
centre
of
his
broad
brown
upturned
throat
there
projected
the
white
haft
of
knife
driven
bladedeep
into
his
body
giant
as
he
was
the
man
must
have
gone
down
like
pole
axed
ox
before
that
terrific
blow
beside
his
right
hand
most
formidable
horn
handled
two
edged
dagger
lay
upon
the
floor
and
near
it
black
kid
glove
by
george
it
black
gorgiano
himself
cried
the
american
detective
someone
has
got
ahead
of
us
this
time
here
is
the
candle
in
the
window
mr
holmes
said
gregson
why
whatever
are
you
doing
holmes
had
stepped
across
had
lit
the
candle
and
was
passing
it
backward
and
forward
across
the
window
panes
then
he
peered
into
the
darkness
blew
the
candle
out
and
threw
it
on
the
floor
rather
think
that
will
be
helpful
said
he
came
over
and
stood
in
deep
thought
while
the
two
professionals
were
examining
the
body
you
say
that
three
people
came
out
form
the
flat
while
you
were
waiting
downstairs
said
he
at
last
did
you
observe
them
closely
yes
did
was
there
fellow
about
thirty
black
bearded
dark
of
middle
size
yes
he
was
the
last
to
pass
me
that
is
your
man
fancy
can
give
you
his
description
and
we
have
very
excellent
outline
of
his
footmark
that
should
be
enough
for
you
not
much
mr
holmes
among
the
millions
of
london
perhaps
not
that
is
why
thought
it
best
to
summon
this
lady
to
your
aid
we
all
turned
round
at
the
words
there
framed
in
the
doorway
was
tall
and
beautiful
woman
the
mysterious
lodger
of
bloomsbury
slowly
she
advanced
her
face
pale
and
drawn
with
frightful
apprehension
her
eyes
fixed
and
staring
her
terrified
gaze
riveted
upon
the
dark
figure
on
the
floor
you
have
killed
him
she
muttered
oh
dio
mio
you
have
killed
him
then
heard
sudden
sharp
intake
of
her
breath
and
she
sprang
into
the
air
with
cry
of
joy
round
and
round
the
room
she
danced
her
hands
clapping
her
dark
eyes
gleaming
with
delighted
wonder
and
thousand
pretty
italian
exclamations
pouring
from
her
lips
it
was
terrible
and
amazing
to
see
such
woman
so
convulsed
with
joy
at
such
sight
suddenly
she
stopped
and
gazed
at
us
all
with
questioning
stare
but
you
are
police
are
you
not
you
have
killed
giuseppe
gorgiano
is
it
not
so
we
are
police
madam
she
looked
round
into
the
shadows
of
the
room
but
where
then
is
gennaro
she
asked
he
is
my
husband
gennaro
lucca
am
emilia
lucca
and
we
are
both
from
new
york
where
is
gennaro
he
called
me
this
moment
from
this
window
and
ran
with
all
my
speed
it
was
who
called
said
holmes
you
how
could
you
call
your
cipher
was
not
difficult
madam
your
presence
here
was
desirable
knew
that
had
only
to
flash
vieni
and
you
would
surely
come
the
beautiful
italian
looked
with
awe
at
my
companion
do
not
understand
how
you
know
these
things
she
said
giuseppe
gorgiano
how
did
he—
she
paused
and
then
suddenly
her
face
lit
up
with
pride
and
delight
now
see
it
my
gennaro
my
splendid
beautiful
gennaro
who
has
guarded
me
safe
from
all
harm
he
did
it
with
his
own
strong
hand
he
killed
the
monster
oh
gennaro
how
wonderful
you
are
what
woman
could
every
be
worthy
of
such
man
well
mrs
lucca
said
the
prosaic
gregson
laying
his
hand
upon
the
lady
sleeve
with
as
little
sentiment
as
if
she
were
notting
hill
hooligan
am
not
very
clear
yet
who
you
are
or
what
you
are
but
you
ve
said
enough
to
make
it
very
clear
that
we
shall
want
you
at
the
yard
one
moment
gregson
said
holmes
rather
fancy
that
this
lady
may
be
as
anxious
to
give
us
information
as
we
can
be
to
get
it
you
understand
madam
that
your
husband
will
be
arrested
and
tried
for
the
death
of
the
man
who
lies
before
us
what
you
say
may
be
used
in
evidence
but
if
you
think
that
he
has
acted
from
motives
which
are
not
criminal
and
which
he
would
wish
to
have
known
then
you
cannot
serve
him
better
than
by
telling
us
the
whole
story
now
that
gorgiano
is
dead
we
fear
nothing
said
the
lady
he
was
devil
and
monster
and
there
can
be
no
judge
in
the
world
who
would
punish
my
husband
for
having
killed
him
in
that
case
said
holmes
my
suggestion
is
that
we
lock
this
door
leave
things
as
we
found
them
go
with
this
lady
to
her
room
and
form
our
opinion
after
we
have
heard
what
it
is
that
she
has
to
say
to
us
half
an
hour
later
we
were
seated
all
four
in
the
small
sitting
room
of
signora
lucca
listening
to
her
remarkable
narrative
of
those
sinister
events
the
ending
of
which
we
had
chanced
to
witness
she
spoke
in
rapid
and
fluent
but
very
unconventional
english
which
for
the
sake
of
clearness
will
make
grammatical
was
born
in
posilippo
near
naples
said
she
and
was
the
daughter
of
augusto
barelli
who
was
the
chief
lawyer
and
once
the
deputy
of
that
part
gennaro
was
in
my
father
employment
and
came
to
love
him
as
any
woman
must
he
had
neither
money
nor
position
nothing
but
his
beauty
and
strength
and
energy
so
my
father
forbade
the
match
we
fled
together
were
married
at
bari
and
sold
my
jewels
to
gain
the
money
which
would
take
us
to
america
this
was
four
years
ago
and
we
have
been
in
new
york
ever
since
fortune
was
very
good
to
us
at
first
gennaro
was
able
to
do
service
to
an
italian
gentleman
he
saved
him
from
some
ruffians
in
the
place
called
the
bowery
and
so
made
powerful
friend
his
name
was
tito
castalotte
and
he
was
the
senior
partner
of
the
great
firm
of
castalotte
and
zamba
who
are
the
chief
fruit
importers
of
new
york
signor
zamba
is
an
invalid
and
our
new
friend
castalotte
has
all
power
within
the
firm
which
employs
more
than
three
hundred
men
he
took
my
husband
into
his
employment
made
him
head
of
department
and
showed
his
goodwill
towards
him
in
every
way
signor
castalotte
was
bachelor
and
believe
that
he
felt
as
if
gennaro
was
his
son
and
both
my
husband
and
loved
him
as
if
he
were
our
father
we
had
taken
and
furnished
little
house
in
brooklyn
and
our
whole
future
seemed
assured
when
that
black
cloud
appeared
which
was
soon
to
overspread
our
sky
one
night
when
gennaro
returned
from
his
work
he
brought
fellow
countryman
back
with
him
his
name
was
gorgiano
and
he
had
come
also
from
posilippo
he
was
huge
man
as
you
can
testify
for
you
have
looked
upon
his
corpse
not
only
was
his
body
that
of
giant
but
everything
about
him
was
grotesque
gigantic
and
terrifying
his
voice
was
like
thunder
in
our
little
house
there
was
scarce
room
for
the
whirl
of
his
great
arms
as
he
talked
his
thoughts
his
emotions
his
passions
all
were
exaggerated
and
monstrous
he
talked
or
rather
roared
with
such
energy
that
others
could
but
sit
and
listen
cowed
with
the
mighty
stream
of
words
his
eyes
blazed
at
you
and
held
you
at
his
mercy
he
was
terrible
and
wonderful
man
thank
god
that
he
is
dead
he
came
again
and
again
yet
was
aware
that
gennaro
was
no
more
happy
than
was
in
his
presence
my
poor
husband
would
sit
pale
and
listless
listening
to
the
endless
raving
upon
politics
and
upon
social
questions
which
made
up
or
visitor
conversation
gennaro
said
nothing
but
who
knew
him
so
well
could
read
in
his
face
some
emotion
which
had
never
seen
there
before
at
first
thought
that
it
was
dislike
and
then
gradually
understood
that
it
was
more
than
dislike
it
was
fear
deep
secret
shrinking
fear
that
night
the
night
that
read
his
terror
put
my
arms
round
him
and
implored
him
by
his
love
for
me
and
by
all
that
he
held
dear
to
hold
nothing
from
me
and
to
tell
me
why
this
huge
man
overshadowed
him
so

he
told
me
and
my
own
heart
grew
cold
as
ice
as
listened
my
poor
gennaro
in
his
wild
and
fiery
days
when
all
the
world
seemed
against
him
and
his
mind
was
driven
half
mad
by
the
injustices
of
life
had
joint
neapolitan
society
the
red
circle
which
was
allied
to
the
old
carbonari
the
oaths
and
secrets
of
this
brotherhood
were
frightful
but
once
within
its
rule
no
escape
was
possible
when
we
had
fled
to
america
gennaro
thought
that
he
had
cast
it
all
off
forever
what
was
his
horror
one
evening
to
meet
in
the
streets
the
very
man
who
had
initiated
him
in
naples
the
giant
gorgiano
man
who
had
earned
the
name
of
death
in
the
south
of
italy
for
he
was
red
to
the
elbow
in
murder
he
had
come
to
new
york
to
avoid
the
italian
police
and
he
had
already
planted
branch
of
this
dreadful
society
in
his
new
home
all
this
gennaro
told
me
and
showed
me
summons
which
he
had
received
that
very
day
red
circle
drawn
upon
the
head
of
it
telling
him
that
lodge
would
be
held
upon
certain
date
and
that
his
presence
at
it
was
required
and
ordered
that
was
bad
enough
but
worse
was
to
come
had
noticed
for
some
time
that
when
gorgiano
came
to
us
as
he
constantly
did
in
the
evening
he
spoke
much
to
me
and
even
when
his
words
were
to
my
husband
those
terrible
glaring
wild
beast
eyes
of
his
were
always
turned
upon
me
one
night
his
secret
came
out
had
awakened
what
he
called
love
within
him
the
love
of
brute
savage
gennaro
had
not
yet
returned
when
he
came
he
pushed
his
way
in
seized
me
in
his
mighty
arms
hugged
me
in
his
bear
embrace
covered
me
with
kisses
and
implored
me
to
come
away
with
him
was
struggling
and
screaming
when
gennaro
entered
and
attacked
him
he
struck
gennaro
senseless
and
fled
from
the
house
which
he
was
never
more
to
enter
it
was
deadly
enemy
that
we
made
that
night
few
days
later
came
the
meeting
gennaro
returned
from
it
with
face
which
told
me
that
something
dreadful
had
occurred
it
was
worse
than
we
could
have
imagined
possible
the
funds
of
the
society
were
raised
by
blackmailing
rich
italians
and
threatening
them
with
violence
should
they
refuse
the
money
it
seems
that
castalotte
our
dear
friend
and
benefactor
had
been
approached
he
had
refused
to
yield
to
threats
and
he
had
handed
the
notices
to
the
police
it
was
resolved
now
that
such
an
example
should
be
made
of
them
as
would
prevent
any
other
victim
from
rebelling
at
the
meeting
it
was
arranged
that
he
and
his
house
should
be
blown
up
with
dynamite
there
was
drawing
of
lots
as
to
who
should
carry
out
the
deed
gennaro
saw
our
enemy
cruel
face
smiling
at
him
as
he
dipped
his
hand
in
the
bag
no
doubt
it
had
been
prearranged
in
some
fashion
for
it
was
the
fatal
disc
with
the
red
circle
upon
it
the
mandate
for
murder
which
lay
upon
his
palm
he
was
to
kill
his
best
friend
or
he
was
to
expose
himself
and
me
to
the
vengeance
of
his
comrades
it
was
part
of
their
fiendish
system
to
punish
those
whom
they
feared
or
hated
by
injuring
not
only
their
own
persons
but
those
whom
they
loved
and
it
was
the
knowledge
of
this
which
hung
as
terror
over
my
poor
gennaro
head
and
drove
him
nearly
crazy
with
apprehension
all
that
night
we
sat
together
our
arms
round
each
other
each
strengthening
each
for
the
troubles
that
lay
before
us
the
very
next
evening
had
been
fixed
for
the
attempt
by
midday
my
husband
and
were
on
our
way
to
london
but
not
before
he
had
given
our
benefactor
full
warning
of
this
danger
and
had
also
left
such
information
for
the
police
as
would
safeguard
his
life
for
the
future
the
rest
gentlemen
you
know
for
yourselves
we
were
sure
that
our
enemies
would
be
behind
us
like
our
own
shadows
gorgiano
had
his
private
reasons
for
vengeance
but
in
any
case
we
knew
how
ruthless
cunning
and
untiring
he
could
be
both
italy
and
america
are
full
of
stories
of
his
dreadful
powers
if
ever
they
were
exerted
it
would
be
now
my
darling
made
use
of
the
few
clear
days
which
our
start
had
given
us
in
arranging
for
refuge
for
me
in
such
fashion
that
no
possible
danger
could
reach
me
for
his
own
part
he
wished
to
be
free
that
he
might
communicate
both
with
the
american
and
with
the
italian
police
do
not
myself
know
where
he
lived
or
how
all
that
learned
was
through
the
columns
of
newspaper
but
once
as
looked
through
my
window
saw
two
italians
watching
the
house
and
understood
that
in
some
way
gorgiano
had
found
our
retreat
finally
gennaro
told
me
through
the
paper
that
he
would
signal
to
me
from
certain
window
but
when
the
signals
came
they
were
nothing
but
warnings
which
were
suddenly
interrupted
it
is
very
clear
to
me
now
that
he
knew
gorgiano
to
be
close
upon
him
and
that
thank
god
he
was
ready
for
him
when
he
came
and
now
gentleman
would
ask
you
whether
we
have
anything
to
fear
from
the
law
or
whether
any
judge
upon
earth
would
condemn
my
gennaro
for
what
he
has
done
well
mr
gregson
said
the
american
looking
across
at
the
official
don
know
what
your
british
point
of
view
may
be
but
guess
that
in
new
york
this
lady
husband
will
receive
pretty
general
vote
of
thanks
she
will
have
to
come
with
me
and
see
the
chief
gregson
answered
if
what
she
says
is
corroborated
do
not
think
she
or
her
husband
has
much
to
fear
but
what
can
make
head
or
tail
of
mr
holmes
is
how
on
earth
you
got
yourself
mixed
up
in
the
matter
education
gregson
education
still
seeking
knowledge
at
the
old
university
well
watson
you
have
one
more
specimen
of
the
tragic
and
grotesque
to
add
to
your
collection
by
the
way
it
is
not
eight
clock
and
wagner
night
at
covent
garden
if
we
hurry
we
might
be
in
time
for
the
second
act
vi
the
disappearance
of
lady
frances
carfax
but
why
turkish
asked
mr
sherlock
holmes
gazing
fixedly
at
my
boots
was
reclining
in
cane
backed
chair
at
the
moment
and
my
protruded
feet
had
attracted
his
ever
active
attention
english
answered
in
some
surprise
got
them
at
latimer
in
oxford
street
holmes
smiled
with
an
expression
of
weary
patience
the
bath
he
said
the
bath
why
the
relaxing
and
expensive
turkish
rather
than
the
invigorating
home
made
article
because
for
the
last
few
days
have
been
feeling
rheumatic
and
old
turkish
bath
is
what
we
call
an
alterative
in
medicine
fresh
starting
point
cleanser
of
the
system
by
the
way
holmes
added
have
no
doubt
the
connection
between
my
boots
and
turkish
bath
is
perfectly
self
evident
one
to
logical
mind
and
yet
should
be
obliged
to
you
if
you
would
indicate
it
the
train
of
reasoning
is
not
very
obscure
watson
said
holmes
with
mischievous
twinkle
it
belongs
to
the
same
elementary
class
of
deduction
which
should
illustrate
if
were
to
ask
you
who
shared
your
cab
in
your
drive
this
morning
don
admit
that
fresh
illustration
is
an
explanation
said
with
some
asperity
bravo
watson
very
dignified
and
logical
remonstrance
let
me
see
what
were
the
points
take
the
last
one
first
the
cab
you
observe
that
you
have
some
splashes
on
the
left
sleeve
and
shoulder
of
your
coat
had
you
sat
in
the
centre
of
hansom
you
would
probably
have
had
no
splashes
and
if
you
had
they
would
certainly
have
been
symmetrical
therefore
it
is
clear
that
you
sat
at
the
side
therefore
it
is
equally
clear
that
you
had
companion
that
is
very
evident
absurdly
commonplace
is
it
not
but
the
boots
and
the

went
as
you
may
remember
in
the
male
line
she
was
left
with
limited
means
but
with
some
very
remarkable
old
spanish
jewellery
of
silver
and
curiously
cut
diamonds
to
which
she
was
fondly
attached
too
attached
for
she
refused
to
leave
them
with
her
banker
and
always
carried
them
about
with
her
rather
pathetic
figure
the
lady
frances
beautiful
woman
still
in
fresh
middle
age
and
yet
by
strange
change
the
last
derelict
of
what
only
twenty
years
ago
was
goodly
fleet
what
has
happened
to
her
then
ah
what
has
happened
to
the
lady
frances
is
she
alive
or
dead
there
is
our
problem
she
is
lady
of
precise
habits
and
for
four
years
it
has
been
her
invariable
custom
to
write
every
second
week
to
miss
dobney
her
old
governess
who
has
long
retired
and
lives
in
camberwell
it
is
this
miss
dobney
who
has
consulted
me
nearly
five
weeks
have
passed
without
word
the
last
letter
was
from
the
hotel
national
at
lausanne
lady
frances
seems
to
have
left
there
and
given
no
address
the
family
are
anxious
and
as
they
are
exceedingly
wealthy
no
sum
will
be
spared
if
we
can
clear
the
matter
up
is
miss
dobney
the
only
source
of
information
surely
she
had
other
correspondents
there
is
one
correspondent
who
is
sure
draw
watson
that
is
the
bank
single
ladies
must
live
and
their
passbooks
are
compressed
diaries
she
banks
at
silvester
have
glanced
over
her
account
the
last
check
but
one
paid
her
bill
at
lausanne
but
it
was
large
one
and
probably
left
her
with
cash
in
hand
only
one
check
has
been
drawn
since
to
whom
and
where
to
miss
marie
devine
there
is
nothing
to
show
where
the
check
was
drawn
it
was
cashed
at
the
credit
lyonnais
at
montpellier
less
than
three
weeks
ago
the
sum
was
fifty
pounds
and
who
is
miss
marie
devine
that
also
have
been
able
to
discover
miss
marie
devine
was
the
maid
of
lady
frances
carfax
why
she
should
have
paid
her
this
check
we
have
not
yet
determined
have
no
doubt
however
that
your
researches
will
soon
clear
the
matter
up
my
researches
hence
the
health
giving
expedition
to
lausanne
you
know
that
cannot
possibly
leave
london
while
old
abrahams
is
in
such
mortal
terror
of
his
life
besides
on
general
principles
it
is
best
that
should
not
leave
the
country
scotland
yard
feels
lonely
without
me
and
it
causes
an
unhealthy
excitement
among
the
criminal
classes

my
humble
counsel
can
ever
be
valued
at
so
extravagant
rate
as

night
and
day
at
the
end
of
the
continental
wire
two
days
later
found
me
at
the
hotel
national
at
lausanne
where
received
every
courtesy
at
the
hands
of
moser
the
wellknown
manager
lady
frances
as
he
informed
me
had
stayed
there
for
several
weeks
she
had
been
much
liked
by
all
who
met
her
age
was
not
more
than
forty
she
was
still
handsome
and
bore
every
sign
of
having
in
her
youth
been
very
lovely
woman
moser
knew
nothing
of
any
valuable
jewellery
but
it
had
been
remarked
by
the
servants
that
the
heavy
trunk
in
the
lady
bedroom
was
always
scrupulously
locked
marie
devine
the
maid
was
as
popular
as
her
mistress
she
was
actually
engaged
to
one
of
the
head
waiters
in
the
hotel
and
there
was
no
difficulty
in
getting
her
address
it
was
11
rue
de
trajan
montpellier
all
this
jotted
down
and
felt
that
holmes
himself
could
not
have
been
more
adroit
in
collecting
his
facts
only
one
corner
still
remained
in
the
shadow
no
light
which
possessed
could
clear
up
the
cause
for
the
lady
sudden
departure
she
was
very
happy
at
lausanne
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
that
she
intended
to
remain
for
the
season
in
her
luxurious
rooms
overlooking
the
lake
and
yet
she
had
left
at
single
day
notice
which
involved
her
in
the
useless
payment
of
week
rent
only
jules
vibart
the
lover
of
the
maid
had
any
suggestion
to
offer
he
connected
the
sudden
departure
with
the
visit
to
the
hotel
day
or
two
before
of
tall
dark
bearded
man
un
sauvage
un
veritable
sauvage
cried
jules
vibart
the
man
had
rooms
somewhere
in
the
town
he
had
been
seen
talking
earnestly
to
madame
on
the
promenade
by
the
lake
then
he
had
called
she
had
refused
to
see
him
he
was
english
but
of
his
name
there
was
no
record
madame
had
left
the
place
immediately
afterwards
jules
vibart
and
what
was
of
more
importance
jules
vibart
sweetheart
thought
that
this
call
and
the
departure
were
cause
and
effect
only
one
thing
jules
would
not
discuss
that
was
the
reason
why
marie
had
left
her
mistress
of
that
he
could
or
would
say
nothing
if
wished
to
know
must
go
to
montpellier
and
ask
her
so
ended
the
first
chapter
of
my
inquiry
the
second
was
devoted
to
the
place
which
lady
frances
carfax
had
sought
when
she
left
lausanne
concerning
this
there
had
been
some
secrecy
which
confirmed
the
idea
that
she
had
gone
with
the
intention
of
throwing
someone
off
her
track
otherwise
why
should
not
her
luggage
have
been
openly
labelled
for
baden
both
she
and
it
reached
the
rhenish
spa
by
some
circuitous
route
this
much
gathered
from
the
manager
of
cook
local
office
so
to
baden
went
after
dispatching
to
holmes
an
account
of
all
my
proceedings
and
receiving
in
reply
telegram
of
half
humorous
commendation
at
baden
the
track
was
not
difficult
to
follow
lady
frances
had
stayed
at
the
englischer
hof
for
fortnight
while
there
she
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
dr
shlessinger
and
his
wife
missionary
from
south
america
like
most
lonely
ladies
lady
frances
found
her
comfort
and
occupation
in
religion
dr
shlessinger
remarkable
personality
his
whole
hearted
devotion
and
the
fact
that
he
was
recovering
from
disease
contracted
in
the
exercise
of
his
apostolic
duties
affected
her
deeply
she
had
helped
mrs
shlessinger
in
the
nursing
of
the
convalescent
saint
he
spent
his
day
as
the
manager
described
it
to
me
upon
lounge
chair
on
the
veranda
with
an
attendant
lady
upon
either
side
of
him
he
was
preparing
map
of
the
holy
land
with
special
reference
to
the
kingdom
of
the
midianites
upon
which
he
was
writing
monograph
finally
having
improved
much
in
health
he
and
his
wife
had
returned
to
london
and
lady
frances
had
started
thither
in
their
company
this
was
just
three
weeks
before
and
the
manager
had
heard
nothing
since
as
to
the
maid
marie
she
had
gone
off
some
days
beforehand
in
floods
of
tears
after
informing
the
other
maids
that
she
was
leaving
service
forever
dr
shlessinger
had
paid
the
bill
of
the
whole
party
before
his
departure
by
the
way
said
the
landlord
in
conclusion
you
are
not
the
only
friend
of
lady
frances
carfax
who
is
inquiring
after
her
just
now
only
week
or
so
ago
we
had
man
here
upon
the
same
errand
did
he
give
name
asked
none
but
he
was
an
englishman
though
of
an
unusual
type
savage
said
linking
my
facts
after
the
fashion
of
my
illustrious
friend
exactly
that
describes
him
very
well
he
is
bulky
bearded
sunburned
fellow
who
looks
as
if
he
would
be
more
at
home
in
farmers
inn
than
in
fashionable
hotel
hard
fierce
man
should
think
and
one
whom
should
be
sorry
to
offend
already
the
mystery
began
to
define
itself
as
figures
grow
clearer
with
the
lifting
of
fog
here
was
this
good
and
pious
lady
pursued
from
place
to
place
by
sinister
and
unrelenting
figure
she
feared
him
or
she
would
not
have
fled
from
lausanne
he
had
still
followed
sooner
or
later
he
would
overtake
her
had
he
already
overtaken
her
was
that
the
secret
of
her
continued
silence
could
the
good
people
who
were
her
companions
not
screen
her
from
his
violence
or
his
blackmail
what
horrible
purpose
what
deep
design
lay
behind
this
long
pursuit
there
was
the
problem
which
had
to
solve
to
holmes
wrote
showing
how
rapidly
and
surely
had
got
down
to
the
roots
of
the
matter
in
reply
had
telegram
asking
for
description
of
dr
shlessinger
left
ear
holmes
ideas
of
humour
are
strange
and
occasionally
offensive
so
took
no
notice
of
his
ill
timed
jest
indeed
had
already
reached
montpellier
in
my
pursuit
of
the
maid
marie
before
his
message
came
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
ex
servant
and
in
learning
all
that
she
could
tell
me
she
was
devoted
creature
who
had
only
left
her
mistress
because
she
was
sure
that
she
was
in
good
hands
and
because
her
own
approaching
marriage
made
separation
inevitable
in
any
case
her
mistress
had
as
she
confessed
with
distress
shown
some
irritability
of
temper
towards
her
during
their
stay
in
baden
and
had
even
questioned
her
once
as
if
she
had
suspicions
of
her
honesty
and
this
had
made
the
parting
easier
than
it
would
otherwise
have
been
lady
frances
had
given
her
fifty
pounds
as
wedding
present
like
me
marie
viewed
with
deep
distrust
the
stranger
who
had
driven
her
mistress
from
lausanne
with
her
own
eyes
she
had
seen
him
seize
the
lady
wrist
with
great
violence
on
the
public
promenade
by
the
lake
he
was
fierce
and
terrible
man
she
believed
that
it
was
out
of
dread
of
him
that
lady
frances
had
accepted
the
escort
of
the
shlessingers
to
london
she
had
never
spoken
to
marie
about
it
but
many
little
signs
had
convinced
the
maid
that
her
mistress
lived
in
state
of
continual
nervous
apprehension
so
far
she
had
got
in
her
narrative
when
suddenly
she
sprang
from
her
chair
and
her
face
was
convulsed
with
surprise
and
fear
see
she
cried
the
miscreant
follows
still
there
is
the
very
man

through
the
open
sitting
room
window
saw
huge
swarthy
man
with
bristling
black
beard
walking
slowly
down
the
centre
of
the
street
and
staring
eagerly
at
he
numbers
of
the
houses
it
was
clear
that
like
myself
he
was
on
the
track
of
the
maid
acting
upon
the
impulse
of
the
moment
rushed
out
and
accosted
him
you
are
an
englishman
said
what
if
am
he
asked
with
most
villainous
scowl
may
ask
what
your
name
is
no
you
may
not
said
he
with
decision
the
situation
was
awkward
but
the
most
direct
way
is
often
the
best
where
is
the
lady
frances
carfax
asked
he
stared
at
me
with
amazement
what
have
you
done
with
her
why
have
you
pursued
her
insist
upon
an
answer
said
the
fellow
gave
below
of
anger
and
sprang
upon
me
like
tiger
have
held
my
own
in
many
struggle
but
the
man
had
grip
of
iron
and
the
fury
of
fiend
his
hand
was
on
my
throat
and
my
senses
were
nearly
gone
before
an
unshaven
french
ouvrier
in
blue
blouse
darted
out
from
cabaret
opposite
with
cudgel
in
his
hand
and
struck
my
assailant
sharp
crack
over
the
forearm
which
made
him
leave
go
his
hold
he
stood
for
an
instant
fuming
with
rage
and
uncertain
whether
he
should
not
renew
his
attack
then
with
snarl
of
anger
he
left
me
and
entered
the
cottage
from
which
had
just
come
turned
to
thank
my
preserver
who
stood
beside
me
in
the
roadway
well
watson
said
he
very
pretty
hash
you
have
made
of
it
rather
think
you
had
better
come
back
with
me
to
london
by
the
night
express
an
hour
afterwards
sherlock
holmes
in
his
usual
garb
and
style
was
seated
in
my
private
room
at
the
hotel
his
explanation
of
his
sudden
and
opportune
appearance
was
simplicity
itself
for
finding
that
he
could
get
away
from
london
he
determined
to
head
me
off
at
the
next
obvious
point
of
my
travels
in
the
disguise
of
workingman
he
had
sat
in
the
cabaret
waiting
for
my
appearance
and
singularly
consistent
investigation
you
have
made
my
dear
watson
said
he
cannot
at
the
moment
recall
any
possible
blunder
which
you
have
omitted
the
total
effect
of
your
proceeding
has
been
to
give
the
alarm
everywhere
and
yet
to
discover
nothing
perhaps
you
would
have
done
no
better
answered
bitterly
there
is
no
perhaps
about
it
have
done
better
here
is
the
hon
philip
green
who
is
fellow
lodger
with
you
in
this
hotel
and
we
may
find
him
the
starting
point
for
more
successful
investigation
card
had
come
up
on
salver
and
it
was
followed
by
the
same
bearded
ruffian
who
had
attacked
me
in
the
street
he
started
when
he
saw
me
what
is
this
mr
holmes
he
asked
had
your
note
and
have
come
but
what
has
this
man
to
do
with
the
matter
this
is
my
old
friend
and
associate
dr
watson
who
is
helping
us
in
this
affair
the
stranger
held
out
huge
sunburned
hand
with
few
words
of
apology
hope
didn
harm
you
when
you
accused
me
of
hurting
her
lost
my
grip
of
myself
indeed
not
responsible
in
these
days
my
nerves
are
like
live
wires
but
this
situation
is
beyond
me
what
want
to
know
in
the
first
place
mr
holmes
is
how
in
the
world
you
came
to
hear
of
my
existence
at
all
am
in
touch
with
miss
dobney
lady
frances
governess
old
susan
dobney
with
the
mob
cap
remember
her
well
and
she
remembers
you
it
was
in
the
days
before
you
found
it
better
to
go
to
south
africa
ah
see
you
know
my
whole
story
need
hide
nothing
from
you
swear
to
you
mr
holmes
that
there
never
was
in
this
world
man
who
loved
woman
with
more
wholehearted
love
than
had
for
frances
was
wild
youngster
know
not
worse
than
others
of
my
class
but
her
mind
was
pure
as
snow
she
could
not
bear
shadow
of
coarseness
so
when
she
came
to
hear
of
things
that
had
done
she
would
have
no
more
to
say
to
me
and
yet
she
loved
me
that
is
the
wonder
of
it
loved
me
well
enough
to
remain
single
all
her
sainted
days
just
for
my
sake
alone
when
the
years
had
passed
and
had
made
my
money
at
barberton
thought
perhaps
could
seek
her
out
and
soften
her
had
heard
that
she
was
still
unmarried
found
her
at
lausanne
and
tried
all
knew
she
weakened
think
but
her
will
was
strong
and
when
next
called
she
had
left
the
town
traced
her
to
baden
and
then
after
time
heard
that
her
maid
was
here
rough
fellow
fresh
from
rough
life
and
when
dr
watson
spoke
to
me
as
he
did
lost
hold
of
myself
for
moment
but
for
god
sake
tell
me
what
has
become
of
the
lady
frances
that
is
for
us
to
find
out
said
sherlock
holmes
with
peculiar
gravity
what
is
your
london
address
mr
green
the
langham
hotel
will
find
me
then
may
recommend
that
you
return
there
and
be
on
hand
in
case
should
want
you
have
no
desire
to
encourage
false
hopes
but
you
may
rest
assured
that
all
that
can
be
done
will
be
done
for
the
safety
of
lady
frances
can
say
no
more
for
the
instant
will
leave
you
this
card
so
that
you
may
be
able
to
keep
in
touch
with
us
now
watson
if
you
will
pack
your
bag
will
cable
to
mrs
hudson
to
make
one
of
her
best
efforts
for
two
hungry
travellers
at
30
to
morrow
telegram
was
awaiting
us
when
we
reached
our
baker
street
rooms
which
holmes
read
with
an
exclamation
of
interest
and
threw
across
to
me
jagged
or
torn
was
the
message
and
the
place
of
origin
baden
what
is
this
asked
it
is
everything
holmes
answered
you
may
remember
my
seemingly
irrelevant
question
as
to
this
clerical
gentleman
left
ear
you
did
not
answer
it
had
left
baden
and
could
not
inquire
exactly
for
this
reason
sent
duplicate
to
the
manager
of
the
englischer
hof
whose
answer
lies
here
what
does
it
show
it
shows
my
dear
watson
that
we
are
dealing
with
an
exceptionally
astute
and
dangerous
man
the
rev
dr
shlessinger
missionary
from
south
america
is
none
other
than
holy
peters
one
of
the
most
unscrupulous
rascals
that
australia
has
ever
evolved
and
for
young
country
it
has
turned
out
some
very
finished
types
his
particular
specialty
is
the
beguiling
of
lonely
ladies
by
playing
upon
their
religious
feelings
and
his
so
called
wife
an
englishwoman
named
fraser
is
worthy
helpmate
the
nature
of
his
tactics
suggested
his
identity
to
me
and
this
physical
peculiarity
he
was
badly
bitten
in
saloon
fight
at
adelaide
in
89—confirmed
my
suspicion
this
poor
lady
is
in
the
hands
of
most
infernal
couple
who
will
stick
at
nothing
watson
that
she
is
already
dead
is
very
likely
supposition
if
not
she
is
undoubtedly
in
some
sort
of
confinement
and
unable
to
write
to
miss
dobney
or
her
other
friends
it
is
always
possible
that
she
never
reached
london
or
that
she
has
passed
through
it
but
the
former
is
improbable
as
with
their
system
of
registration
it
is
not
easy
for
foreigners
to
play
tricks
with
the
continental
police
and
the
latter
is
also
unlikely
as
these
rouges
could
not
hope
to
find
any
other
place
where
it
would
be
as
easy
to
keep
person
under
restraint
all
my
instincts
tell
me
that
she
is
in
london
but
as
we
have
at
present
no
possible
means
of
telling
where
we
can
only
take
the
obvious
steps
eat
our
dinner
and
possess
our
souls
in
patience
later
in
the
evening
will
stroll
down
and
have
word
with
friend
lestrade
at
scotland
yard
but
neither
the
official
police
nor
holmes
own
small
but
very
efficient
organization
sufficed
to
clear
away
the
mystery
amid
the
crowded
millions
of
london
the
three
persons
we
sought
were
as
completely
obliterated
as
if
they
had
never
lived
advertisements
were
tried
and
failed
clues
were
followed
and
led
to
nothing
every
criminal
resort
which
shlessinger
might
frequent
was
drawn
in
vain
his
old
associates
were
watched
but
they
kept
clear
of
him
and
then
suddenly
after
week
of
helpless
suspense
there
came
flash
of
light
silver
andbrilliant
pendant
of
old
spanish
design
had
been
pawned
at
bovington
in
westminster
road
the
pawner
was
large
cleanshaven
man
of
clerical
appearance
his
name
and
address
were
demonstrably
false
the
ear
had
escaped
notice
but
the
description
was
surely
that
of
shlessinger
three
times
had
our
bearded
friend
from
the
langham
called
for
news
the
third
time
within
an
hour
of
this
fresh
development
his
clothes
were
getting
looser
on
his
great
body
he
seemed
to
be
wilting
away
in
his
anxiety
if
you
will
only
give
me
something
to
do
was
his
constant
wail
at
last
holmes
could
oblige
him
he
has
begun
to
pawn
the
jewels
we
should
get
him
now
but
does
this
mean
that
any
harm
has
befallen
the
lady
frances
holmes
shook
his
head
very
gravely
supposing
that
they
have
held
her
prisoner
up
to
now
it
is
clear
that
they
cannot
let
her
loose
without
their
own
destruction
we
must
prepare
for
the
worst
what
can
do

these
people
do
not
know
you
by
sight
no
it
is
possible
that
he
will
go
to
some
other
pawnbroker
in
the
future
in
that
case
we
must
begin
again
on
the
other
hand
he
has
had
fair
price
and
no
questions
asked
so
if
he
is
in
need
of
ready
money
he
will
probably
come
back
to
bovington
will
give
you
note
to
them
and
they
will
let
you
wait
in
the
shop
if
the
fellow
comes
you
will
follow
him
home
but
no
indiscretion
and
above
all
no
violence
put
you
on
your
honour
that
you
will
take
no
step
without
my
knowledge
and
consent
for
two
days
the
hon
philip
green
he
was
may
mention
the
son
of
the
famous
admiral
of
that
name
who
commanded
the
sea
of
azof
fleet
in
the
crimean
war
brought
us
no
news
on
the
evening
of
the
third
he
rushed
into
our
sitting
room
pale
trembling
with
every
muscle
of
his
powerful
frame
quivering
with
excitement
we
have
him
we
have
him
he
cried
he
was
incoherent
in
his
agitation
holmes
soothed
him
with
few
words
and
thrust
him
into
an
armchair
come
now
give
us
the
order
of
events
said
he
she
came
only
an
hour
ago
it
was
the
wife
this
time
but
the
pendant
she
brought
was
the
fellow
of
the
other
she
is
tall
pale
woman
with
ferret
eyes
that
is
the
lady
said
holmes
she
left
the
office
and
followed
her
she
walked
up
the
kennington
road
and
kept
behind
her
presently
she
went
into
shop
mr
holmes
it
was
an
undertaker
my
companion
started
well
he
asked
in
that
vibrant
voice
which
told
of
the
fiery
soul
behind
the
cold
grey
face
she
was
talking
to
the
woman
behind
the
counter
entered
as
well
it
is
late
heard
her
say
or
words
to
that
effect
the
woman
was
excusing
herself
it
should
be
there
before
now
she
answered
it
took
longer
being
out
of
the
ordinary
they
both
stopped
and
looked
at
me
so
asked
some
questions
and
then
left
the
shop
you
did
excellently
well
what
happened
next
the
woman
came
out
but
had
hid
myself
in
doorway
her
suspicions
had
been
aroused
think
for
she
looked
round
her
then
she
called
cab
and
got
in
was
lucky
enough
to
get
another
and
so
to
follow
her
she
got
down
at
last
at
no
36
poultney
square
brixton
drove
past
left
my
cab
at
the
corner
of
the
square
and
watched
the
house
did
you
see
anyone
the
windows
were
all
in
darkness
save
one
on
the
lower
floor
the
blind
was
down
and
could
not
see
in
was
standing
there
wondering
what
should
do
next
when
covered
van
drove
up
with
two
men
in
it
they
descended
took
something
out
of
the
van
and
carried
it
up
the
steps
to
the
hall
door
mr
holmes
it
was
coffin
ah
for
an
instant
was
on
the
point
of
rushing
in
the
door
had
been
opened
to
admit
the
men
and
their
burden
it
was
the
woman
who
had
opened
it
but
as
stood
there
she
caught
glimpse
of
me
and
think
that
she
recognized
me
saw
her
start
and
she
hastily
closed
the
door
remembered
my
promise
to
you
and
here
am
you
have
done
excellent
work
said
holmes
scribbling
few
words
upon
half
sheet
of
paper
we
can
do
nothing
legal
without
warrant
and
you
can
serve
the
cause
best
by
taking
this
note
down
to
the
authorities
and
getting
one
there
may
be
some
difficulty
but
should
think
that
the
sale
of
the
jewellery
should
be
sufficient
lestrade
will
see
to
all
details
but
they
may
murder
her
in
the
meanwhile
what
could
the
coffin
mean
and
for
whom
could
it
be
but
for
her
we
will
do
all
that
can
be
done
mr
green
not
moment
will
be
lost
leave
it
in
our
hands
now
watson
he
added
as
our
client
hurried
away
he
will
set
the
regular
forces
on
the
move
we
are
as
usual
the
irregulars
and
we
must
take
our
own
line
of
action
the
situation
strikes
me
as
so
desperate
that
the
most
extreme
measures
are
justified
not
moment
is
to
be
lost
in
getting
to
poultney
square
let
us
try
to
reconstruct
the
situation
said
he
as
we
drove
swiftly
past
the
houses
of
parliament
and
over
westminster
bridge
these
villains
have
coaxed
this
unhappy
lady
to
london
after
first
alienating
her
from
her
faithful
maid
if
she
has
written
any
letters
they
have
been
intercepted
through
some
confederate
they
have
engaged
furnished
house
once
inside
it
they
have
made
her
prisoner
and
they
have
become
possessed
of
the
valuable
jewellery
which
has
been
their
object
from
the
first
already
they
have
begun
to
sell
part
of
it
which
seems
safe
enough
to
them
since
they
have
no
reason
to
think
that
anyone
is
interested
in
the
lady
fate
when
she
is
released
she
will
of
course
denounce
them
therefore
she
must
not
be
released
but
they
cannot
keep
her
under
lock
and
key
forever
so
murder
is
their
only
solution
that
seems
very
clear
now
we
will
take
another
line
of
reasoning
when
you
follow
two
deparate
chains
of
thought
watson
you
will
find
some
point
of
intersection
which
should
approximate
to
the
truth
we
will
start
now
not
from
the
lady
but
from
the
coffin
and
argue
backward
that
incident
proves
fear
beyond
all
doubt
that
the
lady
is
dead
it
points
also
to
an
orthodox
burial
with
proper
accompaniment
of
medical
certificate
and
official
sanction
had
the
lady
been
obviously
murdered
they
would
have
buried
her
in
hole
in
the
back
garden
but
here
all
is
open
and
regular
what
does
this
mean
surely
that
they
have
done
her
to
death
in
some
way
which
has
deceived
the
doctor
and
simulated
natural
end
poisoning
perhaps
and
yet
how
strange
that
they
should
ever
let
doctor
approach
her
unless
he
were
confederate
which
is
hardly
credible
proposition
could
they
have
forged
medical
certificate
dangerous
watson
very
dangerous
no
hardly
see
them
doing
that
pull
up
cabby
this
is
evidently
the
undertaker
for
we
have
just
passed
the
pawnbroker
would
go
in
watson
your
appearance
inspires
confidence
ask
what
hour
the
poultney
square
funeral
takes
place
to
morrow
the
woman
in
the
shop
answered
me
without
hesitation
that
it
was
to
be
at
eight
clock
in
the
morning
you
see
watson
no
mystery
everything
above
board
in
some
way
the
legal
forms
have
undoubtedly
been
complied
with
and
they
think
that
they
have
little
to
fear
well
there
nothing
for
it
now
but
direct
frontal
attack
are
you
armed
my
stick
well
we
shall
be
strong
enough
thrice
is
he
armed
who
hath
his
quarrel
just
we
simply
can
afford
to
wait
for
the
police
or
to
keep
within
the
four
corners
of
the
law
you
can
drive
off
cabby
now
watson
we
ll
just
take
our
luck
together
as
we
have
occasionally
in
the
past
he
had
rung
loudly
at
the
door
of
great
dark
house
in
the
centre
of
poultney
square
it
was
opened
immediately
and
the
figure
of
tall
woman
was
outlined
against
the
dim
lit
hall
well
what
do
you
want
she
asked
sharply
peering
at
us
through
the
darkness
want
to
speak
to
dr
shlessinger
said
holmes
there
is
no
such
person
here
she
answered
and
tried
to
close
the
door
but
holmes
had
jammed
it
with
his
foot
well
want
to
see
the
man
who
lives
here
whatever
he
may
call
himself
said
holmes
firmly
she
hesitated
then
she
threw
open
the
door
well
come
in
said
she
my
husband
is
not
afraid
to
face
any
man
in
the
world
she
closed
the
door
behind
us
and
showed
us
into
sitting
room
on
the
right
side
of
the
hall
turning
up
the
gas
as
she
left
us
mr
peters
will
be
with
you
in
an
instant
she
said
her
words
were
literally
true
for
we
had
hardly
time
to
look
around
the
dusty
and
moth
eaten
apartment
in
which
we
found
ourselves
before
the
door
opened
and
big
clean
shaven
baldheaded
man
stepped
lightly
into
the
room
he
had
large
red
face
with
pendulous
cheeks
and
general
air
of
superficial
benevolence
which
was
marred
by
cruel
vicious
mouth
there
is
surely
some
mistake
here
gentlemen
he
said
in
an
unctuous
make
everything
easy
voice
fancy
that
you
have
been
misdirected
possibly
if
you
tried
farther
down
the
street
that
will
do
we
have
no
time
to
waste
said
my
companion
firmly
you
are
henry
peters
of
adelaide
late
the
rev
dr
shlessinger
of
baden
and
south
america
am
as
sure
of
that
as
that
my
own
name
is
sherlock
holmes
peters
as
will
now
call
him
started
and
stared
hard
at
his
formidable
pursuer
guess
your
name
does
not
frighten
me
mr
holmes
said
he
coolly
when
man
conscience
is
easy
you
can
rattle
him
what
is
your
business
in
my
house
want
to
know
what
you
have
done
with
the
lady
frances
carfax
whom
you
brought
away
with
you
from
baden
be
very
glad
if
you
could
tell
me
where
that
lady
may
be
peters
answered
coolly
ve
bill
against
her
for
nearly
hundred
pounds
and
nothing
to
show
for
it
but
couple
of
trumpery
pendants
that
the
dealer
would
hardly
look
at
she
attached
herself
to
mrs
peters
and
me
at
baden
it
is
fact
that
was
using
another
name
at
the
time
and
she
stuck
on
to
us
until
we
came
to
london
paid
her
bill
and
her
ticket
once
in
london
she
gave
us
the
slip
and
as
say
left
these
outof
date
jewels
to
pay
her
bills
you
find
her
mr
holmes
and
your
debtor

in
mean
to
find
her
said
sherlock
holmes
going
through
this
house
till
do
find
her
where
is
your
warrant
holmes
half
drew
revolver
from
his
pocket
this
will
have
to
serve
till
better
one
comes
why
you
re
common
burglar
so
you
might
describe
me
said
holmes
cheerfully
my
companion
is
also
dangerous
ruffian
and
together
we
are
going
through
your
house
our
opponent
opened
the
door
fetch
policeman
annie
said
he
there
was
whisk
of
feminine
skirts
down
the
passage
and
the
hall
door
was
opened
and
shut
our
time
is
limited
watson
said
holmes
if
you
try
to
stop
us
peters
you
will
most
certainly
get
hurt
where
is
that
coffin
which
was
brought
into
your
house
what
do
you
want
with
the
coffin
it
is
in
use
there
is
body
in
it
must
see
the
body
never
with
my
consent
then
without
it
with
quick
movement
holmes
pushed
the
fellow
to
one
side
and
passed
into
the
hall
door
half
opened
stood
immediately
before
us
we
entered
it
was
the
diningroom
on
the
table
under
half
lit
chandelier
the
coffin
was
lying
holmes
turned
up
the
gas
and
raised
the
lid
deep
down
in
the
recesses
of
the
coffin
lay
an
emaciated
figure
the
glare
from
the
lights
above
beat
down
upon
an
aged
and
withered
face
by
no
possible
process
of
cruelty
starvation
or
disease
could
this
wornout
wreck
be
the
still
beautiful
lady
frances
holmes
face
showed
his
amazement
and
also
his
relief
thank
god
he
muttered
it
someone
else
ah
you
ve
blundered
badly
for
once
mr
sherlock
holmes
said
peters
who
had
followed
us
into
the
room
who
is
the
dead
woman
well
if
you
really
must
know
she
is
an
old
nurse
of
my
wife
rose
spender
by
name
whom
we
found
in
the
brixton
workhouse
infirmary
we
brought
her
round
here
called
in
dr
horsom
of
13
firbank
villas
mind
you
take
the
address
mr
holmes
and
had
her
carefully
tended
as
christian
folk
should
on
the
third
day
she
died
certificate
says
senile
decay
but
that
only
the
doctor
opinion
and
of
course
you
know
better
we
ordered
her
funeral
to
be
carried
out
by
stimson
and
co
of
the
kennington
road
who
will
bury
her
at
eight
clock
to
morrow
morning
can
you
pick
any
hole
in
that
mr
holmes
you
ve
made
silly
blunder
and
you
may
as
well
own
up
to
it
give
something
for
photograph
of
your
gaping
staring
face
when
you
pulled
aside
that
lid
expecting
to
see
the
lady
frances
carfax
and
only
found
poor
old
woman
of
ninety
holmes
expression
was
as
impassive
as
ever
under
the
jeers
of
his
antagonist
but
his
clenched
hands
betrayed
his
acute
annoyance
am
going
through
your
house
said
he
are
you
though
cried
peters
as
woman
voice
and
heavy
steps
sounded
in
the
passage
we
ll
soon
see
about
that
this
way
officers
if
you
please
these
men
have
forced
their
way
into
my
house
and
cannot
get
rid
of
them
help
me
to
put
them
out
sergeant
and
constable
stood
in
the
doorway
holmes
drew
his
card
from
his
case
this
is
my
name
and
address
this
is
my
friend
dr
watson
bless
you
sir
we
know
you
very
well
said
the
sergeant
but
you
can
stay
here
without
warrant
of
course
not
quite
understand
that
arrest
him
cried
peters
we
know
where
to
lay
our
hands
on
this
gentleman
if
he
is
wanted
said
the
sergeant
majestically
but
you
ll
have
to
go
mr
holmes
yes
watson
we
shall
have
to
go
minute
later
we
were
in
the
street
once
more
holmes
was
as
cool
as
ever
but
was
hot
with
anger
and
humiliation
the
sergeant
had
followed
us
sorry
mr
holmes
but
that
the
law
exactly
sergeant
you
could
not
do
otherwise
expect
there
was
good
reason
for
your
presence
there
if
there
is
anything
can
do—
it
missing
lady
sergeant
and
we
think
she
is
in
that
house
expect
warrant
presently
then
ll
keep
my
eye
on
the
parties
mr
holmes
if
anything
comes
along
will
surely
let
you
know
it
was
only
nine
clock
and
we
were
off
full
cry
upon
the
trail
at
once
first
we
drove
to
brixton
workhoused
infirmary
where
we
found
that
it
was
indeed
the
truth
that
charitable
couple
had
called
some
days
before
that
they
had
claimed
an
imbecile
old
woman
as
former
servant
and
that
they
had
obtained
permission
to
take
her
away
with
them
no
surprise
was
expressed
at
the
news
that
she
had
since
died
the
doctor
was
our
next
goal
he
had
been
called
in
had
found
the
woman
dying
of
pure
senility
had
actually
seen
her
pass
away
and
had
signed
the
certificate
in
due
form
assure
you
that
everything
was
perfectly
normal
and
there
was
no
room
for
foul
play
in
the
matter
said
he
nothing
in
the
house
had
struck
him
as
suspicious
save
that
for
people
of
their
class
it
was
remarkable
that
they
should
have
no
servant
so
far
and
no
further
went
the
doctor
finally
we
found
our
way
to
scotland
yard
there
had
been
difficulties
of
procedure
in
regard
to
the
warrant
some
delay
was
inevitable
the
magistrate
signature
might
not
be
obtained
until
next
morning
if
holmes
would
call
about
nine
he
could
go
down
with
lestrade
and
see
it
acted
upon
so
ended
the
day
save
that
near
midnight
our
friend
the
sergeant
called
to
say
that
he
had
seen
flickering
lights
here
and
there
in
the
windows
of
the
great
dark
house
but
that
no
one
had
left
it
and
none
had
entered
we
could
but
pray
for
patience
and
wait
for
the
morrow
sherlock
holmes
was
too
irritable
for
conversation
and
too
restless
for
sleep
left
him
smoking
hard
with
his
heavy
dark
brows
knotted
together
and
his
long
nervous
fingers
tapping
upon
the
arms
of
his
chair
as
he
turned
over
in
his
mind
every
possible
solution
of
the
mystery
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
night
heard
him
prowling
about
the
house
finally
just
after
had
been
called
in
the
morning
he
rushed
into
my
room
he
was
in
his
dressing
gown
but
his
pale
holloweyed
face
told
me
that
his
night
had
been
sleepless
one
what
time
was
the
funeral
eight
was
it
not
he
asked
eagerly
well
it
is
20
now
good
heavens
watson
what
has
become
of
any
brains
that
god
has
given
me
quick
man
quick
it
life
or
death
hundred
chances
on
death
to
one
on
life
ll
never
forgive
myself
never
if
we
are
too
late
five
minutes
had
not
passed
before
we
were
flying
in
hansom
down
baker
street
but
even
so
it
was
twenty
five
to
eight
as
we
passed
big
ben
and
eight
struck
as
we
tore
down
the
brixton
road
but
others
were
late
as
well
as
we
ten
minutes
after
the
hour
the
hearse
was
still
standing
at
the
door
of
the
house
and
even
as
our
foaming
horse
came
to
halt
the
coffin
supported
by
three
men
appeared
on
the
threshold
holmes
darted
forward
and
barred
their
way
take
it
back
he
cried
laying
his
hand
on
the
breast
of
the
foremost
take
it
back
this
instant
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
once
again
ask
you
where
is
your
warrant
shouted
the
furious
peters
his
big
red
face
glaring
over
the
farther
end
of
the
coffin
the
warrant
is
on
its
way
the
coffin
shall
remain
in
the
house
until
it
comes
the
authority
in
holmes
voice
had
its
effect
upon
the
bearers
peters
had
suddenly
vanished
into
the
house
and
they
obeyed
these
new
orders
quick
watson
quick
here
is
screwdriver
he
shouted
as
the
coffin
was
replaced
upon
the
table
here
one
for
you
my
man
sovreign
if
the
lid
comes
off
in
minute
ask
no
questions
work
away
that
good
another
and
another
now
pull
all
together
it
giving
it
giving
ah
that
does
it
at
last
with
united
effort
we
tore
off
the
coffin
lid
as
we
did
so
there
came
from
the
inside
stupefying
and
overpowering
smell
of
chloroform
body
lay
within
its
head
all
wreathed
in
cottonwool
which
had
been
soaked
in
the
narcotic
holmes
plucked
it
off
and
disclosed
the
statuesque
face
of
handsome
and
spiritual
woman
of
middle
age
in
an
instant
he
had
passed
his
arm
round
the
figure
and
raised
her
to
sitting
position
is
she
gone
watson
is
there
spark
left
surely
we
are
not
too
late
for
half
an
hour
it
seemed
that
we
were
what
with
actual
suffocation
and
what
with
the
poisonous
fumes
of
the
chloroform
the
lady
frances
seemed
to
have
passed
the
last
point
of
recall
and
then
at
last
with
artificial
respiration
with
injected
ether
and
with
every
device
that
science
could
suggest
some
flutter
of
life
some
quiver
of
the
eyelids
some
dimming
of
mirror
spoke
of
the
slowly
returning
life
cab
had
driven
up
and
holmes
parting
the
blind
looked
out
at
it
here
is
lestrade
with
his
warrant
said
he
will
find
that
his
birds
have
flown
and
here
he
added
as
heavy
step
hurried
along
the
passage
is
someone
who
has
better
right
to
nurse
this
lady
than
we
have
good
morning
mr
green
think
that
the
sooner
we
can
move
the
lady
frances
the
better
meanwhile
the
funeral
may
proceed
and
the
poor
old
woman
who
still
lies
in
that
coffin
may
go
to
her
last
resting
place
alone

should
you
care
to
add
the
case
to
your
annals
my
dear
watson
said
holmes
that
evening
it
can
only
be
as
an
example
of
that
temporary
eclipse
to
which
even
the
best
balanced
mind
may
be
exposed
such
slips
are
common
to
all
mortals
and
the
greatest
is
he
who
can
recognize
and
repair
them
to
this
modified
credit
may
perhaps
make
some
claim
my
night
was
haunted
by
the
thought
that
somewhere
clue
strange
sentence
curious
observation
had
come
under
my
notice
and
had
been
too
easily
dismissed
then
suddenly
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
the
words
came
back
to
me
it
was
the
remark
of
the
undertaker
wife
as
reported
by
philip
green
she
had
said
it
should
be
there
before
now
it
took
longer
being
out
of
the
ordinary
it
was
the
coffin
of
which
she
spoke
it
had
been
out
of
the
ordinary
that
could
only
mean
that
it
had
been
made
to
some
special
measurement
but
why
then
in
an
instant
remembered
the
deep
sides
and
the
little
wasted
figure
at
the
bottom
why
so
large
coffin
for
so
small
body
to
leave
room
for
another
body
both
would
be
buried
under
the
one
certificate
it
had
all
been
so
clear
if
only
my
own
sight
had
not
been
dimmed
at
eight
the
lady
frances
would
be
buried
our
one
chance
was
to
stop
the
coffin
before
it
left
the
house
it
was
desperate
chance
that
we
might
find
her
alive
but
it
was
chance
as
the
result
showed
these
people
had
never
to
my
knowledge
done
murder
they
might
shrink
from
actual
violence
at
the
last
the
could
bury
her
with
no
sign
of
how
she
met
her
end
and
even
if
she
were
exhumed
there
was
chance
for
them
hoped
that
such
considerations
might
prevail
with
them
you
can
reconstruct
the
scene
well
enough
you
saw
the
horrible
den
upstairs
where
the
poor
lady
had
been
kept
so
long
they
rushed
in
and
overpowered
her
with
their
chloroform
carried
her
down
poured
more
into
the
coffin
to
insure
against
her
waking
and
then
screwed
down
the
lid
clever
device
watson
it
is
new
to
me
in
the
annals
of
crime
if
our
ex
missionary
friends
escape
the
clutches
of
lestrade
shall
expect
to
hear
of
some
brilliant
incidents
in
their
future
career
mrs
hudson
the
landlady
of
sherlock
holmes
was
longsuffering
woman
not
only
was
her
first
floor
flat
invaded
at
all
hours
by
throngs
of
singular
and
often
undesirable
characters
but
her
remarkable
lodger
showed
an
eccentricity
and
irregularity
in
his
life
which
must
have
sorely
tried
her
patience
his
incredible
untidiness
his
addiction
to
music
at
strange
hours
his
occasional
revolver
practice
within
doors
his
weird
and
often
malodorous
scientific
experiments
and
the
atmosphere
of
violence
and
danger
which
hung
around
him
made
him
the
very
worst
tenant
in
london
on
the
other
hand
his
payments
were
princely
have
no
doubt
that
the
house
might
have
been
purchased
at
the
price
which
holmes
paid
for
his
rooms
during
the
years
that
was
with
him
the
landlady
stood
in
the
deepest
awe
of
him
and
never
dared
to
interfere
with
him
however
outrageous
his
proceedings
might
seem
she
was
fond
of
him
too
for
he
had
remarkable
gentleness
and
courtesy
in
his
dealings
with
women
he
disliked
and
distrusted
the
sex
but
he
was
always
chivalrous
opponent
knowing
how
genuine
was
her
regard
for
him
listened
earnestly
to
her
story
when
she
came
to
my
rooms
in
the
second
year
of
my
married
life
and
told
me
of
the
sad
condition
to
which
my
poor
friend
was
reduced
he
dying
dr
watson
said
she
for
three
days
he
has
been
sinking
and
doubt
if
he
will
last
the
day
he
would
not
let
me
get
doctor
this
morning
when
saw
his
bones
sticking
out
of
his
face
and
his
great
bright
eyes
looking
at
me
could
stand
no
more
of
it
with
your
leave
or
without
it
mr
holmes
am
going
for
doctor
this
very
hour
said
let
it
be
watson
then
said
he
wouldn
waste
an
hour
in
coming
to
him
sir
or
you
may
not
see
him
alive
was
horrified
for
had
heard
nothing
of
his
illness
need
not
say
that
rushed
for
my
coat
and
my
hat
as
we
drove
back
asked
for
the
details
there
is
little
can
tell
you
sir
he
has
been
working
at
case
down
at
rotherhithe
in
an
alley
near
the
river
and
he
has
brought
this
illness
back
with
him
he
took
to
his
bed
on
wednesday
afternoon
and
has
never
moved
since
for
these
three
days
neither
food
nor
drink
has
passed
his
lips
good
god
why
did
you
not
call
in
doctor
he
wouldn
have
it
sir
you
know
how
masterful
he
is
didn
dare
to
disobey
him
but
he
not
long
for
this
world
as
you
ll
see
for
yourself
the
moment
that
you
set
eyes
on
him
he
was
indeed
deplorable
spectacle
in
the
dim
light
of
foggy
november
day
the
sick
room
was
gloomy
spot
but
it
was
that
gaunt
wasted
face
staring
at
me
from
the
bed
which
sent
chill
to
my
heart
his
eyes
had
the
brightness
of
fever
there
was
hectic
flush
upon
either
cheek
and
dark
crusts
clung
to
his
lips
the
thin
hands
upon
the
coverlet
twitched
incessantly
his
voice
was
croaking
and
spasmodic
he
lay
listlessly
as
entered
the
room
but
the
sight
of
me
brought
gleam
of
recognition
to
his
eyes
well
watson
we
seem
to
have
fallen
upon
evil
days
said
he
in
feeble
voice
but
with
something
of
his
old
carelessness
of
manner
my
dear
fellow
cried
approaching
him
stand
back
stand
right
back
said
he
with
the
sharp
imperiousness
which
had
associated
only
with
moments
of
crisis
if
you
approach
me
watson
shall
order
you
out
of
the
house
but
why
because
it
is
my
desire
is
that
not
enough
yes
mrs
hudson
was
right
he
was
more
masterful
than
ever
it
was
pitiful
however
to
see
his
exhaustion
only
wished
to
help
explained
exactly
you
will
help
best
by
doing
what
you
are
told
certainly
holmes
he
relaxed
the
austerity
of
his
manner
you
are
not
angry
he
asked
gasping
for
breath
poor
devil
how
could
be
angry
when
saw
him
lying
in
such
plight
before
me
it
for
your
own
sake
watson
he
croaked
for
my
sake
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
it
is
coolie
disease
from
sumatra
thing
that
the
dutch
know
more
about
than
we
though
they
have
made
little
of
it
up
to
date
one
thing
only
is
certain
it
is
infallibly
deadly
and
it
is
horribly
contagious
he
spoke
now
with
feverish
energy
the
long
hands
twitching
and
jerking
as
he
motioned
me
away
contagious
by
touch
watson
that
it
by
touch
keep
your
distance
and
all
is
well
good
heavens
holmes
do
you
suppose
that
such
consideration
weighs
with
me
of
an
instant
it
would
not
affect
me
in
the
case
of
stranger
do
you
imagine
it
would
prevent
me
from
doing
my
duty
to
so
old
friend
again
advanced
but
he
repulsed
me
with
look
of
furious
anger
if
you
will
stand
there
will
talk
if
you
do
not
you
must
leave
the
room
have
so
deep
respect
for
the
extraordinary
qualities
of
holmes
that
have
always
deferred
to
his
wishes
even
when
least
understood
them
but
now
all
my
professional
instincts
were
aroused
let
him
be
my
master
elsewhere
at
least
was
his
in
sick
room
holmes
said
you
are
not
yourself
sick
man
is
but
child
and
so
will
treat
you
whether
you
like
it
or
not
will
examine
your
symptoms
and
treat
you
for
them
he
looked
at
me
with
venomous
eyes
if
am
to
have
doctor
whether
will
or
not
let
me
at
least
have
someone
in
whom
have
confidence
said
he
then
you
have
none
in
me
in
your
friendship
certainly
but
facts
are
facts
watson
and
after
all
you
are
only
general
practitioner
with
very
limited
experience
and
mediocre
qualifications
it
is
painful
to
have
to
say
these
things
but
you
leave
me
no
choice
was
bitterly
hurt
such
remark
is
unworthy
of
you
holmes
it
shows
me
very
clearly
the
state
of
your
own
nerves
but
if
you
have
no
confidence
in
me
would
not
intrude
my
services
let
me
bring
sir
jasper
meek
or
penrose
fisher
or
any
of
the
best
men
in
london
but
someone
you
must
have
and
that
is
final
if
you
think
that
am
going
to
stand
here
and
see
you
die
without
either
helping
you
myself
or
bringing
anyone
else
to
help
you
then
you
have
mistaken
your
man
you
mean
well
watson
said
the
sick
man
with
something
between
sob
and
groan
shall
demonstrate
your
own
ignorance
what
do
you
know
pray
of
tapanuli
fever
what
do
you
know
of
the
black
formosa
corruption
have
never
heard
of
either
there
are
many
problems
of
disease
many
strange
pathological
possibilities
in
the
east
watson
he
paused
after
each
sentence
to
collect
his
failing
strength
have
learned
so
much
during
some
recent
researches
which
have
medico
criminal

it

in

them

resolutely
to
the

never

had
such
shock
in
an
instant
with
tigerspring
the
dying
man
had
intercepted
me
heard
the
sharp
snap
of
twisted
key
the
next
moment
he
had
staggered
back
to
his
bed
exhausted
and
panting
after
his
one
tremendous
outflame
of
energy
you
won
take
the
key

watson
ve
got
you
my
friend
here
you

and

you
all

gasps
with
terrible
struggles

my

good
at

four
clock
at
six
you
can
go
this
is
insanity
holmes
only
two
hours
watson
promise
you
will
go
at
six
are
you
content
to
wait
seem
to
have
no
choice
none
in
the
world
watson
thank
you
need
no
help
in
arranging
the
clothes
you
will
please
keep
your
distance
now
watson
there
is
one
other
condition
that
would
make
you
will
seek
help
not
from
the
man
you
mention
but
from
the
one
that
choose
by
all
means
the
first
three
sensible
words
that
you
have
uttered
since
you
entered
this
room
watson
you
will
find
some
books
over
there
am
somewhat
exhausted
wonder
how
battery
feels
when
it
pours
electricity
into
non
conductor
at
six
watson
we
resume
our
conversation
but
it
was
destined
to
be
resumed
long
before
that
hour
and
in
circumstances
which
gave
me
shock
hardly
second
to
that
caused
by
his
spring
to
the
door
had
stood
for
some
minutes
looking
at
the
silent
figure
in
the
bed
his
face
was
almost
covered
by
the
clothes
and
he
appeared
to
be
asleep
then
unable
to
settle
down
to
reading
walked
slowly
round
the
room
examining
the
pictures
of
celebrated
criminals
with
which
every
wall
was
adorned
finally
in
my
aimless
perambulation
came
to
the
mantelpiece
litter
of
pipes
tobacco
pouches
syringes
penknives
revolver
cartridges
and
other
debris
was
scattered
over
it
in
the
midst
of
these
was
small
black
and
white
ivory
box
with
sliding
lid
it
was
neat
little
thing
and
had
stretched
out
my
hand
to
examine
it
more
closely
when
it
was
dreadful
cry
that
he
gave
yell
which
might
have
been
heard
down
the
street
my
skin
went
cold
and
my
hair
bristled
at
that
horrible
scream
as
turned
caught
glimpse
of
convulsed
face
and
frantic
eyes
stood
paralyzed
with
the
little
box
in
my
hand
put
it
down
this
instant
watson
this
instant
say
his
head
sank
back
upon
the
pillow
and
he
gave
deep
sigh
of
relief
as
replaced
the
box
upon
the
mantelpiece
hate
to
have
my
things
touched
watson
you
know
that
hate
it
you
fidget
me
beyond
endurance
you
doctor
you
are
enough
to
drive
patient
into
an
asylum
sit
down
man
and
let
me
have
my
rest
the
incident
left
most
unpleasant
impression
upon
my
mind
the
violent
and
causeless
excitement
followed
by
this
brutality
of
speech
so
far
removed
from
his
usual
suavity
showed
me
how
deep
was
the
disorganization
of
his
mind
of
all
ruins
that
of
noble
mind
is
the
most
deplorable
sat
in
silent
dejection
until
the
stipulated
time
had
passed
he
seemed
to
have
been
watching
the
clock
as
well
as
for
it
was
hardly
six
before
he
began
to
talk
with
the
same
feverish
animation
as
before
now
watson
said
he
have
you
any
change
in
your
pocket
yes
any
silver
good
deal
how
many
half
crowns
have
five
ah
too
few
too
few
how
very
unfortunate
watson
however
such
as
they
are
you
can
put
them
in
your
watchpocket
and
all
the
rest
of
your
money
in
your
left
trouser
pocket
thank
you
it
will
balance
you
so
much
better
like
that
this
was
raving
insanity
he
shuddered
and
again
made
sound
between
cough
and
sob
you
will
now
light
the
gas
watson
but
you
will
be
very
careful
that
not
for
one
instant
shall
it
be
more
than
half
on
implore
you
to
be
careful
watson
thank
you
that
is
excellent
no
you
need
not
draw
the
blind
now
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
place
some
letters
and
papers
upon
this
table
within
my
reach
thank
you
now
some
of
that
litter
from
the
mantelpiece
excellent
watson
there
is
sugar
tongs
there
kindly
raise
that
small
ivory
box
with
its
assistance
place
it
here
among
the
papers
good
you
can
now
go
and
fetch
mr
culverton
smith
of
13
lower
burke
street
to
tell
the
truth
my
desire
to
fetch
doctor
had
somewhat
weakened
for
poor
holmes
was
so
obviously
delirious
that
it
seemed
dangerous
to
leave
him
however
he
was
as
eager
now
to
consult
the
person
named
as
he
had
been
obstinate
in
refusing
never
heard
the
name
said
possibly
not
my
good
watson
it
may
surprise
you
to
know
that
the
man
upon
earth
who
is
best
versed
in
this
disease
is
not
medical
man
but
planter
mr
culverton
smith
is
well
known
resident
of
sumatra
now
visiting
london
an
outbreak
of
the
disease
upon
his
plantation
which
was
distant
from
medical
aid
caused
him
to
study
it
himself
with
some
rather
far
reaching
consequences
he
is
very
methodical
person
and
did
not
desire
you
to
start
before
six
because
was
well
aware
that
you
would
not
find
him
in
his
study
if
you
could
persuade
him
to
come
here
and
give
us
the
benefit
of
his
unique
experience
of
this
disease
the
investigation
of
which
has
been
his
dearest
hobby
cannot
doubt
that
he
could
help
me
gave
holmes
remarks
as
consecutive
whole
and
will
not
attempt
to
indicate
how
they
were
interrupted
by
gaspings
for
breath
and
those
clutchings
of
his
hands
which
indicated
the
pain
from
which
he
was
suffering
his
appearance
had
changed
for
the
worse
during
the
few
hours
that
had
been
with
him
those
hectic
spots
were
more
pronounced
the
eyes
shone
more
brightly
out
of
darker
hollows
and
cold
sweat
glimmered
upon
his
brow
he
still
retained
however
the
jaunty
gallantry
of
his
speech
to
the
last
gasp
he
would
always
be
the
master
you
will
tell
him
exactly
how
you
have
left
me
said
he
you
will
convey
the
very
impression
which
is
in
your
own
mind
dying
man
dying
and
delirious
man
indeed
cannot
think
why
the
whole
bed
of
the
ocean
is
not
one
solid
mass
of
oysters
so
prolific
the
creatures
seem
ah
am
wondering
strange
how
the
brain
controls
the
brain
what
was
saying
watson
my
directions
for
mr
culverton
smith
ah
yes
remember
my
life
depends
upon
it
plead
with
him
watson
there
is
no
good
feeling
between
us
his
nephew
watson
had
suspicions
of
foul
play
and
allowed
him
to
see
it
the
boy
died
horribly
he
has
grudge
against
me
you
will
soften
him
watson
beg
him
pray
him
get
him
here
by
any
means
he
can
save
me
only
he
will
bring
him
in
cab
if
have
to
carry
him
down
to
it
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
sort
you
will
persuade
him
to
come
and
then
you
will
return
in
front
of
him
make
any
excuse
so
as
not
to
come
with
him
don
forget
watson
you
won
fail
me
you
never
did
fail
me
no
doubt
there
are
natural
enemies
which
limit
the
increase
of
the
creatures
you
and
watson
we
have
done
our
part
shall
the
world
then
be
overrun
by
oysters
no
horrible
you
ll
convey
all
that
is
in
your
mind
left
him
full
of
the
image
of
this
magnificent
intellect
babbling
like
foolish
child
he
had
handed
me
the
key
and
with
happy
thought
took
it
with
me
lest
he
should
lock
himself
in
mrs
hudson
was
waiting
trembling
and
weeping
in
the
passage
behind
me
as
passed
from
the
flat
heard
holmes
high
thin
voice
in
some
delirious
chant
below
as
stood
whistling
for
cab
man
came
on
me
through
the
fog
how
is
mr
holmes
sir
he
asked
it
was
an
old
acquaintance
inspector
morton
of
scotland
yard
dressed
in
unofficial
tweeds
he
is
very
ill
answered
he
looked
at
me
in
most
singular
fashion
had
it
not
been
too
fiendish
could
have
imagined
that
the
gleam
of
the
fanlight
showed
exultation
in
his
face
heard
some
rumour
of
it
said
he
the
cab
had
driven
up
and
left
him
lower
burke
street
proved
to
be
line
of
fine
houses
lying
in
the
vague
borderland
between
notting
hill
and
kensington
the
particular
one
at
which
my
cabman
pulled
up
had
an
air
of
smug
and
demure
respectability
in
its
old
fashioned
iron
railings
its
massive
folding
door
and
its
shining
brasswork
all
was
in
keeping
with
solemn
butler
who
appeared
framed
in
the
pink
radiance
of
tinted
electrical
light
behind
him
yes
mr
culverton
smith
is
in
dr
watson
very
good
sir
will
take
up
your
card
my
humble
name
and
title
did
not
appear
to
impress
mr
culverton

through
the
half
open

who
is
this
person
what
does
he
want
dear
me
staples
how
often
have
said
that
am
not
to
be
disturbed
in
my
hours
of
study
there
came
gentle
flow
of
soothing
explanation
from
the
butler
well
won
see
him
staples
can
have
my
work
interrupted
like
this
am
not
at
home
say
so
tell
him
to
come
in
the
morning
if
he
really
must
see
me
again
the
gentle
murmur
well
give
him
that
message
he
can
come
in
the
morning
or
he
can
stay
away
my
work
must
not
be
hindered
thought
of
holmes
tossing
upon
his
bed
of
sickness
and
counting
the
minutes
perhaps
until
could
bring
help
to
him
it
was
not
time
to
stand
upon
ceremony
his
life
depended
upon
my
promptness
before
the
apologetic
butler
had
delivered
his
message
had
pushed
past
him
and
was
in
the
room
with
shrill
cry
of
anger
man
rose
from
reclining
chair
beside
the
fire
saw
great
yellow
face
coarse
grained
and
greasy
with
heavy
double
chin
and
two
sullen
menacing
grey
eyes
which
glared
at
me
from
under
tufted
and
sandy
brows
high
bald
head
had
small
velvet
smoking
cap
poised
coquettishly
upon
one
side
of
its
pink
curve
the
skull
was
of
enormous
capacity
and
yet
as
looked
down
saw
to
my
amazement
that
the
figure
of
the
man
was
small
and
frail
twisted
in
the
shoulders
and
back
like
one
who
has
suffered
from
rickets
in
his
childhood
what
this
he
cried
in
high
screaming
voice
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
intrusion
didn
send
you
word
that
would
see
you
to
morrow
morning
am
sorry
said
but
the
matter
cannot
be
delayed
mr
sherlock
holmes—
the
mention
of
my
friend
name
had
an
extraordinary
effect
upon
the
little
man
the
look
of
anger
passed
in
an
instant
from
his
face
his
features
became
tense
and
alert
have
you
come
from
holmes
he
asked
have
just
left
him
what
about
holmes
how
is
he
is
desperately
ill
that
is
why
have
come
the
man
motioned
me
to
chair
and
turned
to
resume
his
own
as
he
did
so
caught
glimpse
of
his
face
in
the
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
could
have
sworn
that
it
was
set
in
malicious
and
abominable
smile
yet
persuaded
myself
that
it
must
have
been
some
nervous
contraction
which
had
surprised
for
he
turned
to
me
an
instant
later
with
genuine
concern
upon
his
features
am
sorry
to
hear
this
said
he
only
know
mr
holmes
through
some
business
dealings
which
we
have
had
but
have
every
respect
for
his
talents
and
his
character
he
is
an
amateur
of
crime
as
am
of
disease
for
him
the
villain
for
me
the
microbe
there
are
my
prisons
he
continued
pointing
to
row
of
bottles
and
jars
which
stood
upon
side
table
among
those
gelatine
cultivations
some
of
the
very
worst
offenders
in
the
world
are
now
doing
time
it
was
on
account
of
your
special
knowledge
that
mr
holmes
desired
to
see
you
he
has
high
opinion
of
you
and
thought
that
you
were
the
one
man
in
london
who
could
help
him
the
little
man
started
and
the
jaunty
smoking
cap
slid
to
the
floor
why
he
asked
why
should
mr
homes
think
that
could
help
him
in
his
trouble
because
of
your
knowledge
of
eastern
diseases
but
why
should
he
think
that
this
disease
which
he
has
contracted
is
eastern
because
in
some
professional
inquiry
he
has
been
working
among
chinese
sailors
down
in
the
docks
mr
culverton
smith
smiled
pleasantly
and
picked
up
his
smokingcap
oh
that
it
is
it
said
he
trust
the
matter
is
not
so
grave
as
you
suppose
how
long
has
he
been
ill
about
three
days
is
he
delirious
occasionally
tut
this
sounds
serious
it
would
be
inhuman
not
to
answer
his
call
very
much
resent
any
interruption
to
my
work
dr
watson
but
this
case
is
certainly
exceptional
will
come
with
you
at
once
remembered
holmes
injunction
have
another
appointment
said
very
good
will
go
alone
have
note
of
mr
holmes
address
you
can
rely
upon
my
being
there
within
half
an
hour
at
most
it
was
with
sinking
heart
that
reentered
holmes
bedroom
for
all
that
knew
the
worst
might
have
happened
in
my
absence
to
my
enormous
relief
he
had
improved
greatly
in
the
interval
his
appearance
was
as
ghastly
as
ever
but
all
trace
of
delirium
had
left
him
and
he
spoke
in
feeble
voice
it
is
true
but
with
even
more
than
his
usual
crispness
and
lucidity
well
did
you
see
him
watson
yes
he
is
coming
admirable
watson
admirable
you
are
the
best
of
messengers
he
wished
to
return
with
me
that
would
never
do
watson
that
would
be
obviously
impossible
did
he
ask
what
ailed
me
told
him
about
the
chinese
in
the
east
end
exactly
well
watson
you
have
done
all
that
good
friend
could
you
can
now
disappear
from
the
scene
must
wait
and
hear
his
opinion
holmes
of
course
you
must
but
have
reasons
to
suppose
that
this
opinion
would
be
very
much
more
frank
and
valuable
if
he
imagines
that
we
are
alone
there
is
just
room
behind
the
head
of
my
bed
watson
my
dear
holmes
fear
there
is
no
alternative
watson
the
room
does
not
lend
itself
to
concealment
which
is
as
well
as
it
is
the
less
likely
to
arouse
suspicion
but
just
there
watson
fancy
that
it
could
be
done
suddenly
he
sat
up
with
rigid
intentness
upon
his
haggard
face
there
are
the
wheels
watson
quick
man
if
you
love
me
and
don
budge
whatever
happens
whatever
happens
do
you
hear
don
speak
don
move
just
listen
with
all
your
ears
then
in
an
instant
his
sudden
access
of
strength
departed
and
his
masterful
purposeful
talk
droned
away
into
the
low
vague
murmurings
of
semi
delirious
man
›From
the
hiding
place
into
which
had
been
so
swiftly
hustled
heard
the
footfalls
upon
the
stair
with
the
opening
and
the
closing
of
the
bedroom
door
then
to
my
surprise
there
came
long
silence
broken
only
by
the
heavy
breathings
and
gaspings
of
the
sick
man
could
imagine
that
our
visitor
was
standing
by
the
bedside
and
looking
down
at
the
sufferer
at
last
that
strange
hush
was
broken
holmes
he
cried
holmes
in
the
insistent
tone
of
one
who
awakens
sleeper
can
you
hear
me
holmes
there
was
rustling
as
if
he
had
shaken
the
sick
man
roughly
by
the
shoulder
is
that
you
mr
smith
holmes
whispered
hardly
dared
hope
that
you
would
come
the
other
laughed
should
imagine
not
he
said
and
yet
you
see
am
here
coals
of
fire
holmes
coals
of
fire
it
is
very
good
of
you
very
noble
of
you
appreciate
your
special
knowledge
our
visitor
sniggered
you
do
you
are
fortunately
the
only
man
in
london
who
does
do
you
know
what
is
the
matter
with
you
the
same
said
holmes
ah
you
recognize
the
symptoms
only
too
well
shouldn
be
surprised
holmes
shouldn
be
surprised
if
it
were
the
same
bad
lookout
for
you
if
it
is
poor
victor
was
dead
man
on
the
fourth
day
strong
hearty
young
fellow
it
was
certainly
as
you
said
very
surprising
that
he
should
have
contracted
and
out
of
the
way
asiatic
disease
in
the
heart
of
london
disease
too
of
which
had
made
such
very
special
study
singular
coincidence
holmes
very
smart
of
you
to
notice
it
but
rather
uncharitable
to
suggest
that
it
was
cause
and
effect
knew
that
you
did
it
oh
you
did
you
well
you
couldn
prove
it
anyhow
but
what
do
you
think
of
yourself
spreading
reports
about
me
like
that
and
then
crawling
to
me
for
help
the
moment
you
are
in
trouble
what
sort
of
game
is
that
eh
heard
the
rasping
laboured
breathing
of
the
sick
man
give
me
the
water
he
gasped
you
re
precious
near
your
end
my
friend
but
don
want
you
to
go
till
have
had
word
with
you
that
why
give
you
water
there
don
slop
it
about
that
right
can
you
understand
what
say
holmes
groaned
do
what
you
can
for
me
let
bygones
be
bygones
he
whispered
ll
put
the
words
out
of
my
head
swear
will
only
cure
me
and
ll
forget
it
forget
what
well
about
victor
savage
death
you
as
good
as
admitted
just
now
that
you
had
done
it
ll
forget
it
you
can
forget
it
or
remember
it
just
as
you
like
don
see
you
in
the
witnessbox
quite
another
shaped
box
my
good
holmes
assure
you
it
matters
nothing
to
me
that
you
should
know
how
my
nephew
died
it
not
him
we
are
talking
about
it
you
yes
the
fellow
who
came
for
me
ve
forgotten
his
name
said
that
you
contracted
it
down
in
the
east
end
among
the
sailors
could
only
account
for
it
so
you
are
proud
of
your
brains
holmes
are
you
not
think
yourself
smart
don
you
came
across
someone
who
was
smarter
this
time
now
cast
your
mind
back
holmes
can
you
think
of
no
other
way
you
could
have
got
this

where
you

you
to
know
before
you
die
give
me
something
to
ease
my
pain
painful
is
it
yes
the
coolies
used
to
do
some
squealing
towards
the
end

you
as
cramp
fancy
yes
it
is
cramp
well
you
can
hear
what
say
anyhow
listen
now
can
you
remember
any
unusual
incident
in
your
life
just
about
the
time
your
symptoms
began
no
nothing
think
again
too
ill
to
think
well
then
ll
help
you
did
anything
come
by
post
by
post
box
by
chance
fainting
gone
listen
holmes
there
was
sound
as
if
he
was
shaking
the
dying
man
and
it
was
all
that
could
do
to
hold
myself
quiet
in
my
hiding
place
you
must
hear
me
you
shall
hear
me
do
you
remember
box
an
ivory
box
it
came
on
wednesday
you
opened
it
do
you
remember
yes
opened
it
there
was
sharp
spring
inside
it
some
joke—
it
was
no
joke
as
you
will
find
to
your
cost
you
fool
you
would
have
it
and
you
have
got
it
who
asked
you
to
cross
my
path
if
you
had
left
me
alone
would
not
have
hurt
you
remember
holmes
gasped
the
spring
it
drew
blood
this
box
this
on
the
table
the
very
one
by
george
and
it
may
as
well
leave
the
room
in
my
pocket
there
goes
your
last
shred
of
evidence
but
you
have
the
truth
now
holmes
and
you
can
die
with
the
knowledge
that
killed
you
knew
too
much
of
the
fate
of
victor
savage
so
have
sent
you
to
share
it
you
are
very
near
your
end
holmes
will
sit
here
and
will
watch
you
die
holmes
voice
had
sunk
to
an
almost
inaudible
whisper
what
is
that
said
smith
turn
up
the
gas
ah
the
shadows
begin
to
fall
do
they
yes
will
turn
it
up
that
may
see
you
the
better
he
crossed
the
room
and
the
light
suddenly
brightened
is
there
any
other
little
service
that
can
do
you
my
friend
match
and
cigarette
nearly
called
out
in
my
joy
and
my
amazement
he
was
speaking
in
his
natural
voice
little
weak
perhaps
but
the
very
voice
knew
there
was
long
pause
and
felt
that
culverton
smith
was
standing
in
silent
amazement
looking
down
at
his
companion
what
the
meaning
of
this
heard
him
say
at
last
in
dry
rasping
tone
the
best
way
of
successfully
acting
part
is
to
be
it
said
holmes
give
you
my
word
that
for
three
days
have
tasted
neither
food
nor
drink
until
you
were
good
enough
to
pour
me
out
that
glass
of
water
but
it
is
the
tobacco
which
find
most
irksome
ah
here
are
some
cigarettes
heard
the
striking
of
match
that
is
very
much
better
halloa
do
hear
the
step
of
friend
there
were
footfalls
outside
the
door
opened
and
inspector
morton
appeared
all
is
in
order
and
this
is
your
man
said
holmes
the
officer
gave
the
usual
cautions
arrest
you
on
the
charge
of
the
murder
of
one
victor
savage
he
concluded
and
you
might
add
of
the
attempted
murder
of
one
sherlock
holmes
remarked
my
friend
with
chuckle
to
save
an
invalid
trouble
inspector
mr
culverton
smith
was
good
enough
to
give
our
signal
by
turning
up
the
gas
by
the
way
the
prisoner
has
small
box
in
the
right
hand
pocket
of
his
coat
which
it
would
be
as
well
to
remove
thank
you
would
handle
it
gingerly
if
were
you
put
it
down
here
it
may
play
its
part
in
the
trial
there
was
sudden
rush
and
scuffle
followed
by
the
clash
of
iron
and
cry
of
pain
you
ll
only
get
yourself
hurt
said
the
inspector
stand
still
will
you
there
was
the
click
of
the
closing
handcuffs
nice
trap
cried
the
high
snarling
voice
it
will
bring
you
into
the
dock
holmes
not
me
he
asked
me
to
come
here
to
cure
him
was
sorry
for
him
and
came
now
he
will
pretend
no
doubt
that
have
said
anything
which
he
may
invent
which
will
corroborate
his
insane
suspicions
you
can
lie
as
you
like
holmes
my
word
is
always
as
good
as
yours
good
heavens
cried
holmes
had
totally
forgotten
him
my
dear
watson
owe
you
thousand
apologies
to
think
that
should
have
overlooked
you
need
not
introduce
you
to
mr
culverton
smith
since
understand
that
you
met
somewhat
earlier
in
the
evening
have
you
the
cab
below
will
follow
you
when
am
dressed
for
may
be
of
some
use
at
the
station
never
needed
it
more
said
holmes
as
he
refreshed
himself
with
glass
of
claret
and
some
biscuits
in
the
intervals
of
his
toilet
however
as
you
know
my
habits
are
irregular
and
such
feat
means
less
to
me
than
to
most
men
it
was
very
essential
that
should
impress
mrs
hudson
with
the
reality
of
my
condition
since
she
was
to
convey
it
to
you
and
you
in
turn
to
him
you
won
be
offended
watson
you
will
realize
that
among
your
many
talents
dissimulation
finds
no
place
and
that
if
you
had
shared
my
secret
you
would
never
have
been
able
to
impress
smith
with
the
urgent
necessity
of
his
presence
which
was
the
vital
point
of
the
whole
scheme
knowing
his
vindictive
nature
was
perfectly
certain
that
he
would
come
to
look
upon
his
handiwork
but
your
appearance
holmes
your
ghastly
face
three
days
of
absolute
fast
does
not
improve
one
beauty
watson
for
the
rest
there
is
nothing
which
sponge
may
not
cure
with
vaseline
upon
one
forehead
belladonna
in
one
eyes
rouge
over
the
cheek
bones
and
crusts
of
beeswax
round
one
lips
very
satisfying
effect
can
be
produced
malingering
is
subject
upon
which
have
sometimes
thought
of
writing
monograph
little
occasional
talk
about
half
crowns
oysters
or
any
other
extraneous
subject
produces
pleasing
effect
of
delirium
but
why
would
you
not
let
me
near
you
since
there
was
in
truth
no
infection
can
you
ask
my
dear
watson
do
you
imagine
that
have
no
respect
for
your
medical
talents
could
fancy
that
your
astute
judgment
would
pass
dying
man
who
however
weak
had
no
rise
of
pulse
or
temperature
at
four
yards
could
deceive
you
if
failed
to
do
so
who
would
bring
my
smith
within
my
grasp
no
watson
would
not
touch
that
box
you
can
just
see
if
you
look
at
it
sideways
where
the
sharp
spring
like
viper
tooth
emerges
as
you
open
it
dare
say
it
was
by
some
such
device
that
poor
savage
who
stood
between
this
monster
and
reversion
was
done
to
death
my
correspondence
however
is
as
you
know
varied
one
and
am
somewhat
upon
my
guard
against
any
packages
which
reach
me
it
was
clear
to
me
however
that
by
pretending
that
he
had
really
succeeded
in
his
design
might
surprise
confession
that
pretence
have
carried
out
with
the
thoroughness
of
the
true
artist
thank
you
watson
you
must
help
me
on
with
my
coat
when
we
have
finished
at
the
policestation
think
that
something
nutritious
at
simpson
would
not
be
out
of
place
viii
his
last
bow
an
epilogue
of
sherlock
holmes
it
was
nine
clock
at
night
upon
the
second
of
august
the
most
terrible
august
in
the
history
of
the
world
one
might
have
thought
already
that
god
curse
hung
heavy
over
degenerate
world
for
there
was
an
awesome
hush
and
feeling
of
vague
expectancy
in
the
sultry
and
stagnant
air
the
sun
had
long
set
but
one
blood
red
gash
like
an
open
wound
lay
low
in
the
distant
west
above
the
stars
were
shining
brightly
and
below
the
lights
of
the
shipping
glimmered
in
the
bay
the
two
famous
germans
stood
beside
the
stone
parapet
of
the
garden
walk
with
the
long
low
heavily
gabled
house
behind
them
and
they
looked
down
upon
the
broad
sweep
of
the
beach
at
the
foot
of
the
great
chalk
cliff
in
which
von
bork
like
some
wandering
eagle
had
perched
himself
four
years
before
they
stood
with
their
heads
close
together
talking
in
low
confidential
tones
from
below
the
two
glowing
ends
of
their
cigars
might
have
been
the
smouldering
eyes
of
some
malignant
fiend
looking
down
in
the
darkness
remarkable
man
this
von
bork
man
who
could
hardly
be
matched
among
all
the
devoted
agents
of
the
kaiser
it
was
his
talents
which
had
first
recommended
him
for
the
english
mission
the
most
important
mission
of
all
but
since
he
had
taken
it
over
those
talents
had
become
more
and
more
manifest
to
the
half
dozen
people
in
the
world
who
were
really
in
touch
with
the
truth
one
of
these
was
his
present
companion
baron
von
herling
the
chief
secretary
of
the
legation
whose
huge
100
horse
power
benz
car
was
blocking
the
country
lane
as
it
waited
to
waft
its
owner
back
to
london
so
far
as
can
judge
the
trend
of
events
you
will
probably
be
back
in
berlin
within
the
week
the
secretary
was
saying
when
you
get
there
my
dear
von
bork
think
you
will
be
surprised
at
the
welcome
you
will
receive
happen
to
know
what
is
thought
in
the
highest
quarters
of
your
work
in
this
country
he
was
huge
man
the
secretary
deep
broad
and
tall
with
slow
heavy
fashion
of
speech
which
had
been
his
main
asset
in
his
political
career

laughed
they
are
not
very
hard
to
deceive
he
remarked
more
docile
simple
folk
could
not
be
imagined
don
know
about
that
said
the
other
thoughtfully
they
have
strange
limits
and
one
must
learn
to
observe
them
it
is
that
surface
simplicity
of
theirs
which
makes
trap
for
the
stranger
one
first
impression
is
that
they
are
entirely
soft
then
one
comes
suddenly
upon
something
very
hard
and
you
know
that
you
have
reached
the
limit
and
must
adapt
yourself
to
the
fact
they
have
for
example
their
insular
conventions
which
simply
must
be
observed
meaning
good
form
and
that
sort
of
thing
von
bork
sighed
as
one
who
had
suffered
much
meaning
british
prejudice
in
all
its
queer
manifestations
as
an
example
may
quote
one
of
my
own
worst
blunders
can
afford
to
talk
of
my
blunders
for
you
know
my
work
well
enough
to
be
aware
of
my
successes
it
was
on
my
first
arrival
was
invited
to
week
end
gathering
at
the
country
house
of
cabinet
minister
the
conversation
was
amazingly
indiscreet
von
bork
nodded
ve
been
there
said
he
dryly
exactly
well
naturally
sent
resume
of
the
information
to
berlin
unfortunately
our
good
chancellor
is
little
heavyhanded
in
these
matters
and
he
transmitted
remark
which
showed
that
he
was
aware
of
what
had
been
said
this
of
course
took
the
trail
straight
up
to
me
you
ve
no
idea
the
harm
that
it
did
me
there
was
nothing
soft
about
our
british
hosts
on
that
occasion
can
assure
you
was
two
years
living
it
down
now
you
with
this
sporting
pose
of
yours—
no
don
call
it
pose
is
an
artificial
thing
this
is
quite
natural
am
born
sportsman
enjoy
it
well
that
makes
it
the
more
effective
you
yacht
against
them
you
hunt
with
them
you
play
polo
you
match
them
in
every
game
your
four
in

the
prize
at
olympia
have
even
heard
that
you
go
the
length
of
boxing
with
the
young
officers
what
is
the
result
nobody
takes
you
seriously
you
are

time
this

my

von

you
flatter
me

but
certainly
may
claim
my
four
years
in
this
country
have
not
been

ve
never

would
you

in
for
moment
the
door
of
the
study
opened
straight
on
to
the
terrace
von
bork
pushed
it
back
and
leading
the
way
he
clicked
the
switch
of
the
electric
light
he
then
closed
the
door
behind
the
bulky
form
which
followed
him
and
carefully
adjusted
the
heavy
curtain
over
the
latticed
window
only
when
all
these
precautions
had
been
taken
and
tested
did
he
turn
his
sunburned
aquiline
face
to
his
guest
some
of
my
papers
have
gone
said
he
when
my
wife
and
the
household
left
yesterday
for
flushing
they
took
the
less
important
with
them
must
of
course
claim
the
protection
of
the
embassy
for
the
others
your
name
has
already
been
files
as
one
of
the
personal
suite
there
will
be
no
difficulties
for
you
or
your
baggage
of
course
it
is
just
possible
that
we
may
not
have
to
go
england
may
leave
france
to
her
fate
we
are
sure
that
there
is
no
binding
treaty
between
them
and
belgium
yes
and
belgium
too
von
bork
shook
his
head
don
see
how
that
could
be
there
is
definite
treaty
there
she
could
never
recover
from
such
humiliation
she
would
at
least
have
peace
for
the
moment
but
her
honour
tut
my
dear
sir
we
live
in
utilitarian
age
honour
is
mediaeval
conception
besides
england
is
not
ready
it
is
an
inconceivable
thing
but
even
our
special
war
tax
of
fifty
million
which
one
would
think
made
our
purpose
as
clear
as
if
we
had
advertised
it
on
the
front
page
of
the
times
has
not
roused
these
people
from
their
slumbers
here
and
there
one
hears
question
it
is
my
business
to
find
an
answer
here
and
there
also
there
is
an
irritation
it
is
my
business
to
soothe
it
but
can
assure
you
that
so
far
as
the
essentials
go
the
storage
of
munitions
the
preparation
for
submarine
attack
the
arrangements
for
making
high
explosives
nothing
is
prepared
how
then
can
england
come
in
especially
when
we
have
stirred
he
up
such
devil
brew
of
irish
civil
war
window
breaking
furies
and
god
knows
what
to
keep
her
thoughts
at
home
she
must
think
of
her
future
ah
that
is
another
matter
fancy
that
in
the
future
we
have
our
own
very
definite
plans
about
england
and
that
your
information
will
be
very
vital
to
us
it
is
to
day
or
to
morrow
with
mr
john
bull
if
he
prefers
to
day
we
are
perfectly
ready
if
it
is
to
morrow
we
shall
be
more
ready
still
should
think
they
would
be
wiser
to
fight
with
allies
than
without
them
but
that
is
their
own
affair
this
week
is
their
week
of
destiny
but
you
were
speaking
of
your
papers
he
sat
in
the
armchair
with
the
light
shining
upon
his
broad
bald
head
while
he
puffed
sedately
at
his
cigar
the
large
oak
panelled
book
lined
room
had
curtain
hung
in
the
future
corner
when
this
was
drawn
it
disclosed
large
brassbound
safe
von
bork
detached
small
key
from
his
watch
chain
and
after
some
considerable
manipulation
of
the
lock
he
swung
open
the
heavy
door
look
said
he
standing
clear
with
wave
of
his
hand
the
light
shone
vividly
into
the
opened
safe
and
the
secretary
of
the
embassy
gazed
with
an
absorbed
interest
at
the
rows
of
stuffed
pigeon
holes
with
which
it
was
furnished
each
pigeonhole
had
its
label
and
his
eyes
as
he
glanced
along
them
read
long
series
of
such
titles
as
fords
harbour
defences
aeroplanes
ireland
egypt
portsmouth
forts
the
channel
rosythe
and
score
of
others
each
compartment
was
bristling
with
papers
and
plans
colossal
said
the
secretary
putting
down
his
cigar
he
softly
clapped
his
fat
hands
and
all
in
four
years
baron
not
such
bad
show
for
the
harddrinking
hard
riding
country
squire
but
the
gem
of
my
collection
is
coming
and
there
is
the
setting
all
ready
for
it
he
pointed
to
space
over
which
naval
signals
was
printed
but
you
have
good
dossier
there
already
out
of
date
and
waste
paper
the
admiralty
in
some
way
got
the
alarm
and
every
code
has
been
changed
it
was
blow
baron
the
worst
setback
in
my
whole
campaign
but
thanks
to
my
check
book
and
the
good
altamont
all
will
be
well
to
night
the
baron
looked
at
his
watch
and
gave
guttural
exclamation
of
disappointment
well
really
can
wait
no
longer
you
can
imagine
that
things
are
moving
at
present
in
carlton
terrace
and
that
we
have
all
to
be
at
our
posts
had
hoped
to
be
able
to
bring
news
of
your
great
coup
did
altamont
name
no
hour
von
bork
pushed
over
telegram
will
come
without
fail
to
night
and
bring
new
sparking
plugs
altamont
sparking
plugs
eh
you
see
he
poses
as
motor
expert
and
keep
full
garage
in
our
code
everything
likely
to
come
up
is
named
after
some
spare
part
if
he
talks
of
radiator
it
is
battleship
of
an
oil
pump
cruiser
and
so
on
sparking
plugs
are
naval
signals
from
portsmouth
at
midday
said
the
secretary
examining
the
superscription
by
the
way
what
do
you
give
him
five
hundred
pounds
for
this
particular
job
of
course
he
has
salary
as
well
the
greedy
rouge
they
are
useful
these
traitors
but
grudge
them
their
blood
money
grudge
altamont
nothing
he
is
wonderful
worker
if
pay
him
well
at
least
he
delivers
the
goods
to
use
his
own
phrase
besides
he
is
not
traitor
assure
you
that
our
most
panGermanic
junker
is
sucking
dove
in
his
feelings
towards
england
as
compared
with
real
bitter
irish
american
oh
an
irish
american
if
you
heard
him
talk
you
would
not
doubt
it
sometimes
assure
you
can
hardly
understand
him
he
seems
to
have
declared
war
on
the
king
english
as
well
as
on
the
english
king
must
you
really
go
he
may
be
here
any
moment
no
sorry
but
have
already
overstayed
my
time
we
shall
expect
you
early
to
morrow
and
when
you
get
that
signal
book
through
the
little
door
on
the
duke
of
york
steps
you
can
put
triumphant
finis
to
your
record
in
england
what
tokay
he
indicated
heavily
sealed
dust
covered
bottle
which
stood
with
two
high
glasses
upon
salver
may
offer
you
glass
before
your
journey
no
thanks
but
it
looks
like
revelry
altamont
has
nice
taste
in
wines
and
he
took
fancy
to
my
tokay
he
is
touchy
fellow
and
needs
humouring
in
small
things
have
to
study
him
assure
you
they
had
strolled
out
on
to
the
terrace
again
and
along
it
to
the
further
end
where
at
touch
from
the
baron
chauffeur
the
great
car
shivered
and
chuckled
those
are
the
lights
of
harwich
suppose
said
the
secretary
pulling
on
his
dust
coat
how
still
and
peaceful
it
all
seems
there
may
be
other
lights
within
the
week
and
the
english
coast
less
tranquil
place
the
heavens
too
may
not
be
quite
so
peaceful
if
all
that
the
good
zepplin
promises
us
comes
true
by
the
way

only
one
window
showed
light
behind
them
in
it
there
stood
lamp
and
beside
it
seated
at
table
was
dear
old
ruddyfaced
woman
in
country
cap
she
was
bending
over
her
knitting
and
stopping
occasionally
to
stroke
large
black
cat
upon
stool
beside
her
that
is
martha
the
only
servant
have
left
the
secretary
chuckled
she
might
almost
personify
britannia
said
he
with
her
complete
self
absorption
and
general
air
of
comfortable
somnolence
well
au
revoir
von
bork
with
final
wave
of
his
hand
he
sprang
into
the
car
and
moment
later
the
two
golden
cones
from
the
headlights
shot
through
the
darkness
the
secretary
lay
back
in
the
cushions
of
the
luxurious
limousine
with
his
thoughts
so
full
of
the
impending
european
tragedy
that
he
hardly
observed
that
as
his
car
swung
round
the
village
street
it
nearly
passed
over
little
ford
coming
in
the
opposite
direction
von
bork
walked
slowly
back
to
the
study
when
the
last
gleams
of
the
motor
lamps
had
faded
into
the
distance
as
he
passed
he
observed
that
his
old
housekeeper
had
put
out
her
lamp
and
retired
it
was
new
experience
to
him
the
silence
and
darkness
of
his
widespread
house
for
his
family
and
household
had
been
large
one
it
was
relief
to
him
however
to
think
that
they
were
all
in
safety
and
that
but
for
that
one
old
woman
who
had
lingered
in
the
kitchen
he
had
the
whole
place
to
himself
there
was
good
deal
of
tidying
up
to
do
inside
his
study
and
he
set
himself
to
do
it
until
his
keen
handsome
face
was
flushed
with
the
heat
of
the
burning
papers
leather
valise
stood
beside
his
table
and
into
this
he
began
to
pack
very
neatly
and
systematically
the
precious
contents
of
his
safe
he
had
hardly
got
started
with
the
work
however
when
his
quick
ears
caught
the
sounds
of
distant
car
instantly
he
gave
an
exclamation
of
satisfaction
strapped
up
the
valise
shut
the
safe
locked
it
and
hurried
out
on
to
the
terrace
he
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
lights
of
small
car
come
to
halt
at
the
gate
passenger
sprang
out
of
it
and
advanced
swiftly
towards
him
while
the
chauffeur
heavily
built
elderly
man
with
grey
moustache
settled
down
like
one
who
resigns
himself
to
long
vigil
well
asked
von
bork
eagerly
running
forward
to
meet
his
visitor
for
answer
the
man
waved
small
brown
paper
parcel
triumphantly
above
his
head
you
can
give
me
the
glad
hand
to
night
mister
he
cried
bringing
home
the
bacon
at
last
the
signals
same
as
said
in
my
cable
every
last
one
of
them
semaphore
lamp
code
marconi
copy
mind
you
not
the
original
that
was
too
dangerous
but
it
the
real
goods
and
you
can
lay
to
that
he
slapped
the
german
upon
the
shoulder
with
rough
familiarity
from
which
the
other
winced
come
in
he
said
all
alone
in
the
house
was
only
waiting
for
this
of
course
copy
is
better
than
the
original
if
an
original
were
missing
they
would
change
the
whole
thing
you
think
it
all
safe
about
the
copy
the
irish
american
had
entered
the
study
and
stretched
his
long
limbs
from
the
armchair
he
was
tall
gaunt
man
of
sixty
with
clear
cut
features
and
small
goatee
beard
which
gave
him
general
resemblance
to
the
caricatures
of
uncle
sam
halfsmoked
sodden
cigar
hung
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
as
he
sat
down
he
struck
match
and
relit
it
making
ready
for
move
he
remarked
as
he
looked
round
him
say
mister
he
added
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
safe
from
which
the
curtain
was
now
removed
you
don
tell
me
you
keep
your
papers
in
that
why
not
gosh
in
wide
open
contraption
like
that
and
they
reckon
you
to
be
some
spy
why
yankee
crook
would
be
into
that
with
can
opener
if
known
that
any
letter
of
mine
was
goin
to
lie
loose
in
thing
like
that
have
been
mug
to
write
to
you
at
all
it
would
puzzle
any
crook
to
force
that
safe
von
bork
answered
you
won
cut
that
metal
with
any
tool
but
the
lock
no
it
double
combination
lock
you
know
what
that
is
search
me
said
the
american
well
you
need
word
as
well
as
set
of
figures
before
you
can
get
the
lock
to
work
he
rose
and
showed
double
radiating
disc
round
the
keyhole
this
outer
one
is
for
the
letters
the
inner
one
for
the
figures
well
that
fine
so
it
nit
quite
as
simple
as
you
thought
it
was
four
years
ago
that
had
it
made
and
what
do
you
think
chose
for
the
word
and
figures
it
beyond
me
well
chose
august
for
the
word
and
1914
for
the
figures
and
here
we
are
the
american
face
showed
his
surprise
and
admiration
my
but
that
was
smart
you
had
it
down
to
fine
thing
yes
few
of
us
even
then
could
have
guessed
the
date
here
it
is
and
shutting
down
to
morrow
morning
well
guess
you
ll
have
to
fix
me
up
also
not
staying
is
this
gol
darned
country
all
on
my
lonesome
in
week
or
less
from
what
see
john
bull
will
be
on
his
hind
legs
and
fair
ramping
rather
watch
him
from
over
the
water
but
you
re
an
american
citizen
well
so
was
jack
james
an
american
citizen
but
he
doing
time
in
portland
all
the
same
it
cuts
no
ice
with
british
copper
to
tell
him
you
re
an
american
citizen
it
british
law
and
order
over
here
says
he
by
the
way
mister
talking
of
jack
james
it
seems
to
me
you
don
do
much
to
cover
your
men
what
do
you
mean
von
bork
asked
sharply
well
you
are
their
employer
ain
you
it
up
to
you
to
see
that
they
don
fall
down
but
they
do
fall
down
and
when
did
you
ever
pick
them
up
there
james—
it
was
james
own
fault
you
know
that
yourself
he
was
too
self
willed
for
the
job
james
was
bonehead
give
you
that
then
there
was
hollis
the
man
was
mad
well
he
went
bit
woozy
towards
the
end
it
enough
to
make
man
bug
house
when
he
has
to
play
part
from
morning
to
night
with
hundred
guys
all
ready
to
set
the
coppers
wise
to
him
but
now
there
is
steiner—
von
bork
started
violently
and
his
ruddy
face
turned
shade
paler
what
about
steiner
well
they
ve
got
him
that
all
they
raided
his
store
last
night
and
he
and
his
papers
are
all
in
portsmouth
jail
you
ll
go
off
and
he
poor
devil
will
have
to
stand
the
racket
and
lucky
if
he
gets
off
with
his
life
that
why
want
to
get
over
the
water
as
soon
as
you
do
von
bork
was
strong
self
contained
man
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
news
had
shaken
him
how
could
they
have
got
on
to
steiner
he
muttered
that
the
worst
blow
yet
well
you
nearly
had
worse
one
for
believe
they
are
not
far
off
me
you
don
mean
that
sure
thing
my
landlady
down
fratton
way
had
some
inquiries
and
when
heard
of
it
guessed
it
was
time
for
me
to
hustle
but
what
want
to
know
mister
is
how
the
coppers
know
these
things
steiner
is
the
fifth
man
you
ve
lost
since
signed
on
with
you
and
know
the
name
of
the
sixth
if
don
get
move
on
how
do
you
explain
it
and
ain
you
ashamed
to
see
your
men
go
down
like
this
von
bork
flushed
crimson
how
dare
you
speak
in
such
way
if
didn
dare
things
mister
wouldn
be
in
your
service
but
ll
tell
you
straight
what
is
in
my
mind
ve
heard
that
with
you
german
politicians
when
an
agent
has
done
his
work
you
are
not
sorry
to
see
him
put
away
von
bork
sprang
to
his
feet
do
you
dare
to
suggest
that
have
given
away
my
own
agents
don
stand
for
that
mister
but
there
stool
pigeon
or
cross
somewhere
and
it
up
to
you
to
find
out
where
it
is
anyhow
am
taking
no
more
chances
it
me
for
little
holland
and
the
sooner
the
better
von
bork
had
mastered
his
anger
we
have
been
allies
too
long
to
quarrel
now
at
the
very
hour
of
victory
he
said
you
ve
done
splendid
work
and
taken
risks
and
can
forget
it
by
all
means
go
to
holland
and
you
can
get
boat
from
rotterdam
to
new
york
no
other
line
will
be
safe
week
from
now
ll
take
that
book
and
pack
it
with
the
rest
the
american
held
the
small
parcel
in
his
hand
but
made
no
motion
to
give
it
up
what
about
the
dough
he
asked
the
what
the
boodle
the
reward
the
500
pounds
the
gunner
turned
damned
nasty
at
the
last
and
had
to
square
him
with
an
extra
hundred
dollars

it
would
have
been
nitsky
for
you
and
me

he
and
he
meant
it
too
but
the
last
hundred
did
it
cost
me
two
hundred
pound
from
first
to
last
so
it
isn
likely
give
it
up
without
gettin

von

smiled
with
some
bitterness
you
don
seem
to
have
very
high
opinion
of
my
honour
said

you
want
the
money
before
you
give
up
the
book
well
mister
it
is
business
proposition
all
right
have
your
way
he
sat
down
at
the
table
and
scribbled
check
which
he
tore
from
the
book
but
he
refrained
from
handing
it
to
his
companion
after
all
since
we
are
to
be
on
such
terms
mr
altamont
said
he
don
see
why
should
trust
you
any

the

passed
it
over
without
word
von
bork
undid
winding
of
string
and
two
wrappers
of
paper
then
he
sat
dazing
for
moment
in
silent
amazement
at
small
blue
book
which
lay
before
him
across
the
cover
was
printed
in
golden
letters
practical
handbook
of
bee
culture
only
for
one
instant
did
the
master
spy
glare
at
this
strangely
irrelevant
inscription
the
next
he
was
gripped
at
the
back
of
his
neck
by
grasp
of
iron
and
chloroformed
sponge
was
held
in
front
of
his
writhing
face
another

said
mr
sherlock
holmes
as
he
extended
the
bottle
of
imperial
tokay
the
thickset
chauffeur
who
had
seated
himself
by
the
table
pushed
forward
his
glass
with
some
eagerness
it
is
good
wine
holmes
remarkable
wine
watson
our
friend
upon
the
sofa
has
assured
me
that
it
is
from
franz
josef
special
cellar
at
the
schoenbrunn
palace
might
trouble
you
to
open
the
window
for
chloroform
vapour
does
not
help
the
palate
the
safe
was
ajar
and
holmes
standing
in
front
of
it
was
removing
dossier
after
dossier
swiftly
examining
each
and
then
packing
it
neatly
in
von
bork
valise
the
german
lay
upon
the
sofa
sleeping
stertorously
with
strap
round
his
upper
arms
and
another
round
his
legs
we
need
not
hurry
ourselves
watson
we
are
safe
from
interruption
would
you
mind
touching
the
bell
there
is
no
one
in
the
house
except
old
martha
who
has
played
her
part
to
admiration
got
her
the
situation
here
when
first
took
the
matter
up
ah
martha
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
all
is
well
the
pleasant
old
lady
had
appeared
in
the
doorway
she
curtseyed
with
smile
to
mr
holmes
but
glanced
with
some
apprehension
at
the
figure
upon
the
sofa
it
is
all
right
martha
he
has
not
been
hurt
at
all
am
glad
of
that
mr
holmes
according
to
his
lights
he
has
been
kind
master
he
wanted
me
to
go
with
his
wife
to
germany
yesterday
but
that
would
hardly
have
suited
your
plans
would
it
sir
no
indeed
martha
so
long
as
you
were
here
was
easy
in
my
mind
we
waited
some
time
for
your
signal
to
night
it
was
the
secretary
sir
know
his
car
passed
ours
thought
he
would
never
go
knew
that
it
would
not
suit
your
plans
sir
to
find
him
here
no
indeed
well
it
only
meant
that
we
waited
half
an
hour
or
so
until
saw
your
lamp
go
out
and
knew
that
the
coast
was
clear
you
can
report
to
me
to
morrow
in
london
martha
at
claridge
hotel
very
good
sir
suppose
you
have
everything
ready
to
leave
yes
sir
he
posted
seven
letters
to
day
have
the
addresses
as
usual
very
good
martha
will
look
into
them
to
morrow
goodnight
these
papers
he
continued
as
the
old
lady
vanished
are
not
of
very
great
importance
for
of
course
the
information
which
they
represent
has
been
sent
off
long
ago
to
the
german
government
these
are
the
originals
which
cold
not
safely
be
got
out
of
the
country
then
they
are
of
no
use
should
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
watson
they
will
at
least
show
our
people
what
is
known
and
what
is
not
may
say
that
good
many
of
these
papers
have
come
through
me
and
need
not
add
are
thoroughly
untrustworthy
it
would
brighten
my
declining
years
to
see
german
cruiser
navigating
the
solent
according
to
the
mine
field
plans
which
have
furnished
but
you
watson
he
stopped
his
work
and
took
his
old
friend
by
the
shoulders—
ve
hardly
seen
you
in
the
light
yet
how
have
the
years
used
you
look
the
same
blithe
boy
as
ever
feel
twenty
years
younger
holmes
have
seldom
felt
so
happy
as
when
got
your
wire
asking
me
to
meet
you
at
harwich
with
the
car
but
you
holmes
you
have
changed
very
little—
save
for
that
horrible
goatee
these
are
the
sacrifices
one
makes
for
one
country
watson
said
holmes
pulling
at
his
little
tuft
to
morrow
it
will
be
but
dreadful
memory
with
my
hair
cut
and
few
other
superficial
changes
shall
no
doubt
reappear
at
claridge
tomorrow
as
was
before
this
american
stunt
beg
your
pardon
watson
my
well
of
english
seems
to
be
permanently
defiled—
before
this
american
job
came
my
way
but
you
have
retired
holmes
we
heard
of
you
as
living
the
life
of
hermit
among
your
bees
and
your
books
in
small
farm
upon
the
south
downs
exactly
watson
here
is
the
fruit
of
my
leisured
ease
the
magnum
opus
of
my
latter
years
he
picked
up
the
volume
from
the
table
and
read
out
the
whole
title
practical
handbook
of
bee
culture
with
some
observations
upon
the
segregation
of
the
queen
alone
did
it
behold
the
fruit
of
pensive
nights
and
laborious
days
when
watched
the
little
working
gangs
as
once
watched
the
criminal
world
of
london
but
how
did
you
get
to
work
again
ah
have
often
marvelled
at
it
myself
the
foreign
minister
alone
could
have
withstood
but
when
the
premier
also
deigned
to
visit
my
humble
roof—
the
fact
is
watson
that
this
gentleman
upon
the
sofa
was
bit
too
good
for
our
people
he
was
in
class
by
himself
things
were
going
wrong
and
no
one
could
understand
why
they
were
going
wrong
agents
were
suspected
or
even
caught
but
there
was
evidence
of
some
strong
and
secret
central
force
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
expose
it
strong
pressure
was
brought
upon
me
to
look
into
the
matter
it
has
cost
me
two
years
watson
but
they
have
not
been
devoid
of
excitement
when
say
that
started
my
pilgrimage
at
chicago
graduated
in
an
irish
secret
society
at
buffalo
gave
serious
trouble
to
the
constabulary
at
skibbareen
and
so
eventually
caught
the
eye
of
subordinate
agent
of
von
bork
who
recommended
me
as
likely
man
you
will
realize
that
the
matter
was
complex
since
then
have
been
honoured
by
his
confidence
which
has
not
prevented
most
of
his
plans
going
subtly
wrong
and
five
of
his
best
agents
being
in
prison
watched
them
watson
and
picked
them
as
they
ripened
well
sir
hope
that
you
are
none
the
worse
the
last
remark
was
addressed
to
von
bork
himself
who
after
much
gasping
and
blinking
had
lain
quietly
listening
to
holmes
statement
he
broke
out
now
into
furious
stream
of
german
invective
his
face
convulsed
with
passion
holmes
continued
his
swift
investigation
of
documents
while
his
prisoner
cursed
and
swore
though
unmusical
german
is
the
most
expressive
of
all
languages
he
observed
when
von
bork
had
stopped
from
pure
exhaustion
hullo
he
added
as
he
looked
hard
at
the
corner
of
tracing
before
putting
it
in
the
box
this
should
put
another
bird
in
the
cage
had
no
idea
that
the
paymaster
was
such
rascal
though
have
long
had
an
eye
upon
him
mister
von
bork
you
have
great
deal
to
answer
for
the
prisoner
had
raised
himself
with
some
difficulty
upon
the
sofa
and
was
staring
with
strange
mixture
of
amazement
and
hatred
at
his
captor
shall
get
level
with
you
altamont
he
said
speaking
with
slow
deliberation
if
it
takes
me
all
my
life
shall
get
level
with
you
the
old
sweet
song
said
holmes
how
often
have
heard
it
in
days
gone
by
it
was
favorite
ditty
of
the
late
lamented
professor
moriarty
colonel
sebastian
moran
has
also
been
known
to
warble
it
and
yet
live
and
keep
bees
upon
the
south
downs
curse
you
double
traitor
cried
the
german
straining
against
his
bonds
and
glaring
murder
from
his
furious
eyes
no
it
is
not
so
bad
as
that
said
holmes
smiling
as
my
speech
surely
shows
you
mr
altamont
of
chicago
had
no
existence
in
fact
used
him
and
he
is
gone
then
who
are
you
it
is
really
immaterial
who
am
but
since
the
matter
seems
to
interest
you
mr
von
bork
may
say
that
this
is
not
my
first
acquaintance
with
the
members
of
your
family
have
done
good
deal
of
business
in
germany
in
the
past
and
my
name
is
probably
familiar
to
you
would
wish
to
know
it
said
the
prussian
grimly
it
was
who
brought
about
the
separation
between
irene
adler
and
the
late
king
of
bohemia
when
your
cousin
heinrich
was
the
imperial
envoy
it
was
also
who
saved
from
murder
by
the
nihilist
klopman
count
von
und
zu
grafenstein
who
was
your
mother
elder
brother
it
was
i—
von
bork
sat
up
in
amazement
there
is
only
one
man
he
cried
exactly
said
holmes
von
bork
groaned
and
sank
back
on
the
sofa
and
most
of
that
information
came
through
you
he
cried
what
is
it
worth
what
have
done
it
is
my
ruin
forever
it
is
certainly
little
untrustworthy
said
holmes
it
will
require
some
checking
and
you
have
little
time
to
check
it
your
admiral
may
find
the
new
guns
rather
larger
than
he
expects
and
the
cruisers
perhaps
trifle
faster
von
bork
clutched
at
his
own
throat
in
despair
there
are
good
many
other
points
of
detail
which
will
no
doubt
come
to
light
in
good
time
but
you
have
one
quality
which
is
very
rare
in
german
mr
von
bork
you
are
sportsman
and
you
will
bear
me
no
ill
will
when
you
realize
that
you
who
have
outwitted
so
many
other
people
have
at
last
been
outwitted
yourself
after
all
you
have
done
your
best
for
your
country
and
have
done
my
best
for
mine
and
what
could
be
more
natural
besides
he
added
not
unkindly
as
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
prostrate
man
it
is
better
than
to
fall
before
some
ignoble
foe
these
papers
are
now
ready
watson
if
you
will
help
me
with
our
prisoner
think
that
we
may
get
started
for
london
at
once

it
was
no
easy
task
to
move
von
bork
for
he
was
strong
and
desperate
man
finally
holding
either
arm
the
two
friends
walked
him
very
slowly
down
the
garden
walk
which
he
had
trod
with
such
proud
confidence
when
he
received
the
congratulations
of
the
famous
diplomatist
only
few
hours
before
after
short
final
struggle
he
was
hoisted
still
bound
hand
and
foot
into
the
spare
seat
of
the
little
car
his
precious
valise
was
wedged
in
beside
him
trust
that
you
are
as
comfortable
as
circumstances
permit
said
holmes
when
the
final
arrangements
were
made
should
be
guilty
of
liberty
if
lit
cigar
and
placed
it
between
your
lips
but
all
amenities
were
wasted
upon
the
angry
german
suppose
you
realize
mr
sherlock
holmes
said
he
that
if
your
government
bears
you
out
in
this
treatment
it
becomes
an
act
of
war
what
about
your
government
and
all
this
treatment
said
holmes
tapping
the
valise
you
are
private
individual
you
have
no
warrant
for
my
arrest
the
whole
proceeding
is
absolutely
illegal
and
outrageous
absolutely
said
holmes
kidnapping
german
subject
and
stealing
his
private
papers
well
you
realize
your
position
you
and
your
accomplice
here
if
were
to
shout
for
help
as
we
pass
through
the
village—
my
dear
sir
if
you
did
anything
so
foolish
you
would
probably
enlarge
the
two
limited
titles
of
our
village
inns
by
giving
us
the
dangling
prussian
as
signpost
the
englishman
is
patient
creature
but
at
present
his
temper
is
little
inflamed
and
it
would
be
as
well
not
to
try
him
too
far
no
mr
von
bork
you
will
go
with
us
in
quiet
sensible
fashion
to
scotland
yard
whence
you
can
send
for
your
friend
baron
von
herling
and
see
if
even
now
you
may
not
fill
that
place
which
he
has
reserved
for
you
in
the
ambassadorial
suite
as
to
you
watson
you
are
joining
us
with
your
old
service
as
understand
so
london
won
be
out
of
your
way
stand
with
me
here
upon
the
terrace
for
it
may
be
the
last
quiet
talk
that
we
shall
ever
have
the
two
friends
chatted
in
intimate
converse
for
few
minutes
recalling
once
again
the
days
of
the
past
while
their
prisoner
vainly
wriggled
to
undo
the
bonds
that
held
him
as
they
turned
to
the
car
holmes
pointed
back
to
the
moonlit
sea
and
shook
thoughtful
head
there
an

watson

not
holmes
it
is
very
warm
good
old
watson
you
are
the
one
fixed
point
in
changing
age
there
an
east
wind
coming
all
the
same
such
wind
as
never
blew
on
england
yet
it
will
be
cold
and
bitter
watson
and

many
of

may
wither
before
its
blast

it

the
adventure
of
the
mazarin
stone
it
was
pleasant
to
dr
watson
to
find
himself
once
more
in
the
untidy
room
of
the
first
floor
in
baker
street
which
had
been
the
starting
point
of
so
many
remarkable
adventures
he
looked
round
him
at
the
scientific
charts
upon
the
wall
the
acid
charred
bench
of
chemicals
the
violin
case
leaning
in
the
corner
the
coal
scuttle
which
contained
of
old
the
pipes
and
tobacco
finally
his
eyes
came
round
to
the
fresh
and
smiling
face
of
billy
the
young
but
very
wise
and
tactful
page
who
had
helped
little
to
fill
up
the
gap
of
loneliness
and
isolation
which
surrounded
the
saturnine
figure
of
the
great
detective
it
all
seems
very
unchanged
billy
you
don
change
either
hope
the
same
can
be
said
of
him
billy
glanced
with
some
solicitude
at
the
closed
door
of
the
bedroom
think
he
in
bed
and
asleep
he
said
it
was
seven
in
the
evening
of
lovely
summer
day
but
dr
watson
was
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
irregularity
of
his
old
friend
hours
to
feel
no
surprise
at
the
idea
that
means
case
suppose
yes
sir
he
is
very
hard
at
it
just
now
frightened
for
his
health
he
gets
paler
and
thinner
and
he
eats
nothing
when
will
you
be
pleased
to
dine
mr
holmes
mrs
hudson
asked
seven
thirty
the
day
after
to
morrow
said
he
you
know
his
way
when
he
is
keen
on
case
yes
billy
know
he
following
someone
yesterday
he
was
out
as
workman
looking
for
job
to
day
he
was
an
old
woman
fairly
took
me
in
he
did
and
ought
to
know
his
ways
by
now
billy
pointed
with
grin
to
very
baggy
parasol
which
leaned
against
the
sofa
that
part
of
the
old
woman
outfit
he
said
but
what
is
it
all
about
billy
sank
his
voice
as
one
who
discusses
great
secrets
of
state
don
mind
telling
you
sir
but
it
should
go
no
farther
it
this
case
of
the
crown
diamond
what
the
hundred
thousand
pound
burglary
yes
sir
they
must
get
it
back
sir
why
we
had
the
prime
minister
and
the
home
secretary
both
sitting
on
that
very
sofa
mr
holmes
was
very
nice
to
them
he
soon
put
them
at
their
ease
and
promised
he
would
do
all
he
could
then
there
is
lord
cantlemere—
ah
yes
sir
you
know
what
that
means
he
stiff
un
sir
if
may
say
so
can
get
along
with
the
prime
minister
and
ve
nothing
against
the
home
secretary
who
seemed
civil
obliging
sort
of
man
but
can
stand
his
lordship
neither
can
mr
holmes
sir
you
see
he
don
believe
in
mr
holmes
and
he
was
against
employing
him
he
rather
he
failed
and
mr
holmes
knows
it
mr
holmes
always
knows
whatever
there
is
to
know
well
we
ll
hope
he
won
fail
and
that
lord
cantlemere
will
be
confounded
but
say
billy
what
is
that
curtain
for
across
the
window
mr
holmes
had
it
put
up
there
three
days
ago
we
ve
got
something
funny
behind
it
billy
advanced
and
drew
away
the
drapery
which
screened
the
alcove
of
the
bow
window
dr
watson
could
not
restrain
cry
of
amazement
there
was
facsimile
of
his
old
friend
dressing
gown
and
all
the
face
turned
three
quarters
towards
the
window
and
downward
as
though
reading
an
invisible
book
while
the
body
was
sunk
deep
in
an
armchair
billy
detached
the
head
and
held
it
in
the
air
we
put
it
at
different
angles
so
that
it
may
seem
more
lifelike
wouldn
dare
touch
it
if
the
blind
were
not
down
but
when
it
up
you
can
see
this
from
across
the
way
we
used
something
of
the
sort
once
before
my
time
said
billy
he
drew
the
window
curtains
apart
and
looked
out
into
the
street
there
are
folk
who
watch
us
from
over
yonder
can
see
fellow
now
at
the
window
have
look
for
yourself
watson
had
taken
step
forward
when
the
bedroom
door
opened
and
the
long
thin
form
of
holmes
emerged
his
face
pale
and
drawn
but
his
step
and
bearing
as
active
as
ever
with
single
spring
he
was
at
the
window
and
had
drawn
the
blind
once
more
that
will
do
billy
said
he
you
were
in
danger
of
your
life
then
my
boy
and
can
do
without
you
just
yet
well
watson
it
is
good
to
see
you
in
your
old
quarters
once
again
you
come
at
critical
moment
so
gather
you
can
go
billy
that
boy
is
problem
watson
how
far
am
justified
in
allowing
him
to
be
in
danger
of
what
holmes
of
sudden
death
expecting
something
this
evening
expecting
what
to
be
murdered
watson
no
you
are
joking
holmes
even
my
limited
sense
of
humour
could
evolve
better
joke
than
that
but
we
may
be
comfortable
in
the
meantime
may
we
not
is
alcohol
permitted
the
gasogene
and
cigars
are
in
the
old
place
let
me
see
you
once
more
in
the
customary
armchair
you
have
not
hope
learned
to
despise
my
pipe
and
my
lamentable
tobacco
it
has
to
take
the
place
of
food
these
days
but
why
not
eat
because
the
faculties
become
refined
when
you
starve
them
why
surely
as
doctor
my
dear
watson
you
must
admit
that
what
your
digestion
gains
in
the
way
of
blood
supply
is
so
much
lost
to
the
brain
am
brain
watson
the
rest
of
me
is
mere
appendix
therefore
it
is
the
brain
must
consider
but
this
danger
holmes
ah
yes
in
case
it
should
come
off
it
would
perhaps
be
as
well
that
you
should
burden
your
memory
with
the
name
and
address
of
the
murderer
you
can
give
it
to
scotland
yard
with
my
love
and
parting
blessing
sylvius
is
the
name
count
negretto
sylvius
write
it
down
man

moorside
gardens
got
it
watson
honest
face
was
twitching
with
anxiety
he
knew
only
too
well
the
immense
risks
taken
by
holmes
and
was
well
aware
that
what
he
said
was
more
likely
to
be
under
statement
than
exaggeration
watson
was
always
the
man
of
action
and
he
rose
to
the
occasion

your

watson
you
have
added
fibbing
to
your
other

you
bear
every
sign
of
the
busy
medical
man
with
calls
on
him
every
hour
not
such
important
ones
but
can
you
have
this
fellow
arrested
yes
watson
could
that
what
worries
him
so
but
why
don
you
because
don
know
where
the
diamond
is
ah
billy
told
me
the
missing
crown
jewel
yes
the
great
yellow
mazarin
stone
ve
cast
my
net
and
have
my
fish
but
have
not
got
the
stone
what
is
the
use
of
taking
them
we
can
make
the
world
better
place
by
laying
them
by
the
heels
but
that
is
not
what
am
out
for

the

this
count
sylvius
one
of
your

yes
and

sam

the
boxer
not
bad
fellow
sam

the
count

used
him
sam
not
shark
he
is
great
big
silly
bull
headed
gudgeon
but
he
is
flopping
about
in
my
net
all
the
same
where
is
this
count
sylvius
ve
been
at
his
very
elbow
all
the
morning
you
ve
seen
me
as
an
old
lady
watson
was
never
more
convincing
he
actually
picked
up
my
parasol
for
me
once
by
your
leave
madame
said
he
half
ltalian
you
know
and
with
the
southern
graces
of
manner
when
in
the
mood
but
devil
incarnate
in
the
other
mood
life
is
full
of
whimsical
happenings
watson
it
might
have
been
tragedy
well
perhaps
it
might
followed
him
to
old
straubenzee
workshop
in
the
minories
straubenzee
made
the
air
gun
very
pretty
bit
of
work
as
understand
and
rather
fancy
it
is
in
the
opposite
window
at
the
present
moment
have
you
seen
the
dummy
of
course
billy
showed
it
to
you
well
it
may
get
bullet
through
its
beautiful
head
at
any
moment
ah
billy
what
is
it
the
boy
had
reappeared
in
the
room
with
card
upon
tray
holmes
glanced
at
it
with
raised
eyebrows
and
an
amused
smile
the
man
himself
had
hardly
expected
this
grasp
the
nettle
watson
man
of
nerve
possibly
you
have
heard
of
his
reputation
as
shooter
of
big
game
it
would
indeed
be
triumphant
ending
to
his
excellent
sporting
record
if
he
added
me
to
his
bag
this
is
proof
that
he
feels
my
toe
very
close
behind
his
heel
send
for
the
police
probably
shall
but
not
just
yet
would
you
glance
carefully
out
of
the
window
watson
and
see
if
anyone
is
hanging
about
in
the
street
watson
looked
warily
round
the
edge
of
the
curtain
yes
there
is
one
rough
fellow
near
the
door
that
will
be
sam
merton
the
faithful
but
rather
fatuous
sam
where
is
this
gentleman
billy
in
the
waiting
room
sir
show
him
up
when
ring
yes
sir
if
am
not
in
the
room
show
him
in
all
the
same
yes
sir
watson
waited
until
the
door
was
closed
and
then
he
turned
earnestly
to
his
companion
look
here
holmes
this
is
simply
impossible
this
is
desperate
man
who
sticks
at
nothing
he
may
have
come
to
murder
you
should
not
be
surprised
insist
upon
staying
with
you
would
be
horribly
in
the
way
in
his
way
no
my
dear
fellow
in
my
way
well
can
possibly
leave
you
yes
you
can
watson
and
you
will
for
you
have
never
failed
to
play
the
game
am
sure
you
will
play
it
to
the
end
this
man
has
come
for
his
own
purpose
but
he
may
stay
for
mine
holmes
took
out
his
notebook
and
scribbled
few
lines
take
cab
to
scotland
yard
and
give
this
to
youghal
of
the
come
back
with
the
police
the
fellow
arrest
will
follow
ll
do
that
with
joy
before
you
return
may
have
just
time
enough
to
find
out
where
the
stone
is
he
touched
the
bell
think
we
will
go
out
through
the
bedroom
this
second
exit
is
exceedingly
useful
rather
want
to
see
my
shark
without
his
seeing
me
and
have
as
you
will
remember
my
own
way
of
doing
it
was
therefore
an
empty
room
into
which
billy
minute
later
ushered
count
sylvius
the
famous
game
shot
sportsman
and
man
about
town
was
big
swarthy
fellow
with
formidable
dark
moustache
shading
cruel
thin
lipped
mouth
and
surmounted
by
long
curved
nose
like
the
beak
of
an
eagle
he
was
well
dressed
but
his
brilliant
necktie
shining
pin
and
glittering
rings
were
flamboyant
in
their
effect
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
he
looked
round
him
with
fierce
startled
eyes
like
one
who
suspects
trap
at
every
turn
then
he
gave
violent
start
as
he
saw
the
impassive
head
and
the
collar
of
the
dressing
gown
which
projected
above
the
armchair
in
the
window
at
first
his
expression
was
one
of
pure
amazement
then
the
light
of
horrible
hope
gleamed
in
his
dark
murderous
eyes
he
took
one
more
glance
round
to
see
that
there
were
no
witnesses
and
then
on
tiptoe
his
thick
stick
half
raised
he
approached
the
silent
figure
he
was
crouching
for
his
final
spring
and
blow
when
cool
sardonic
voice
greeted
him
from
the
open
bedroom
door
don
break
it
count
don
break
it
the
assassin
staggered
back
amazement
in
his
convulsed
face
for
an
instant
he
half
raised
his
loaded
cane
once
more
as
if
he
would
turn
his
violence
from
the
effigy
to
the
original
but
there
was
something
in
that
steady
grey
eye
and
mocking
smile
which
caused
his
hand
to
sink
to
his
side
it
pretty
little
thing
said
holmes
advancing
towards
the
image
tavernier
the
french
modeller
made
it
he
is
as
good
at
waxworks
as
your
friend
straubenzee
is
at
air
guns
air
guns
sir
what
do
you
mean
put
your
hat
and
stick
on
the
side
table
thank
you
pray
take
seat
would
you
care
to
put
your
revolver
out
also
oh
very
good
if
you
prefer
to
sit
upon
it
your
visit
is
really
most
opportune
for
wanted
badly
to
have
few
minutes
chat
with
you
the
count
scowled
with
heavy
threatening
eyebrows
too
wished
to
have
some
words
with
you
holmes
that
is
why
am
here
won
deny
that
intended
to
assault
you
just
now
holmes
swung
his
leg
on
the
edge
of
the
table
rather
gathered
that
you
had
some
idea
of
the
sort
in
your
head
said
he
but
why
these
personal
attentions
because
you
have
gone
out
of
your
way
to
annoy
me
because
you
have
put
your
creatures
upon
my
track
my
creatures
assure
you
no
nonsense
have
had
them
followed
two
can
play
at
that
game
holmes
it
is
small
point
count
sylvius
but
perhaps
you
would
kindly
give
me
my
prefix
when
you
address
me
you
can
understand
that
with
my
routine
of
work
should
find
myself
on
familiar
terms
with
half
the
rogues
gallery
and
you
will
agree
that
exceptions
are
invidious
well
mr
holmes
then
excellent
but
assure
you
are
mistaken
about
my
alleged
agents
count
sylvius
laughed
contemptuously
other
people
can
observe
as
well
as
you
yesterday
there
was
an
old
sporting
man
to
day
it
was
an
elderly
woman
they
held
me
in
view
all
day
really
sir
you
compliment
me
old
baron
dowson
said
the
night
before
he
was
hanged
that
in
my
case
what
the
law
had
gained
the
stage
had
lost
and
now
you
give
my
little
impersonations
your
kindly
praise
it
was
you
yourself
holmes
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
can
see
in
the
corner
the
parasol
which
you
so
politely
handed
to
me
in
the
minories
before
you
began
to
suspect
if
had
known
you
might
never—
have
seen
this
humble
home
again
was
well
aware
of
it
we
all
have
neglected
opportunities
to
deplore
as
it
happens
you
did
not
know
so
here
we
are
the
count
knotted
brows
gathered
more
heavily
over
his
menacing
eyes
what
you
say
only
makes
the
matter
worse
it
was
not
your
agents
but
your
play
acting
busybody
self
you
admit
that
you
have
dogged
me
why
come
now
count
you
used
to
shoot
lions
in
algeria
well
but
why
the
sport
the
excitement
the
danger
and
no
doubt
to
free
the
country
from
pest
exactly
my
reasons
in
nutshell
the
count
sprang
to
his
feet
and
his
hand
involuntarily
moved
back
to
his
hip
pocket
sit
down
sir
sit
down
there
was
another
more
practical
reason
want
that
yellow
diamond
count
sylvius
lay
back
in
his
chair
with
an
evil
smile
upon
my
word
said
he
you
knew
that
was
after
you
for
that
the
real
reason
why
you
are
here
to
night
is
to
find
out
how
much
know
about
the
matter
and
how
far
my
removal
is
absolutely
essential
well
should
say
that
from
your
point
of
view
it
is
absolutely
essential
for
know
all
about
it
save
only
one
thing
which
you
are
about
to
tell
me
oh
indeed
and
pray
what
is
this
missing
fact
where
the
crown
diamond
now
is

the
count
looked
sharply
at
his
companion
oh
you
want
to
know
that
do
you
how
the
devil
should
be
able
to
lell
you
where
it
is
you
can
and
you
will
indeed
you
can
bluff
me
count
sylvius
holmes
eyes
as
he
gazed
at
him
contracted
and
lightened
until
they
were
like
two
menacing
points
of
steel
you
are
absolute
plate
glass
see
to
the
very
back
of
your
mind
then
of
course
you
see
where
the
diamond
is
holmes
clapped
his
hands
with
amusement
and
then
pointed
derisive
finger
then
you
do
know
you
have
admitted
it
admit
nothing
now
count
if
you
will
be
reasonable
we
can
do
business
if
not
you
will
get
hurt
count
sylvius
threw
up
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
and
you
talk
about
bluff
said
he
holmes
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
like
master
chess
player
who
meditates
his
crowning
move
then
he
threw
open
the
table
drawer
and
drew
out
squat
notebook

this
book

out

his
dark
hairy
hands
were
clenched

convulsion

restrained
emotion

tried
to
speak

the
words
would
not

it
all
upon
the
table
but
one
card
is
missing

the
king
of
diamonds

know
where
the
stone

you
never
shall
know
no
now
be
reasonable

the
situation
you
are
going
to
be
locked
up
for
twenty
years
so
is
sam
merton
what
good
are
you
going
to
get
out
of
your
diamond
none
in
the
world
but
if
you

it
over
well
ll
compound
felony
we
don
want
you
or
sam
we
want
the
stone

that
up
and
so
far
as
am
concerned
you
can
go
free
so
long
as
you
behave
yourself
in
the
future
if
you
make
another
slip
well
it
will
be
the
last
but
this
time
my
commission
is
to
get
the
stone
not
you
but
if
refuse
why
then
alas
it
must
be
you
and
not
the
stone
billy
had
appeared
in
answer
to
ring
think
count
that
it
would
be
as
well
to
have
your
friend
sam
at
this
conference
after
all
his
interests
should
be
represented
billy
you
will
see
large
and
ugly
gentleman
outside
the
front
door
ask
him
to
come
up
if
he
won
come
sir
no
violence
billy
don
be
rough
with
him
if
you
tell
him
that
count
sylvius
wants
him
he
will
certainly
come
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
asked
the
count
as
billy
disappeared
my
friend
watson
was
with
me
just
now
told
him
that
had
shark
and
gudgeon
in
my
net
now
am
drawing
the
net
and
up
they
come
together
the
count
had
risen
from
his
chair
and
his
hand
was
behind
his
back
holmes
held
something
half
protruding
from
the
pocket
of
his
dressing
gown
you
won
die
in
your
bed
holmes
have
often
had
the
same
idea
does
it
matter
very
much
aher
all
count
your
own
exit
is
more
likely
to
be
perpendicular
than
horizontal
but
these
anticipations
of
the
future
are
morbid
why
not
give
ourselves
up
to
the
unrestrained
enjoyment
of
the
present
sudden
wild
beast
light
sprang
up
in
the
dark
menacing
eyes
of
the
master
criminal
holmes
figure
seemed
to
grow
taller
as
he
grew
tense
and
ready
it
is
no
use
your
fingering
your
revolver
my
friend
he
said
in
quiet
voice
you
know
perfectly
well
that
you
dare
not
use
it
even
if
gave
you
time
to
draw
it
nasty
noisy
things
revolvers
count
better
stick
to
air
guns
ah
think
hear
the
fairy
footstep
of
your
estimable
partner
good
day
mr
merton
rather
dull
in
the
street
is
it
not
the
prize
fighter
heavily
built
young
man
with
stupid
obstinate
slab
sided
face
stood
awkwardly
at
the
door
looking
about
him
with
puzzled
expression
holmes
debonair
manner
was
new
experience
and
though
he
vaguely
felt
that
it
was
hostile
he
did
not
know
how
to
counter
it
he
turned
to
his
more
astute
comrade
for
help
what
the
game
now
count
what
this
fellow
want
what
up
his
voice
was
deep
and
raucous
the
count
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
it
was
holmes
who
answered
if
may
put
it
in
nutshell
mr
merton
should
say
it
was
all
up
the
boxer
still
addressed
his
remarks
to
his
associate
is
this
cove
trying
to
be
funny
or
what
not
in
the
funny
mood
myself
no
expect
not
said
holmes
think
can
promise
you
that
you
will
feel
even
less
humorous
as
the
evening
advances
now
look
here
count
sylvius
busy
man
and
can
waste
time
going
into
that
bedroom
pray
make
yourselves
quite
at
home
in
my
absence
you
can
explain
to
your
friend
how
the
matter
lies
without
the
restraint
of
my
presence
shall
try
over
the
hoffman
barcarole
upon
my
violin
in
five
minutes
shall
return
for
your
final
answer
you
quite
grasp
the
alternative
do
you
not
shall
we
take
you
or
shall
we
have
the
stone
holmes
withdrew
picking
up
his
violin
from
the
corner
as
he
passed
few
moments
later
the
long
drawn
wailing
notes
of
that
most
haunting
of
tunes
came
faintly
through
the
closed
door
of
the
bedroom
what
is
it
then
asked
merton
anxiously
as
his
companion
turned
to
him
does
he
know
about
the
stone
he
knows
damned
sight
too
much
about
it
not
sure
that
he
doesn
know
all
about
it
good
lord
the
boxer
sallow
face
turned
shade
whiter
ikey
sanders
has
split
on
us
he
has
he
ll
do
him
down
thick
un
for
that
if
swing
for
it
that
won
help
us
much
we
ve
got
to
make
up
our
minds
what
to
do
half
mo
said
the
boxer
looking
suspiciously
at
the
bedroom
door
he
leary
cove
that
wants
watching
suppose
he
not
listening
how
can
he
be
listening
with
that
music
going
that
right
maybe
somebody
behind
curtain
too
many
curtains
in
this
room
as
he
looked
round
he
suddenly
saw
for
the
first
time
the
effigy
in
the
window
and
stood
staring
and
pointing
too
amazed
for
words
tut
it
only
dummy
said
the
count
fake
is
it
well
strike
me
madame
tussaud
ain
in
it
the
living
spit
of
him
gown
and
all
but
them
curtains
count
oh
confound
the
curtains
we
are
wasting
our
time
and
there
is
none
too
much
he
can
lag
us
over
this
stone
the
deuce
he
can
but
he
ll
let
us
slip
if
we
only
tell
him
where
the
swag
is
what
give
it
up
give
up
hundred
thousand
quid
it
one
or
the
other
merton
scratched
his
short
cropped
pate
he
alone
in
there
let
do
him
in
if
his
light
were
out
we
should
have
nothing
to
fear
the
count
shook
his
head
he
is
armed
and
ready
if
we
shot
him
we
could
hardly
get
away
in
place
like
this
besides
it
likely
enough
that
the
police
know
whatever
evidence
he
has
got
hallo
what
was
that
there
was
vague
sound
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
window
both
men
sprang
round
but
all
was
quiet
save
for
the
one
strange
figure
seated
in
the
chair
the
room
was
certainly
empty
something
in
the
street
said
merton
now
look
here
guv
nor
you
ve
got
the
brains
surely
you
can
think
way
out
of
it
if
slugging
is
no
use
then
it
up
to
you
ve
fooled
better
men
than
he
the
count
answered
the
stone
is
here
in
my
secret
pocket
take
no
chances
leaving
it
about
it
can
be
out
of
england
to
night
and
cut
into
four
pieces
in
amsterdam
before

van
seddar
was
going
next
week
he
was
but
now
he
must
get
off
by
the
next
boat
one
or
other
of
us
must
slip
round
with
the
stone
to
lime
street
and
tell
him
but
the
false
bottom
ain
ready
well
he
must
take
it
as
it
is
and
chance
it
there
not
moment
to
lose
again
with
the
sense
of
danger
which
becomes
an
instinct
with
the
sportsman
he
paused
and
looked
hard
at
the
window
yes
it
was
surely
from
the
street
that
the
faint
sound
had
come
as
to
holmes
he
continued
we
can
fool
him
easily
enough
you
see
the
damned
fool
won
arrest
us
if
he
can
get
the
stone
well
we
ll
promise
him
the
stone
we
ll
put
him
on
the
wrong
track
about
it
and
before
he
finds
that
it
is
the
wrong
track
it
will
be
in
holland
and
we
out
of
the
country
that
sounds
good
to
me
cried
sam
merton
with
grin
you
go
on
and
tell
the
dutchman
to
get
move
on
him
ll
see
this
sucker
and
fill
him
up
with
bogus
confession
ll
tell
him
that
the
stone
is
in
liverpool
confound
that
whining
music
it
gets
on
my
nerves
by
the
time
he
finds
it
isn
in
liverpool
it
will
be
in
quarters
and
we
on
the
blue
water
come
back
here
out
of
line
with
that
keyhole
here
is
the
stone
wonder
you
dare
carry
it
where
could
have
it
safer
if
we
could
take
it
out
of
whitehall
someone
else
could
surely
take
it
out
of
my
lodgings
let
have
look
at
it
count
sylvius
cast
somewhat
unflattering
glance
at
his
associate
and
disregarded
the
unwashed
hand
which
was
extended
towards
him
what
ye
think
going
to
snatch
it
off
you
see
here
mister
getting
bit
tired
of
your
ways
well
no
offence
sam
we
can
afford
to
quarrel
come
over
to
the
window
if
you
want
to
see
the
beauty
properly
now
hold
it
to
the
light
here
thank
you
with
single
spring
holmes
had
leaped
from
the
dummy
chair
and
had
grasped
the
precious
jewel
he
held
it
now
in
one
hand
while
his
other
pointed
revolver
at
the
count
head
the
two
villains
staggered
back
in
utter
amazement
before
they
had
recovered
holmes
had
pressed
the
electric
bell
no
violence
gentlemen
no
violence
beg
of
you
consider
the
furniture
it
must
be
very
clear
to
you
that
your
position
is
an
impossible
one
the
police
are
waiting
below
the
count
bewilderment
overmastered
his
rage
and
fear
but
how
the
deuce—
he
gasped
your
surprise
is
very
natural
you
are
not
aware
that
second
door
from
my
bedroom
leads
behind
that
curtain
fancied
that
you
must
have
heard
me
when
displaced
the
figure
but
luck
was
on
my
side
it
gave
me
chance
of
listening
to
your
racy
conversation
which
would
have
been
painfully
constrained
had
you
been
aware
of
my
presence
the
count
gave
gesture
of
resignation
we
give
you
best
holmes
believe
you
are
the
devil
himself
not
far
from
him
at
any
rate
holmes
answered
with
polite
smile
sam
merton
slow
intellect
had
only
gradually
appreciated
the
situation
now
as
the
sound
of
heavy
steps
came
from
the
stairs
outside
he
broke
silence
at
last
fair
cop
said
he
but
say
what
about
that
bloomin
fiddle
hear
it
yet
tut
holmes
answered
you
are
perfectly
right
let
it
play
these
modern
gramophones
are
remarkable
invention
there
was
an
inrush
of
police
the
handcuffs
clicked
and
the
criminals
were
led
to
the
waiting
cab
watson
lingered
with
holmes
congratulating
him
upon
this
fresh
leaf
added
to
his
laurels
once
more
their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
imperturbable
billy
with
his
card
tray
lord
cantlemere
sir
show
him
up
billy
this
is
the
eminent
peer
who
represents
the
very
highest
interests
said
holmes
he
is
an
excellent
and
loyal
person
but
rather
of
the
old
regime
shall
we
make
him
unbend
dare
we
venture
upon
slight
liberty
he
knows
we
may
conjecture
nothing
of
what
has
occurred
the
door
opened
to
admit
thin
austere
figure
with
hatchet
face
and
drooping
mid
victorian
whiskers
of
glossy
blackness
which
hardly
corresponded
with
the
rounded
shoulders
and
feeble
gait
holmes
advanced
affably
and
shook
an
unresponsive
hand
how
do
you
do
lord
cantlemere
it
is
chilly
for
the
time
of
year
but
rather
warm
indoors
may
take
your
overcoat
no
thank
you
will
not
take
it
off
holmes
laid
his
hand
insistently
upon
the
sleeve
pray
allow
me
my
friend
dr
watson
would
assure
you
that
these
changes
of
temperature
are
most
insidious
his
lordship
shook
himself
free
with
some
impatience
am
quite
comfortable
sir
have
no
need
to
stay
have
simply
looked
in
to
know
how
your
self
appointed
task
was
progressing
it
is
difficult
very
difficult
feared
that
you
would
find
it
so
there
was
distinct
sneer
in
the
old
courtier
words
and
manner
every
man
finds
his
limitations
mr
holmes
but
at
least
it
cures
us
of
the
weakness
of
self
satisfaction
yes
sir
have
been
much
perplexed
no
doubt
especially
upon
one
point
possibly
you
could
help
me
upon
you
apply
for
my
advice
rather
late
in
the
day
thought
that
you
had
your
own
all
sufficient
methods
still
am
ready
to
help
you
see
lord
cantlemere
we
can
no
doubt
frame
case
against
the
actual
thieves
when
you
have
caught
them
exactly
but
the
question
is
how
shall
we
proceed
against
the
receiver
is
this
not
rather
premature
it
is
as
well
to
have
our
plans
ready
now
what
would
you
regard
as
final
evidence
against
the
receiver
the
actual
possession
of
the
stone
you
would
arrest
him
upon
that
most
undoubtedly
holmes
seldom
laughed
but
he
got
as
near
it
as
his
old
friend
watson
could
remember
in
that
case
my
dear
sir
shall
be
under
the
painful
necessity
of
advising
your
arrest
lord
cantlemere
was
very
angry
some
of
the
ancient
fires
flickered
up
into
his
sallow
cheeks
you
take
great
liberty
mr
holmes
in
fifty
years
of
official
life
cannot
recall
such
case
am
busy
man
sir
engaged
upon
important
affairs
and
have
no
time
or
taste
for
foolish
jokes
may
tell
you
frankly
sir
that
have
never
been
believer
in
your
powers
and
that
have
always
been
of
the
opinion
that
the
matter
was
far
safer
in
the
hands
of
the
regular
police
force
your
conduct
confirms
all
my
conclusions
have
the
honour
sir
to
wish
you
good
evening
holmes
had
swiftly
changed
his
position
and
was
between
the
peer
and
the
door
one
moment
sir
said
he
to
actually
go
off
with
the
mazarin
stone
would
be
more
serious
offence
than
to
be
found
in
temporary
possession
of
it
sir
this
is
intolerable
let
me
pass
put
your
hand
in
the
right
hand
pocket
of
your
overcoat
what
do
you
mean
sir
come
do
what
ask
an
instant
later
the
amazed
peer
was
standing
blinking
and
stammering
with
the
great
yellow
stone
on
his
shaking
palm
what
how
is
this
mr
holmes
too
bad
lord
cantlemere
too
bad
cried
holmes
my
old
friend
here
will
tell
you
that
have
an
impish
habit
of
practical
joking
also
that
can
never
resist
dramatic
situation
took
the
liberty
the
very
great
liberty
admit
of
putting
the
stone
into
your
pocket
at
the
beginning
of
our
interview
the
old
peer
stared
from
the
stone
to
the
smiling
face
before
him
sir
am
bewildered
but
yes
it
is
indeed
the
mazarin
stone
we
are
greatly
your
debtors
mr
holmes
your
sense
of
humour
may
as
you
admit
be
somewhat
perverted
and
its
exhibition
remarkably
untimely
but
at
least
withdraw
any
reflection
have
made
upon
your
amazing
professional
powers
but
how—
the
case
is
but
half
finished
the
details
can
wait
no
doubt
lord
cantlemere
your
pleasure
in
telling
of
this
successful
result
in
the
exalted
circle
to
which
you
return
will
be
some
small
atonement
for
my
practical
joke
billy
you
will
show
his
lordship
out
and
tell
mrs
hudson
that
should
be
glad
if
she
would
send
up
dinner
for
two
as
soon
as
possible
ii
the
problem
of
thor
bridge
somewhere
in
the
vaults
of
the
bank
of
cox
and
co
at
charing
cross
there
is
travel
worn
and
battered
tin
dispatchbox
with
my
name
john
watson
late
indian
army
painted
upon
the
lid
it
is
crammed
with
papers
nearly
all
of
which
are
records
of
cases
to
illustrate
the
curious
problems
which
mr
sherlock
holmes
had
at
various
times
to
examine
some
and
not
the
least
interesting
were
complete
failures
and
as
such
will
hardly
bear
narrating
since
no
final
explanation
is
forthcoming
problem
without
solution
may
interest
the
student
but
can
hardly
fail
to
annoy
the
casual
reader
among
these
unfinished
tales
is
that
of
mr
james
phillimore
who
stepping
back
into
his
own
house
to
get
his
umbrella
was
never
more
seen
in
this
world
no
less
remarkable
is
that
of
the
cutter
alicia
which
sailed
one
spring
morning
into
small
patch
of
mist
from
where
she
never
again
emerged
nor
was
anything
further
ever
heard
of
herself
and
her
crew
third
case
worthy
of
note
is
that
of
isadora
persano
the
well
known
journalist
and
duellist
who
was
found
stark
staring
mad
with
match
box
in
front
of
him
which
contained
remarkable
worm
said
to
be
unknown
to
science
apart
from
these
unfathomed
cases
there
are
some

which
would
mean
consternation
in
many
exalted
quarters
if
it
were

possible
that
they

their

need
not
say
that
such
breach
of
confidence
is
unthinkable
and
that
these
records
will
be
separated
and
destroyed
now
that
my
friend
has
time
to
turn
his
energies
to
the
matter
there
remain
considerable
residue
of
cases
of
greater

less
interest

might
have
edited
before
had
not
feared
to
give
the
public
surfeit

the
reputation
of
the
man
whom
above
all
others
revere
in
some
was
myself
concerned
and
can
speak
as
an
eye
witness
while
in
others
was
either
not

played
so
small

it
was
wild
morning
in
october
and
observed
as
was
dressing
how
the
last
remaining
leaves
were
being
whirled
from
the
solitary
plane
tree
which
graces
the
yard
behind
our
house
descended
to
breakfast
prepared
to
find
my
companion
in
depressed
spirits
for
like
all
great
artists
he
was
easily
impressed
by
his
surroundings
on
the
contrary
found
that
he
had
nearly
finished
his
meal
and
that
his
mood
was
particularly
bright
and
joyous
with
that
somewhat
sinister
cheerfulness
which
was
characteristic
of
his
lighter
moments
you
have
case
holmes
remarked
the
faculty
of
deduction
is
certainly
contagious
watson
he
answered
it
has
enabled
you
to
probe
my
secret
yes
have
case
after
month
of
trivialities
and
stagnation
the
wheels
move
once
more
might
share
it
there
is
little
to
share
but
we
may
discuss
it
when
you
have
consumed
the
two
hard
boiled
eggs
with
which
our
new
cook
has
favoured
us
their
condition
may
not
be
unconnected
with
the
copy
of
the
family
herald
which
observed
yesterday
upon
the
hall
table
even
so
trivial
matter
as
cooking
an
egg
demands
an
attention
which
is
conscious
of
the
passage
of
time
and
incompatible
with
the
love
romance
in
that
excellent
periodical
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
table
had
been
cleared
and
we
were
face
to
face
he
had
drawn
letter
from
his
pocket
you
have
heard
of
neil
gibson
the
gold
king
he
said
you
mean
the
american
senator
well
he
was
once
senator
for
some
western
state
but
is
better
known
as
the
greatest
gold
mining
magnate
in
the
world
yes
know
of
him
he
has
surely
lived
in
england
for
some
time
his
name
is
very
familiar
yes
he
bought
considerable
estate
in
hampshire
some
five
years
ago
possibly
you
have
already
heard
of
the
tragic
end
of
his
wife
of
course
remember
it
now
that
is
why
the
name
is
familiar
but
really
know
nothing
of
the
details
holmes
waved
his
hand
towards
some
papers
on
chair
had
no
idea
that
the
case
was
coming
my
way
or
should
have
had
my
extracts
ready
said
he
the
fact
is
that
the
problem
though
exceedingly
sensational
appeared
to
present
no
difficulty
the
interesting
personality
of
the
accused
does
not
obscure
the
clearness
of
the
evidence
that
was
the
view
taken
by
the
coroner
jury
and
also
in
the
police
court
proceedings
it
is
now
referred
to
the
assizes
at
winchester
fear
it
is
thankless
business
can
discover
facts
watson
but
cannot
change
them
unless
some
entirely
new
and
unexpected
ones
come
to
light
do
not
see
what
my
client
can
hope
for
your
client
ah
forgot
had
not
told
you
am
getting
into
your
involved
habit
watson
of
telling
story
backward
you
had
best
read
this
first
the
letter
which
he
handed
to
me
written
in
bold
masterful
hand

claridge
hotel
october
3rd
dear
mr
sherlock
holmes
can
see
the
best
woman
god
ever
made
go
to
her
death
without
doing
all
that
is
possible
to
save
her
can
explain
things
can
even
try
to
explain
them
but
know
beyond
all
doubt
that
miss
dunbar
is
innocent
you
know
the
facts
who
doesn
it
has
been
the
gossip
of
the
country
and
never
voice
raised
for
her
it
the
damned
injustice
of
it
all
that
makes
me
crazy
that
woman
has
heart
that
wouldn
let
her
kill
fly
well
ll
come
at
eleven
to
morrow
and
see
if
you
can
get
some
ray
of
light
in
the
dark
maybe
have
clue
and
don
know
it
anyhow
all
know
and
all
have
and
all
am
are
for
your
use
if
only
you
can
save
her
if
ever
in
your
life
you
showed
your
powers
put
them
now
into
this
case
yours
faithfully
neil
gibson
there
you
have
it
said
sherlock
holmes
knocking
out
the
ashes
of
his
after
breakfast
pipe
and
slowly
refilling
it
that
is
the
gentleman
await
as
to
the
story
you
have
hardly
time
to
master
all
these
papers
so
must
give
it
to
you
in
nutshell
if
you
are
to
take
an
intelligent
interest
in
the
proceedings
this
man
is
the
greatest
financial
power
in
the
world
and
man
as
understand
of
most
violent
and
formidable
character
he
married
wife
the
victim
of
this
tragedy
of
whom
know
nothing
save
that
she
was
past
her
prime
which
was
the
more
unfortunate
as
very
attractive
governess
superintended
the
education
of
two
young
children
these
are
the
three
people
concerned
and
the
scene
is
grand
old
manor
house
the
centre
of
historical
english
state
then
as
to
the
tragedy
the
wife
was
found
in
the
grounds
nearly
half
mile
from
the
house
late
at
night
clad
in
her
dinner
dress
with
shawl
over
her
shoulders
and
revolver
bullet
through
her
brain
no
weapon
was
found
near
her
and
there
was
no
local
clue
as
to
the
murder
no
weapon
near
her
watson
mark
that
the
crime
seems
to
have
been
committed
late
in
the
evening
and
the
body
was
found
by
gamekeeper
about
eleven
clock
when
it
was
examined
by
the
police
and
by
doctor
before
being
carried
up
to
the
house
is
this
too
condensed
or
can
you
follow
it
clearly
it
is
all
very
clear
but
why
suspect
the
governess
well
in
the
first
place
there
is
some
very
direct
evidence
revolver
with
one
discharged
chamber
and
calibre
which
corresponded
with
the
bullet
was
found
on
the
floor
of
her
wardrobe
his
eyes
fixed
and
he
repeated
in
broken
words
on
the
floor
of
her—
wardrobe
then
he
sank
into
silence
and
saw
that
some
train
of
thought
had
been
set
moving
which
should
be
foolish
to
interrupt
suddenly
with
start
he
emerged
into
brisk
life
once
more
yes
watson
it
was
found
pretty
damning
eh
so
the
two
juries
thought
then
the
dead
woman
had
note
upon
her
making
an
appointment
at
that
very
place
and
signed
by
the
governess
how
that
finally
there
is
the
motive
senator
gibson
is
an
attractive
person
if
his
wife
dies
who
more
likely
to
succeed
her
than
the
young
lady
who
had
already
by
all
accounts
received
pressing
attentions
from
her
employer
love
fortune
power
all
depending
upon
one
middleaged
life
ugly
watson—
very
ugly
yes
indeed
holmes
nor
could
she
prove
an
alibi
on
the
contrary
she
had
to
admit
that
she
was
down
near
thor
bridge
that
was
the
scene
of
the
tragedy—
about
that
hour
she
couldn
deny
it
for
some
passing
villager
had
seen
her
there
that
really
seems
final
and
yet
watson
and
yet
this
bridge
single
broad
span
of
stone
with
balustraded
sides
carries
the
drive
over
the
narrowest
part
of
long
deep
reed
girt
sheet
of
water
thor
mere
it
is
called
in
the
mouth
of
the
bridge
lay
the
dead
woman
such
are
the
main
facts
but
here
if
mistake
not
is
our
client
considerably
before
his
time
billy
had
opened
the
door
but
the
name
which
he
announced
was
an
unexpected
one
mr
marlow
bates
was
stranger
to
both
of
us
he
was
thin
nervous
wisp
of
man
with
frightened
eyes
and
twitching
hesitating
manner
man
whom
my
own
professional
eye
would
judge
to
be
on
the
brink
of
an
absolute
nervous
breakdown
you
seem
agitated
mr
bates
said
holmes
pray
sit
down
fear
can
only
give
you
short
time
for
have
an
appointment
at
eleven
know
you
have
our
visitor
gasped
shooting
out
short
sentences
like
man
who
is
out
of
breath
mr
gibson
is
coming
mr
gibson
is
my
employer
am
manager
of
his
estate
mr
holmes
he
is
villain—
an
infernal
villain
strong
language
mr
bates
have
to
be
emphatic
mr
holmes
for
the
time
is
so
limited
would
not
have
him
find
me
here
for
the
world
he
is
almost
due
now
but
was
so
situated
that
could
not
come
earlier
his
secretary
mr
ferguson
only
told
me
this
morning
of
his
appointment
with
you
and
you
are
his
manager
have
given
him
notice
in
couple
of
weeks
shall
have
shaken
off
his
accursed
slavery
hard
man
mr
holmes
hard
to
all
about
him
those
public
charities
are
screen
to
cover
his
private
iniquities
but
his
wife
was
his
chief
victim
he
was
brutal
to
her
yes
sir
brutal
how
she
came
by
her
death
do
not
know
but
am
sure
that
he
had
made
her
life
misery
to
her
she
was
creature
of
the
tropics
brazilian
by
birth
as
no
doubt
you
know
no
it
had
escaped
me
tropical
by
birth
and
tropical
by
nature
child
of
the
sun
and
of
passion
she
had
loved
him
as
such
women
can
love
but
when
her
own
physical
charms
had
faded
am
told
that
they
once
were
great—
there
was
nothing
to
hold
him
we
all
liked
her
and
felt
for
her
and
hated
him
for
the
way
that
he
treated
her
but
he
is
plausible
and
cunning
that
is
all
have
to
say
to
you
don
take
him
at
his
face
value
there
is
more
behind
now
ll
go
no
don
detain
me
he
is
almost
due
with
frightened
look
at
the
clock
our
strange
visitor
literally
ran
to
the
door
and
disappeared
well
said
holmes
after
an
interval
of
silence
mr
gibson
seems
to
have
nice
loyal
household
but
the
warning
is
useful
one
and
now
we
can
only
wait
till
the
man
himself
appears

sharp
at
the
hour
we
heard
heavy
step
upon
the
stairs
and
the
famous
millionaire
was
shown
into
the
room
as
looked
upon
him
understood
not
only
the
fears
and
dislike
of
his
manager
but
also
the
execrations
which
so
many
business
rivals
have
heaped
upon
his
head
if
were
sculptor
and
desired
to
idealize
the
successful
man
of
affairs
iron
of
nerve
and
leathery
of
conscience
should
choose
mr
neil
gibson
as
my
model
his
tall
gaunt
craggy
figure
had
suggestion
of
hunger
and
rapacity
an
abraham
lincoln
keyed
to
base
uses
instead
of
high
ones
would
give
some
idea
of
the
man
his
face
might
have
been
chiselled
in
granite
hard
set
craggy
remorseless
with
deep
lines
upon
it
the
scars
of
many
crisis
cold
grey
eyes
looking
shrewdly
out
from
under
bristling
brows
surveyed
us
each
in
turn
he
bowed
in
perfunctory
fashion
as
holmes
mentioned
my
name
and
then
with
masterful
air
of
possession
he
drew
chair
up
to
my
companion
and
seated
himself
with
his
bony
knees
almost
touching
him
let
me
say
right
here
mr
holmes
he
began
that
money
is
nothing
to
me
in
this
case
you
can
burn
it
if
it
any
use
in
lighting
you
to
the
truth
this
woman
is
innocent
and
this
woman
has
to
be
cleared
and
it
up
to
you
to
do
it
name
your
figure
my
professional
charges
are
upon
fixed
scale
said
holmes
coldly
do
not
vary
them
save
when
remit
them
altogether
well
if
dollars
make
no
difference
to
you
think
of
the
reputation
if
you
pull
this
off
every
paper
in
england
and
america
will
be
booming
you
ll
be
the
talk
of
two
continents
thank
you
mr
gibson
do
not
think
that
am
in
need
of
booming
it
may
surprise
you
to
know
that
prefer
to
work
anonymously
and
that
it
is
the
problem
itself
which
attracts
me
but
we
are
wasting
time
let
us
get
down
to
the
facts
think
that
you
will
find
all
the
main
ones
in
the
press
reports
don
know
that
can
add
anything
which
will
help
you
but
if
there
is
anything
you
would
wish
more
light
upon
well
am
here
to
give
it
well
there
is
just
one
point
what
is
it
what
were
the
exact
relations
between
you
and
miss
dunbar
the
gold
king
gave
violent
start
and
half
rose
from
his
chair
then
his
massive
calm
came
back
to
him
suppose
you
are
within
your
rights
and
maybe
doing
your
duty—
in
asking
such
question
mr
holmes
we
will
agree
to
suppose
so
said
holmes
then
can
assure
you
that
our
relations
were
entirely
and
always
those
of
an
employer
towards
young
lady
whom
he
never
conversed
with
or
ever
saw
save
when
she
was
in
the
company
of
his
children
holmes
rose
from
his
chair
am
rather
busy
man
mr
gibson
said
he
and
have
no
time
or
taste
for
aimless
conversations
wish
you
goodmorning
our
visitor
had
risen
also
and
his
great
loose
figure
towered
above
holmes
there
was
an
angry
gleam
from
under
those
bristling
brows
and
tinge
of
colour
in
the
sallow
cheeks
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
by
this
mr
holmes
do
you
dismiss
my
case
well
mr
gibson
at
least
dismiss
you
should
have
thought
my
words
were
plain
enough
but
what
at
the
back
of
it
raising
the
price
on
me
or
afraid
to
tackle
it
or
what
ve
right
to
plain
answer
well
perhaps
you
have
said
holmes
ll
give
you
one
this
case
is
quite
sufficiently
complicated
to
start
with
without
the
further
difficulty
of
false
information
meaning
that
lie
well
was
trying
to
express
it
as
delicately
as
could
but
if
you
insist
upon
the
word
will
not
contradict
you
sprang
to
my
feet
for
the
expression
upon
the
millionaire
face
was
fiendish
in
its
intensity
and
he
had
raised
his
great
knotted
fist
holmes
smiled
languidly
and
reached
his
hand
out
for
his
pipe
don
be
noisy
mr
gibson
find
that
after
breakfast
even
the
smallest
argument
is
unsettling
suggest
that
stroll
in
the
morning
air
and
little
quiet
thought
will
be
greatly
to
your
advantage
with
an
effort
the
gold
king
mastered
his
fury
could
not
but
admire
him
for
by
supreme
self
command
he
had
turned
in
minute
from
hot
flame
of
anger
to
frigid
and
contemptuous
indifference
well
it
your
choice
guess
you
know
how
to
run
your
own
business
can
make
you
touch
the
case
against
your
will
you
ve
done
yourself
no
good
this
morning
mr
holmes
for
have
broken
stronger
men
than
you
no
man
ever
crossed
me
and
was
the
better
for
it
so
many
have
said
so
and
yet
here
am
said
holmes
smiling
well
good
morning
mr
gibson
you
have
good
deal
yet
to
learn
our
visitor
made
noisy
exit
but
holmes
smoked
in
imperturbable
silence
with
dreamy
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ceiling
any
views
watson
he
asked
at
last
well
holmes
must
confess
that
when
consider
that
this
is
man
who
would
certainly
brush
any
obstacle
from
his
path
and
when
remember
that
his
wife
may
have
been
an
obstacle
and
an
object
of
dislike
as
that
man
bates
plainly
told
us
it
seems
to
me—
exactly
and
to
me
also
but
what
were
his
relations
with
the
governess
and
how
did
you
discover
them
bluff
watson
bluff
when
considered
the
passionate
unconventional
unbusinesslike
tone
of
his
letter
and
contrasted
it
with
his
self
contained
manner
and
appearance
it
was
pretty
clear
that
there
was
some
deep
emotion
which
centred
upon
the
accused
woman
rather
than
upon
the
victim
we
ve
got
to
understand
the
exact
relations
of
those
three
people
if
we
are
to
reach
the
truth
you
saw
the
frontal
attack
which
made
upon
him
and
how
imperturbably
he
received
it
then
bluffed
him
by
giving
him
the
impression
that
was
absolutely
certain
when
in
reality
was
only
extremely
suspicious
perhaps
he
will
come
back
he
is
sure
to
come
back
he
must
come
back
he
can
leave
it
where
it
is
ha
isn
that
ring
yes
there
is
his
footstep
well
mr
gibson
was
just
saying
to
dr
watson
that
you
were
somewhat
overdue
the
gold
king
had
reentered
the
room
in
more
chastened
mood
than
he
had
left
it
his
wounded
pride
still
showed
in
his
resentful
eyes
but
his
common
sense
had
shown
him
that
he
must
yield
if
he
would
attain
his
end
ve
been
thinking
it
over
mr
holmes
and
feel
that
have
been
hasty
in
taking
your
remarks
amiss
you
are
justified
in
getting
down
to
the
facts
whatever
they
may
be
and
think
the
more
of
you
for
it
can
assure
you
however
that
the
relations
between
miss
dunbar
and
me
don
really
touch
this
case
that
is
for
me
to
decide
is
it
not
yes
guess
that
is
so
you
re
like
surgeon
who
wants
every
symptom
before
he
can
give
his
diagnosis
exactly
that
expresses
it
and
it
is
only
patient
who
has
an
object
in
deceiving
his
surgeon
who
would
conceal
the
facts
of
his
case
that
may
be
so
but
you
will
admit
mr
holmes
that
most
men
would
shy
off
bit
when
they
are
asked
point
blank
what
their
relations
with
woman
may
be
if
there
is
really
some
serious
feeling
in
the
case
guess
most
men
have
little
private
reserve
of
their
own
in
some
corner
of
their
souls
where
they
don
welcome
intruders
and
you
burst
suddenly
into
it
but
the
object
excuses
you
since
it
was
to
try
and
save
her
well
the
stakes
are
down
and
the
reserve
open
and
you
can
explore
where
you
will
what
is
it
you
want
the
truth
the
gold
king
paused
for
moment
as
one
who
marshals
his
thoughts
his
grim
deep
lined
face
had
become
even
sadder
and
more
grave
can
give
it
to
you
in
very
few
words
mr
holmes
said
he
at
last
there
are
some
things
that
are
painful
as
well
as
difficult
to
say
so
won
go
deeper
than
is
needful
met
my
wife
when
was
gold
hunting
in
brazil
maria
pinto
was
the
daughter
of
government
official
at
manaos
and
she
was
very
beautiful
was
young
and
ardent
in
those
days
but
even
now
as
look
back
with
colder
blood
and
more
critical
eye
can
see
that
she
was
rare
and
wonderful
in
her
beauty
it
was
deep
rich
nature
too
passionate
whole
hearted
tropical
ill
balanced
very
different
from
the
american
women
whom
had
known
well
to
make
long
story
short
loved
her
and
married
her
it
was
only
when
the
romance
had
passed
and
it
lingered
for
years
that
realized
that
we
had
nothing
absolutely
nothing—
in
common
my
love
faded
if
hers
had
faded
also
it
might
have
been
easier
but
you
know
the
wonderful
way
of
women
do
what
might
nothing
could
turn
her
from
me
if
have
been
harsh
to
her
even
brutal
as
some
have
said
it
has
been
because
knew
that
if
could
kill
her
love
or
if
it
turned
to
hate
it
would
be
easier
for
both
of
us
but
nothing
changed
her
she
adored
me
in
those
english
woods
as
she
had
adored
me
twenty
years
ago
on
the
banks
of
the
amazon
do
what
might
she
was
as
devoted
as
ever
then
came
miss
grace
dunbar
she
answered
our
advertisement
and
became
governess
to
our
two
children
perhaps
you
have
seen
her
portrait
in
the
papers
the
whole
world
has
proclaimed
that
she
also
is
very
beautiful
woman
now
make
no
pretence
to
be
more
moral
than
my
neighbours
and
will
admit
to
you
that
could
not
live
under
the
same
roof
with
such
woman
and
in
daily
contact
with
her
without
feeling
passionate
regard
for
her
do
you
blame
me

do
not
blame
you
for
feeling
it
should
blame
you
if
you
expressed
it
since
this
young
lady
was
in
sense
under
your
protection
well
maybe
so
said
the
millionaire
though
for
moment
the
reproof
had
brought
the
old
angry
gleam
into
his
eyes
not
pretending
to
be
any
better
than
am
guess
all
my
life
ve
been
man
that
reached
out
his
hand
for
what
he
wanted
and
never
wanted
anything
more
than
the
love
and
possession
of
that
woman
told
her
so
oh
you
did
you
holmes
could
look
very
formidable
when
he
was
moved
said
to
her
that
if
could
marry
her
would
but
that
it
was
out
of
my
power
said
that
money
was
no
object
and
that
all
could
do
to
make
her
happy
and
comfortable
would
be
done
very
generous
am
sure
said
holmes
with
sneer
see
here
mr
holmes
came
to
you
on
question
of
evidence
not
on
question
of
morals
not
asking
for
your
criticism
it
is
only
for
the
young
lady
sake
that
touch
your
case
at
all
said
holmes
sternly
don
know
that
anything
she
is
accused
of
is
really
worse
than
what
you
have
yourself
admitted
that
you
have
tried
to
ruin
defenceless
girl
who
was
under
your
roof
some
of
you
rich
men
have
to
be
taught
that
all
the
world
cannot
be
bribed
into
condoning
your
offences
to
my
surprise
the
gold
king
took
the
reproof
with
equanimity
that
how
feel
myself
about
it
now
thank
god
that
my
plans
did
not
work
out
as
intended
she
would
have
none
of
it
and
she
wanted
to
leave
the
house
instantly
why
did
she
not
well
in
the
first
place
others
were
dependent
upon
her
and
it
was
no
light
matter
for
her
to
let
them
all
down
by
sacrificing
her
living
when
had
sworn
as
did
that
she
should
never
be
molested
again
she
consented
to
remain
but
there
was
another
reason
she
knew
the
influence
she
had
over
me
and
that
it
was
stronger
than
any
other
influence
in
the
world
she
wanted
to
use
it
for
good
how
well
she
knew
something
of
my
affairs
they
are
large
mr
holmes—
large
beyond
the
belief
of
an
ordinary
man
can
make
or
break
and
it
is
usually
break
it
wasn
individuals
only
it
was
communities
cities
even
nations
business
is
hard
game
and
the
weak
go
to
the
wall
played
the
game
for
all
it
was
worth
never
squealed
myself
and
never
cared
if
the
other
fellow
squealed
but
she
saw
it
different
guess
she
was
right
she
believed
and
said
that
fortune
for
one
man
that
was
more
than
he
needed
should
not
be
built
on
ten
thousand
ruined
men
who
were
left
without
the
means
of
life
that
was
how
she
saw
it
and
guess
she
could
see
past
the
dollars
to
something
that
was
more
lasting
she
found
that
listened
to
what
she
said
and
she
believed
she
was
serving
the
world
by
influencing
my
actions
so
she
stayed
and
then
this
came
along
can
you
throw
any
light
upon
that
the
gold
king
paused
for
minute
or
more
his
head
sunk
in
his
hands
lost
in
deep
thought
it
very
black
against
her
can
deny
that
and
women
lead
an
inward
life
and
may
do
things
beyond
the
judgment
of
man
at
first
was
so
rattled
and
taken
aback
that
was
ready
to
think
she
had
been
led
away
in
some
extraordinary
fashion
that
was
clean
against
her
usual
nature
one
explanation
came
into
my
head
give
it
to
you
mr
holmes
for
what
it
is
worth
there
is
no
doubt
that
my
wife
was
bitterly
jealous
there
is
soul
jealousy
that
can
be
as
frantic
as
any
body
jealousy
and
though
my
wife
had
no
cause
and
think
she
understood
this
for
the
latter
she
was
aware
that
this
english
girl
exerted
an
influence
upon
my
mind
and
my
acts
that
she
herself
never
had
it
was
an
influence
for
good
but
that
did
not
mend
the
matter
she
was
crazy
with
hatred
and
the
heat
of
the
amazon
was
always
in
her
blood
she
might
have
planned
to
murder
miss
dunbar
or
we
will
say
to
threaten
her
with
gun
and
so
frighten
her
into
leaving
us
then
there
might
have
been
scuffle
and
the
gun
gone
off
and
shot
the
woman
who
held
it
that
possibility
had
already
occurred
to
me
said
holmes
indeed
it
is
the
only
obvious
alternative
to
deliberate
murder
but
she
utterly
denies
it
well
that
is
not
final
is
it
one
can
understand
that
woman
placed
in
so
awful
position
might
hurry
home
still
in
her
bewilderment
holding
the
revolver
she
might
even
throw
it
down
among
her
clothes
hardly
knowing
what
she
was
doing
and
when
it
was
found
she
might
try
to
lie
her
way
out
by
total
denial
since
all
explanation
was
impossible
what
is
against
such
supposition
miss
dunbar
herself
well
perhaps
holmes
looked
at
his
watch
have
no
doubt
we
can
get
the
necessary
permits
this
morning
and
reach
winchester
by
the
evening
train
when
have
seen
this
young
lady
it
is
very
possible
that
may
be
of
more
use
to
you
in
the
matter
though
cannot
promise
that
my
conclusions
will
necessarily
be
such
as
you
desire
there
was
some
delay
in
the
official
pass
and
instead
of
reaching
winchester
that
day
we
went
down
to
thor
place
the
hampshire
estate
of
mr
neil
gibson
he
did
not
accompany
us
himself
but
we
had
the
address
of
sergeant
coventry
of
the
local
police
who
had
first
examined
into
the
affair
he
was
tall
thin
cadaverous
man
with
secretive
and
mysterious
manner
which
conveyed
the
idea
that
he
knew
or
suspected
very
great
deal
more
than
he
dared
say
he
had
trick
too
of
suddenly
sinking
his
voice
to
whisper
as
if
he
had
come
upon
something
of
vital
importance
though
the
information
was
usually
commonplace
enough
behind
these
tricks
of
manner
he
soon
showed
himself
to
be
decent
honest
fellow
who
was
not
too
proud
to
admit
that
he
was
out
of
his
depth
and
would
welcome
any
help
anyhow
rather
have
you
than
scotland
yard
mr
holmes
said
he
if
the
yard
gets
called
into
case
then
the
local
loses
all
credit
for
success
and
may
be
blamed
for
failure
now
you
play
straight
so
ve
heard
need
not
appear
in
the
matter
at
all
said
holmes
to
the
evident
relief
of
our
melancholy
acquaintance
if
can
clear
it
up
don
ask
to
have
my
name
mentioned
well
it
very
handsome
of
you
am
sure
and
your
friend
dr
watson
can
be
trusted
know
now
mr
holmes
as
we
walk
down
to
the
place
there
is
one
question
should
like
to
ask
you
breathe
it
to
no
soul
but
you
he
looked
round
as
though
he
hardly
dare
utter
the
words
don
you
think
there
might
be
case
against
mr
neil
gibson
himself
have
been
considering
that
you
ve
not
seen
miss
dunbar
she
is
wonderful
fine
woman
in
every
way
he
may
well
have
wished
his
wife
out
of
the
road
and
these
americans
are
readier
with
pistols
than
our
folk
are
it
was
his
pistol
you
know
was
that
clearly
made
out
yes
sir
it
was
one
of
pair
that
he
had
one
of
pair
where
is
the
other
well
the
gentleman
has
lot
of
firearms
of
one
sort
and
another
we
never
quite
matched
that
particular
pistol
but
the
box
was
made
for
two
if
it
was
one
of
pair
you
should
surely
be
able
to
match
it
well
we
have
them
all
laid
out
at
the
house
if
you
would
care
to
look
them
over
later
perhaps
think
we
will
walk
down
together
and
have
look
at
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
this
conversation
had
taken
place
in
the
little
front
room
of
sergeant
coventry
humble
cottage
which
served
as
the
local
police
station
walk
of
half
mile
or
so
across
wind
swept
heath
all
gold
and
bronze
with
the
fading
ferns
brought
us
to
side
gate
opening
into
the
grounds
of
the
thor
place
estate
path
led
us
through
the
pheasant
preserves
and
then
from
clearing
we
saw
the
widespread
half
timbered
house
half
tudor
and
half
georgian
upon
the
crest
of
the
hill
beside
us
there
was
long
reedy
pool
constricted
in
the
centre
where
the
main
carriage
drive
passed
over
stone
bridge
but
swelling
into
small
lakes
on
either
side
our
guide
paused
at
the
mouth
of
this
bridge
and
he
pointed
to
the
ground
that
was
where
mrs
gibson
body
lay
marked
it
by
that
stone
understand
that
you
were
there
before
it
was
moved
yes
they
sent
for
me
at
once
who
did
mr
gibson
himself
the
moment
the
alarm
was
given
and
he
had
rushed
down
with
others
from
the
house
he
insisted
that
nothing
should
be
moved
until
the
police
should
arrive
that
was
sensible
gathered
from
the
newspaper
report
that
the
shot
was
fired
from
close
quarters
yes
sir
very
close
near
the
right
temple
just
behind
it
sir
how
did
the
body
lie
on
the
back
sir
no
trace
of
struggle
no
marks
no
weapon
the
short
note
from
miss
dunbar
was
clutched
in
her
left
hand
clutched
you
say
yes
sir
we
could
hardly
open
the
fingers
that
is
of
great
importance
it
excludes
the
idea
that
anyone
could
have
placed
the
note
there
after
death
in
order
to
furnish
false
clue
dear
me
the
note
as
remember
was
quite
short

bridge
at
nine
clock
dunbar
was
that
not
so
yes
sir
did
miss
dunbar
admit
writing
it
yes
sir
what
was
her
explanation
her
defence
was
reserved
for
the
assizes
she
would
say
nothing
the
problem
is
certainly
very
interesting
one
the
point
of
the
letter
is
very
obscure
is
it
not
well
sir
said
the
guide
it
seemed
if
may
be
so
bold
as
to
say
so
the
only
really
clear
point
in
the
whole
case
holmes
shook
his
head
granting
that
the
letter
is
genuine
and
was
really
written
it
was
certainly
received
some
time
before
say
one
hour
or
two
why
then
was
this
lady
still
clasping
it
in
her
left
hand
why
should
she
carry
it
so
carefully
she
did
not
need
to
refer
to
it
in
the
interview
does
it
not
seem
remarkable
well
sir
as
you
put
it
perhaps
it
does
think
should
like
to
sit
quietly
for
few
minutes
and
think
it
out
he
seated
himself
upon
the
stone
ledge
of
the
bridge
and
could
see
his
quick
grey
eyes
darting
their
questioning
glances
in
every
direction
suddenly
he
sprang
up
again
and
ran
across
to
the
opposite
parapet
whipped
his
lens
from
his
pocket
and
began
to
examine
the
stonework
this
is
curious
said
he
yes
sir
we
saw
the
chip
on
the
ledge
expect
it
been
done
by
some
passer
by
the
stonework
was
grey
but
at
this
one
point
it
showed
white
for
space
not
larger
than
sixpence
when
examined
closely
one
could
see
that
the
surface
was
chipped
as
by
sharp
blow
it
took
some
violence
to
do
that
said
holmes
thoughtfully
with
his
cane
he
struck
the
ledge
several
times
without
leaving
mark
yes
it
was
hard
knock
in
curious
place
too
it
was
not
from
above
but
from
below
for
you
see
that
it
is
on
the
lower
edge
of
the
parapet
but
it
is
at
least
fifteen
feet
from
the
body
yes
it
is
fifteen
feet
from
the
body
it
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
but
it
is
point
worth
noting
do
not
think
that
we
have
anything
more
to
learn
here
there
were
no
footsteps
you
say
the
ground
was
iron
hard
sir
there
were
no
traces
at
all
then
we
can
go
we
will
go
up
to
the
house
first
and
look
over
these
weapons
of
which
you
speak
then
we
shall
get
on
to
winchester
for
should
desire
to
see
miss
dunbar
before
we
go
farther
mr
neil
gibson
had
not
returned
from
town
but
we
saw
in
the
house
the
neurotic
mr
bates
who
had
called
upon
us
in
the
morning
he
showed
us
with
sinister
relish
the
formidable
array
of
firearms
of
various
shapes
and
sizes
which
his
employer
had
accumulated
in
the
course
of
an
adventurous
life
mr
gibson
has
his
enemies
as
anyone
would
expect
who
knew
him
and
his
methods
said
he
sleeps
with
loaded
revolver
in
the
drawer
beside
his
bed
he
is
man
of
violence
sir
and
there
are
times
when
all
of
us
are
afraid
of
him
am
sure
that
the
poor
lady
who
has
passed
was
often
terrified
did
you
ever
witness
physical
violence
towards
her
no
cannot
say
that
but
have
heard
words
which
were
nearly
as
bad
words
of
cold
cutting
contempt
even
before
the
servants
our
millionaire
does
not
seem
to
shine
in
private
life
remarked
holmes
as
we
made
our
way
to
the
station
well
watson
we
have
come
on
good
many
facts
some
of
them
new
ones
and
yet
seem
some
way
from
my
conclusion
in
spite
of
the
very
evident
dislike
which
mr
bates
has
to
his
employer
gather
from
him
that
when
the
alarm
came
he
was
undoubtedly
in
his
library
dinner
was
over
at
30
and
all
was
normal
up
to
then
it
is
true
that
the
alarm
was
somewhat
late
in
the
evening
but
the
tragedy
certainly
occurred
about
the
hour
named
in
the
note
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
that
mr
gibson
had
been
out
of
doors
since
his
return
from
town
at
five
clock
on
the
other
hand
miss
dunbar
as
understand
it
admits
that
she
had
made
an
appointment
to
meet
mrs
gibson
at
the
bridge
beyond
this
she
would
say
nothing
as
her
lawyer
had
advised
her
to
reserve
her
defence
we
have
several
very
vital
questions
to
ask
that
young
lady
and
my
mind
will
not
be
easy
until
we
have
seen
her
must
confess
that
the
case
would
seem
to
me
to
be
very
black
against
her
if
it
were
not
for
one
thing
and
what
is
that
holmes
the
finding
of
the
pistol
in
her
wardrobe
dear
me
holmes
cried
that
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
most
damning
incident
of
all
not
so
watson
it
had
struck
me
even
at
my
first
perfunctory
reading
as
very
strange
and
now
that
am
in
closer
touch
with
the
case
it
is
my
only
firm
ground
for
hope
we
must
look
for
consistency
where
there
is
want
of
it
we
must
suspect
deception
hardly
follow
you
well
now
watson
suppose
for
moment
that
we
visualize
you
in
the
character
of
woman
who
in
cold
premeditated
fashion
is
about
to
get
rid
of
rival
you
have
planned
it
note
has
been
written
the
victim
has
come
you
have
your
weapon
the
crime
is
done
it
has
been
workmanlike
and
complete
do
you
tell
me
that
after
carrying
out
so
crafty
crime
you
would
now
ruin
your
reputation
as
criminal
by
forgetting
to
fling
your
weapon
into
those
adjacent
reed
beds
which
would
forever
cover
it
but
you
must
needs
carry
it
carefully
home
and
put
it
in
your
own
wardrobe
the
very
first
place
that
would
be
searched
your
best
friends
would
hardly
call
you
schemer
watson
and
yet
could
not
picture
you
doing
anything
so
crude
as
that
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
no
watson
will
not
admit
that
it
is
possible
where
crime
is
coolly
premeditated
then
the
means
of
covering
it
are
coolly
premeditated
also
hope
therefore
that
we
are
in
the
presence
of
serious
misconception
but
there
is
so
much
to
explain
well
we
shall
set
about
explaining
it
when
once
your
point
of
view
is
changed
the
very
thing
which
was
so
damning
becomes
clue
to
the
truth
for
example
there
is
this
revolver
miss
dunbar
disclaims
all
knowledge
of
it
on
our
new
theory
she
is
speaking
truth
when
she
says
so
therefore
it
was
placed
in
her
wardrobe
who
placed
it
there
someone
who
wished
to
incriminate
her
was
not
that
person
the
actual
criminal
you
see
how
we
come
at
once
upon
most
fruitful
line
of
inquiry
we
were
compelled
to
spend
the
night
at
winchester
as
the
formalities
had
not
yet
been
completed
but
next
morning
in
the
company
of
mr
joyce
cummings
the
rising
barrister
who
was
entrusted
with
the
defence
we
were
allowed
to
see
the
young
lady
in
her
cell
had
expected
from
all
that
we
had
heard
to
see
beautiful
woman
but
can
never
forget
the
effect
which
miss
dunbar
produced
upon
me
it
was
no
wonder
that
even
the
masterful
millionaire
had
found
in
her
something
more
powerful
than
himself
something
which
could
control
and
guide
him
one
felt
too
as
one
looked
at
the
strong
clear
cut
and
yet
sensitive
face
that
even
should
she
be
capable
of
some
impetuous
deed
none
the
less
there
was
an
innate
nobility
of
character
which
would
make
her
influence
always
for
the
good
she
was
brunette
tall
with
noble
figure
and
commanding
presence
but
her
dark
eyes
had
in
them
the
appealing
helpless
expression
of
the
hunted
creature
who
feels
the
nets
around
it
but
can
see
no
way
out
from
the
toils
now
as
she
realized
the
presence
and
the
help
of
my
famous
friend
there
came
touch
of
colour
in
her
wan
cheeks
and
light
of
hope
began
to
glimmer
in
the
glance
which
she
turned
upon
us
perhaps
mr
neil
gibson
has
told
you
something
of
what
occurred
between
us
she
asked
in
low
agitated
voice
yes
holmes
answered
you
need
not
pain
yourself
by
entering
into
that
part
of
the
story
after
seeing
you
am
prepared
to
accept
mr
gibson
statement
both
as
to
the
influence
which
you
had
over
him
and
as
to
the
innocence
of
your
relations
with
him
but
why
was
the
whole
situation
not
brought
out
in
court
it
seemed
to
me
incredible
that
such
charge
could
be
sustained
thought
that
if
we
waited
the
whole
thing
must
clear
itself
up
without
our
being
compelled
to
enter
into
painful
details
of
the
inner
life
of
the
family
but
understand
that
far
from
clearing
it
has
become
even
more
serious
my
dear
young
lady
cried
holmes
earnestly
beg
you
to
have
no
illusions
upon
the
point
mr
cummings
here
would
assure
you
that
all
the
cards
are
at
present
against
us
and
that
we
must
do
everything
that
is
possible
if
we
are
to
win
clear
it
would
be
cruel
deception
to
pretend
that
you
are
not
in
very
great
danger
give
me
all
the
help
you
can
then
to
get
at
the
truth
will
conceal
nothing
tell
us
then
of
your
true
relations
with
mr
gibson
wife
she
hated
me
mr
holmes
she
hated
me
with
all
the
fervour
of
her
tropical
nature
she
was
woman
who
would
do
nothing
by
halves
and
the
measure
of
her
love
for
her
husband
was
the
measure
also
of
her
hatred
for
me
it
is
probable
that
she
misunderstood
our
relations
would
not
wish
to
wrong
her
but
she
loved
so
vividly
in
physical
sense
that
she
could
hardly
understand
the
mental
and
even
spiritual
tie
which
held
her
husband
to
me
or
imagine
that
it
was
only
my
desire
to
influence
his
power
to
good
ends
which
kept
me
under
his
roof
can
see
now
that
was
wrong
nothing
could
justify
me
in
remaining
where
was
cause
of
unhappiness
and
yet
it
is
certain
that
the
unhappiness
would
have
remained
even
if
had
left
the
house

now
miss
dunbar
said
holmes
beg
you
to
tell
us
exactly
what
occurred
that
evening
can
tell
you
the
truth
so
far
as
know
it
mr
holmes
but
am
in
position
to
prove
nothing
and
there
are
points
the
most
vital
points
which
can
neither
explain
nor
can
imagine
any
explanation
if
you
will
find
the
facts
perhaps
others
may
find
the
explanation
with
regard
then
to
my
presence
at
thor
bridge
that
night
received
note
from
mrs
gibson
in
the
morning
it
lay
on
the
table
of
the
schoolroom
and
it
may
have
been
left
there
by
her
own
hand
it
implored
me
to
see
her
there
after
dinner
said
she
had
something
important
to
say
to
me
and
asked
me
to
leave
an
answer
on
the
sundial
in
the
garden
as
she
desired
no
one
to
be
in
our
confidence
saw
no
reason
for
such
secrecy
but
did
as
she
asked
accepting
the
appointment
she
asked
me
to
destroy
her
note
and
burned
it
in
the
schoolroom
grate
she
was
very
much
afraid
of
her
husband
who
treated
her
with
harshness
for
which
frequently
reproached
him
and
could
only
imagine
that
she
acted
in
this
way
because
she
did
not
wish
him
to
know
of
our
interview
yet
she
kept
your
reply
very
carefully
yes
was
surprised
to
hear
that
she
had
it
in
her
hand
when
she
died
well
what
happened
then
went
down
as
had
promised
when
reached
the
bridge
she
was
waiting
for
me
never
did
realize
till
that
moment
how
this
poor
creature
hated
me
she
was
like
mad
woman
indeed
think
she
was
mad
woman
subtly
mad
with
the
deep
power
of
deception
which
insane
people
may
have
how
else
could
she
have
met
me
with
unconcern
every
day
and
yet
had
so
raging
hatred
of
me
in
her
heart
will
not
say
what
she
said
she
poured
her
whole
wild
fury
out
in
burning
and
horrible
words
did
not
even
answer
could
not
it
was
dreadful
to
see
her
put
my
hands
to
my
ears
and
rushed
away
when
left
her
she
was
standing
still
shrieking
out
her
curses
at
me
in
the
mouth
of
the
bridge
where
she
was
afterwards
found
within
few
yards
from
the
spot
and
yet
presuming
that
she
met
her
death
shortly
after
you
left
her
you
heard
no
shot
no
heard
nothing
but
indeed
mr
holmes
was
so
agitated
and
horrified
by
this
terrible
outbreak
that
rushed
to
get
back
to
the
peace
of
my
own
room
and
was
incapable
of
noticing
anything
which
happened
you
say
that
you
returned
to
your
room
did
you
leave
it
again
before
next
morning
yes
when
the
alarm
came
that
the
poor
creature
had
met
her
death
ran
out
with
the
others
did
you
see
mr
gibson
yes
he
had
just
returned
from
the
bridge
when
saw
him
he
had
sent
for
the
doctor
and
the
police
did
he
seem
to
you
much
perturbed
mr
gibson
is
very
strong
self
contained
man
do
not
think
that
he
would
ever
show
his
emotions
on
the
surface
but
who
knew
him
so
well
could
see
that
he
was
deeply
concerned
then
we
come
to
the
all
important
point
this
pistol
that
was
found
in
your
room
had
you
ever
seen
it
before
never
swear
it
when
was
it
found
next
morning
when
the
police
made
their
search
among
your
clothes
yes
on
the
floor
of
my
wardrobe
under
my
dresses
you
could
not
guess
how
long
it
had
been
there
it
had
not
been
there
the
morning
before
how
do
you
know
because
tidied
out
the
wardrobe
that
is
final
then
someone
came
into
your
room
and
placed
the
pistol
there
in
order
to
inculpate
you
it
must
have
been
so
and
when
it
could
only
have
been
at
meal
time
or
else
at
the
hours
when
would
be
in
the
schoolroom
with
the
children
as
you
were
when
you
got
the
note
yes
from
that
time
onward
for
the
whole
morning
thank
you
miss
dunbar
is
there
any
other
point
which
could
help
me
in
the
investigation
can
think
of
none
there
was
some
sign
of
violence
on
the
stonework
of
the
bridge
perfectly
fresh
chip
just
opposite
the
body
could
you
suggest
any
possible
explanation
of
that
surely
it
must
be
mere
coincidence
curious
miss
dunbar
very
curious
why
should
it
appear
at
the
very
time
of
the
tragedy
and
why
at
the
very
place
but
what
could
have
caused
it
only
great
violence
could
have
such
an
effect
holmes
did
not
answer
his
pale
eager
face
had
suddenly
assumed
that
tense
far
away
expression
which
had
learned
to
associate
with
the
supreme
manifestations
of
his
genius
so
evident
was
the
crisis
in
his
mind
that
none
of
us
dared
to
speak
and
we
sat
barrister
prisoner
and
myself
watching
him
in
concentrated
and
absorbed
silence
suddenly
he
sprang
from
his
chair
vibrating
with
nervous
energy
and
the
pressing
need
for
action
come
watson
come
he
cried
what
is
it
mr
holmes
never
mind
my
dear
lady
you
will
hear
from
me
mr
cummings
with
the
help
of
the
god
of
justice
will
give
you
case
which
will
make
england
ring
you
will
get
news
by
to
morrow
miss
dunbar
and
meanwhile
take
my
assurance
that
the
clouds
are
lifting
and
that
have
every
hope
that
the
light
of
truth
is
breaking
through
it
was
not
long
journey
from
winchester
to
thor
place
but
it
was
long
to
me
in
my
impatience
while
for
holmes
it
was
evident
that
it
seemed
endless
for
in
his
nervous
restlessness
he
could
not
sit
still
but
paced
the
carriage
or
drummed
with
his
long
sensitive
fingers
upon
the
cushions
beside
him
suddenly
however
as
we
neared
our
destination
he
seated
himself
opposite
to
me
we
had
first
class
carriage
to
ourselves
and
laying
hand
upon
each
of
my
knees
he
looked
into
my
eyes
with
the
peculiarly
mischievous
gaze
which
was
charactenstic
of
his
more
imp
like
moods
watson
said
he
have
some
recollection
that
you
go
armed
upon
these
excursions
of
ours
it
was
as
well
for
him
that
did
so
for
he
took
little
care
for
his
own
safety
when
his
mind
was
once
absorbed
by
problem
so
that
more
than
once
my
revolver
had
been
good
friend
in
need
reminded
him
of
the
fact
yes
am
little
absent
minded
in
such
matters
but
have
you
your
revolver
on
you
produced
it
from
my
hip
pocket
short
handy
but
very
serviceable
little
weapon
he
undid
the
catch
shook
out
the
cartridges
and
examined
it
with
care
it
heavy
remarkably
heavy
said
he
yes
it
is
solid
bit
of
work
he
mused
over
it
for
minute
do
you
know
watson
said
he
believe
your
revolver
is
going
to
have
very
intimate
connection
with
the
mystery
which
we
are
investigating
my
dear
holmes
you
are
joking
no
watson
am
very
serious
there
is
test
before
us
if
the
test
comes
off
all
will
be
clear
and
the
test
will
depend
upon
the
conduct
of
this
little
weapon
one
cartridge
out
now
we
will
replace
the
other
five
and
put
on
the
safety
catch
so
that
increases
the
weight
and
makes
it
better
reproduction
had
no
glimmer
of
what
was
in
his
mind
nor
did
he
enlighten
me
but
sat
lost
in
thought
until
we
pulled
up
in
the
little
hampshire
station
we
secured
ramshackle
trap
and
in
quarter
of
an
hour
were
at
the
house
of
our
confidential
friend
the
sergeant
clue
mr
holmes
what
is
it
all
depends
upon
the
behaviour
of
dr
watson
revolver
said
my
friend
here
it
is
now
officer
can
you
give
me
ten
yards
of
string
the
village
shop
provided
ball
of
stout
twine
think
that
this
is
all
we
will
need
said
holmes
now
if
you
please
we
will
get
off
on
what
hope
is
the
last
stage
of
our
journey
the
sun
was
setting
and
turning
the
rolling
hampshire
moor
into
wonderful
autumnal
panorama
the
sergeant
with
many
critical
and
incredulous
glances
which
showed
his
deep
doubts
of
the
sanity
of
my
companion
lurched
along
beside
us
as
we
approached
the
scene
of
the
crime
could
see
that
my
friend
under
all
his
habitual
coolness
was
in
truth
deeply
agitated
yes
he
said
in
answer
to
my
remark
you
have
seen
me
miss
my
mark
before
watson
have
an
instinct
for
such
things
and
yet
it
has
sometimes
played
me
false
it
seemed
certainty
when
first
it
flashed
across
my
mind
in
the
cell
at
winchester
but
one
drawback
of
an
active
mind
is
that
one
can
always
conceive
alternative
explanations
which
would
make
our
scent
false
one
and
yet
and
yet
well
watson
we
can
but
try
as
he
walked
he
had
firmly
tied
one
end
of
the
string
to
the
handle
of
the
revolver
we
had
now
reached
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
with
great
care
he
marked
out
under
the
guidance
of
the
policeman
the
exact
spot
where
the
body
had
been
stretched
he
then
hunted
among
the
heather
and
the
ferns
until
he
found
considerable
stone
this
he
secured
to
the
other
end
of
his
line
of
string
and
he
hung
it
over
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
so
that
it
swung
clear
above
the
water
he
then
stood
on
the
fatal
spot
some
distance
from
the
edge
of
the
bridge
with
my
revolver
in
his
hand
the
string
being
taut
between
the
weapon
and
the
heavy
stone
on
the
farther
side

now
for
it
he
cried
at
the
words
he
raised
the
pistol
to
his
head
and
then
let
go
his
grip
in
an
instant
it
had
been
whisked
away
by
the
weight
of
the
stone
had
struck
with
sharp
crack
against
the
parapet
and
had
vanished
over
the
side
into
the
water
it
had
hardly
gone
before
holmes
was
kneeling
beside
the
stonework
and
joyous
cry
showed
that
he
had
found
what
he
expected
was
there
ever
more
exact
demonstration
he
cried
see
watson
your
revolver
has
solved
the
problem
as
he
spoke
he
pointed
to
second
chip
of
the
exact
size
and
shape
of
the
first
which
had
appeared
on
the
under
edge
of
the
stone
balustrade
we
ll
stay
at
the
inn
to
night
he
continued
as
he
rose
and
faced
the
astonished
sergeant
you
will
of
course
get
grappling
hook
and
you
will
easily
restore
my
friend
revolver
you
will
also
find
beside
it
the
revolver
string
and
weight
with
which
this
vindictive
woman
attempted
to
disguise
her
own
crime
and
to
fasten
charge
of
murder
upon
an
innocent
victim
you
can
let
mr
gibson
know
that
will
see
him
in
the
morning
when
steps
can
be
taken
for
miss
dunbar
vindication
late
that
evening
as
we
sat
together
smoking
our
pipes
in
the
village
inn
holmes
gave
me
brief
review
of
what
had
passed
fear
watson
said
he
that
you
will
not
improve
any
reputation
which
may
have
acquired
by
adding
the
case
of
the
thor
bridge
mystery
to
your
annals
have
been
sluggish
in
mind
and
wanting
in
that
mixture
of
imagination
and
reality
which
is
the
basis
of
my
art
confess
that
the
chip
in
the
stonework
was
sufficient
clue
to
suggest
the
true
solution
and
that
blame
myself
for
not
having
attained
it
sooner
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
workings
of
this
unhappy
woman
mind
were
deep
and
subtle
so
that
it
was
no
very
simple
matter
to
unravel
her
plot
do
not
think
that
in
our
adventures
we
have
ever
come
across
stranger
example
of
what
perverted
love
can
bring
about
whether
miss
dunbar
was
her
rival
in
physical
or
in
merely
mental
sense
seems
to
have
been
equally
unforgivable
in
her
eyes
no
doubt
she
blamed
this
innocent
lady
for
all
those
harsh
dealings
and
unkind
words
with
which
her
husband
tried
to
repel
her
too
demonstrative
affection
her
first
resolution
was
to
end
her
own
life
her
second
was
to
do
it
in
such
way
as
to
involve
her
victim
in
fate
which
was
worse
far
than
any
sudden
death
could
be
we
can
follow
the
various
steps
quite
clearly
and
they
show
remarkable
subtlety
of
mind
note
was
extracted
very
cleverly
from
miss
dunbar
which
would
make
it
appear
that
she
had
chosen
the
scene
of
the
crime
in
her
anxiety
that
it
should
be
discovered
she
somewhat
overdid
it
by
holding
it
in
her
hand
to
the
last
this
alone
should
have
excited
my
suspicions
earlier
than
it
did
then
she
took
one
of
her
husband
revolvers
there
was
as
you
saw
an
arsenal
in
the
house
and
kept
it
for
her
own
use
similar
one
she
concealed
that
morning
in
miss
dunbar
wardrobe
after
discharging
one
barrel
which
she
could
easily
do
in
the
woods
without
attracting
attention
she
then
went
down
to
the
bridge
where
she
had
contrived
this
exceedingly
ingenious
method
for
getting
rid
of
her
weapon
when
miss
dunbar
appeared
she
used
her
last
breath
in
pouring
out
her
hatred
and
then
when
she
was
out
of
hearing
carried
out
her
terrible
purpose
every
link
is
now
in
its
place
and
the
chain
is
complete
the
papers
may
ask
why
the
mere
was
not
dragged
in
the
first
instance
but
it
is
easy
to
be
wise
after
the
event
and
in
any
case
the
expanse
of
reed
filled
lake
is
no
easy
matter
to
drag
unless
you
have
clear
perception
of
what
you
are
looking
for
and
where
well
watson
we
have
helped
remarkable
woman
and
also
formidable
man
should
they
in
the
future
join
their
forces
as
seems
not
unlikely
the
financial
world
may
find
that
mr
neil
gibson
has
learned
something
in
that
schoolroom
of
sorrow
where
our
earthly
lessons
are
taught
iii
the
adventure
of
the
creeping
man
mr
sherlock
holmes
was
always
of
opinion
that
should
publish
the
singular
facts
connected
with
professor
presbury
if
only
to
dispel
once
for
all
the
ugly
rumours
which
some
twenty
years
ago
agitated
the
university
and
were
echoed
in
the
learned
societies
of
london
there
were
however
certain
obstacles
in
the
way
and
the
true
history
of
this
curious
case
remained
entombed
in
the
tin
box
which
contains
so
many
records
of
my
friend
adventures
now
we
have
at
last
obtained
permission
to
ventilate
the
facts
which
formed
one
of
the
very
last
cases
handled
by
holmes
before
his
retirement
from
practice
even
now
certain
reticence
and
discretion
have
to
be
observed
in
laying
the
matter
before
the
public
it
was
one
sunday
evening
early
in
september
of
the
year
1903
that
received
one
of
holmes
laconic
messages
come
at
once
if
convenient
if
inconvenient
come
all
the
same
the
relations
between
us
in
those
latter
days
were
peculiar
he
was
man
of
habits
narrow
and
concentrated
habits
and
had
become
one
of
them
as
an
institution
was
like
the
violin
the
shag
tobacco
the
old
black
pipe
the
index
books
and
others
perhaps
less
excusable
when
it
was
case
of
active
work
and
comrade
was
needed
upon
whose
nerve
he
could
place
some
reliance
my
role
was
obvious
but
apart
from
this
had
uses
was
whetstone
for
his
mind
stimulated
him
he
liked
to
think
aloud
in
my
presence
his
remarks
could
hardly
be
said
to
be
made
to
me
many
of
them
would
have
been
as
appropriately
addressed
to
his
bedstead
but
none
the
less
having
formed
the
habit
it
had
become
in
some
way
helpful
that
should
register
and
interject
if
irritated
him
by
certain
methodical
slowness
in
my
mentality
that
irritation
served
only
to
make
his
own
flame
like
intuitions
and
impressions
flash
up
the
more
vividly
and
swiftly
such
was
my
humble
role
in
our
alliance
when
arrived
at
baker
street
found
him
huddled
up
in
his
armchair
with
updrawn
knees
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
his
brow
furrowed
with
thought
it
was
clear
that
he
was
in
the
throes
of
some
vexatious
problem
with
wave
of
his
hand
he
indicated
my
old
armchair
but
otherwise
for
half
an
hour
he
gave
no
sign
that
he
was
aware
of
my
presence
then
with
start
he
seemed
to
come
from
his
reverie
and
with
his
usual
whimsical
smile
he
greeted
me
back
to
what
had
once
been
my
home
you
will
excuse
certain
abstraction
of
mind
my
dear
watson
said
he
some
curious
facts
have
been
submitted
to
me
within
the
last
twenty
four
hours
and
they
in
turn
have
given
rise
to
some
speculations
of
more
general
character
have
serious
thoughts
of
writing
small
monograph
upon
the
uses
of
dogs
in
the
work
of
the
detective
but
surely
holmes
this
has
been
explored
said
bloodhounds—
sleuth
hounds—
no
watson
that
side
of
the
matter
is
of
course
obvious
but
there
is
another
which
is
far
more
subtle
you
may
recollect
that
in
the
case
which
you
in
your
sensational
way
coupled
with
the
copper
beeches
was
able
by
watching
the
mind
of
the
child
to
form
deduction
as
to
the
criminal
habits
of
the
very
smug
and
respectable
father
yes
remember
it
well
my
line
of
thoughts
about
dogs
is
analogous
dog
reflects
the
family
life
whoever
saw
frisky
dog
in
gloomy
family
or
sad
dog
in
happy
one
snarling
people
have
snarling
dogs
dangerous
people
have
dangerous
ones
and
their
passing
moods
may
reflect
the
passing
moods
of
others
shook
my
head
surely
holmes
this
is
little
far
fetched
said
he
had
refilled
his
pipe
and
resumed
his
seat
taking
no
notice
of
my
comment
the
practical
application
of
what
have
said
is
very
close
to
the
problem
which
am
investigating
it
is
tangled
skein
you
understand
and
am
looking
for
loose
end
one
possible
loose
end
lies
in
the
question
why
does
professor
presbury
wolfhound
roy
endeavour
to
bite
him
sank
back
in
my
chair
in
some
disappointment
was
it
for
so
trivial
question
as
this
that
had
been
summoned
from
my
work
holmes
glanced
across
at
me
the
same
old
watson
said
he
you
never
learn
that
the
gravest
issues
may
depend
upon
the
smallest
things
but
is
it
not
on
the
face
of
it
strange
that
staid
elderly
philosopher
you
ve
heard
of
presbury
of
course
the
famous
camford
physiologist
that
such
man
whose
friend
has
been
his
devoted
wolfhound
should
now
have
been
twice
attacked
by
his
own
dog
what
do
you
make
of
it
the
dog
is
ill
well
that
has
to
be
considered
but
he
attacks
no
one
else
nor
does
he
apparently
molest
his
master
save
on
very
special
occasions
curious
watson
very
curious
but
young
mr
bennett
is
before
his
time
if
that
is
his
ring
had
hoped
to
have
longer
chat
with
you
before
he
came
there
was
quick
step
on
the
stairs
sharp
tap
at
the
door
and
moment
later
the
new
client
presented
himself
he
was
tall
handsome
youth
about
thirty
well
dressed
and
elegant
but
with
something
in
his
bearing
which
suggested
the
shyness
of
the
student
rather
than
the
self
possession
of
the
man
of
the
world
he
shook
hands
with
holmes
and
then
looked
with
some
surprise
at
me

this
matter
is
very
delicate
mr
holmes
he
said
consider
the
relation
in
which
stand
to
professor
presbury
both
privately
and
publicly
really
can
hardly
justify
myself
if
speak
before
any
third
person
have
no
fear
mr
bennett
dr
watson
is
the
very
soul
of
discretion
and
can
assure
you
that
this
is
matter
in
which
am
very
likely
to
need
an
assistant
as
you
like
mr
holmes
you
will
am
sure
understand
my
having
some
reserves
in
the
matter
you
will
appreciate
it
watson
when
tell
you
that
this
gentleman
mr
trevor
bennett
is
professional
assistant
to
the
great
scientist
lives
under
his
roof
and
is
engaged
to
his
only
daughter
certainly
we
must
agree
that
the
professor
has
every
claim
upon
his
loyalty
and
devotion
but
it
may
best
be
shown
by
taking
the
necessary
steps
to
clear
up
this
strange
mystery
hope
so
mr
holmes
that
is
my
one
object
does
dr
watson
know
the
situation
have
not
had
time
to
explain
it
then
perhaps
had
better
go
over
the
ground
again
before
explaining
some
fresh
developments
will
do
so
myself
said
holmes
in
order
to
show
that
have
the
events
in
their
due
order
the
professor
watson
is
man
of
european
reputation
his
life
has
been
academic
there
has
never
been
breath
of
scandal
he
is
widower
with
one
daughter
edith
he
is
gather
man
of
very
virile
and
positive
one
might
almost
say
combative
character
so
the
matter
stood
until
very
few
months
ago
then
the
current
of
his
life
was
broken
he
is
sixty
one
years
of
age
but
he
became
engaged
to
the
daughter
of
professor
morphy
his
colleague
in
the
chair
of
comparative
anatomy
it
was
not
as
understand
the
reasoned
courting
of
an
elderly
man
but
rather
the
passionate
frenzy
of
youth
for
no
one
could
have
shown
himself
more
devoted
lover
the
lady
alice
morphy
was
very
perfect
girl
both
in
mind
and
body
so
that
there
was
every
excuse
for
the
professor
infatuation
none
the
less
it
did
not
meet
with
full
approval
in
his
own
family
we
thought
it
rather
excessive
said
our
visitor
exactly
excessive
and
little
violent
and
unnatural
professor
presbury
was
rich
however
and
there
was
no
objection
upon
the
part
of
the
father
the
daughter
however
had
other
views
and
there
were
already
several
candidates
for
her
hand
who
if
they
were
less
eligible
from
worldly
point
of
view
were
at
least
more
of
an
age
the
girl
seemed
to
like
the
professor
in
spite
of
his
eccentricities
it
was
only
age
which
stood
in
the
way
about
this
time
little
mystery
suddenly
clouded
the
normal
routine
of
the
professor
life
he
did
what
he
had
never
done
before
he
left
home
and
gave
no
indication
where
he
was
going
he
was
away
fortnight
and
returned
looking
rather
travel
worn
he
made
no
allusion
to
where
he
had
been
although
he
was
usually
the
frankest
of
men
it
chanced
however
that
our
client
here
mr
bennett
received
letter
from
fellowstudent
in
prague
who
said
that
he
was
glad
to
have
seen
professor
presbury
there
although
he
had
not
been
able
to
talk
to
him
only
in
this
way
did
his
own
household
learn
where
he
had
been
now
comes
the
point
from
that
time
onward
curious
change
came
over
the
professor
he
became
furtive
and
sly
those
around
him
had
always
the
feeling
that
he
was
not
the
man
that
they
had
known
but
that
he
was
under
some
shadow
which
had
darkened
his
higher
qualities
his
intellect
was
not
affected
his
lectures
were
as
brilliant
as
ever
but
always
there
was
something
new
something
sinister
and
unexpected
his
daughter
who
was
devoted
to
him
tried
again
and
again
to
resume
the
old
relations
and
to
penetrate
this
mask
which
her
father
seemed
to
have
put
on
you
sir
as
understand
did
the
same
but
all
was
in
vain
and
now
mr
bennett
tell
in
your
own
words
the
incident
of
the
letters
you
must
understand
dr
watson
that
the
professor
had
no
secrets
from
me
if
were
his
son
or
his
younger
brother
could
not
have
more
completely
enjoyed
his
confidence
as
his
secretary
handled
every
paper
which
came
to
him
and
opened
and
subdivided
his
letters
shortly
after
his
return
all
this
was
changed
he
told
me
that
certain
letters
might
come
to
him
from
london
which
would
be
marked
by
cross
under
the
stamp
these
were
to
be
set
aside
for
his
own
eyes
only
may
say
that
several
of
these
did
pass
through
my
hands
that
they
had
the
mark
and
were
in
an
illiterate
handwriting
if
he
answered
them
at
all
the
answers
did
not
pass
through
my
hands
nor
into
the
letterbasket
in
which
our
correspondence
was
collected
and
the
box
said
holmes
ah
yes
the
box
the
professor
brought
back
little
wooden
box
from
his
travels
it
was
the
one
thing
which
suggested
continental
tour
for
it
was
one
of
those
quaint
carved
things
which
one
associates
with
germany
this
he
placed
in
his
instrument
cupboard
one
day
in
looking
for
canula
took
up
the
box
to
my
surprise
he
was
very
angry
and
reproved
me
in
words
which
were
quite
savage
for
my
curiosity
it
was
the
first
time
such
thing
had
happened
and
was
deeply
hurt
endeavoured
to
explain
that
it
was
mere
accident
that
had
touched
the
box
but
all
the
evening
was
conscious
that
he
looked
at
me
harshly
and
that
the
incident
was
rankling
in
his
mind
mr
bennett
drew
little
diary
book
from
his
pocket
that
was
on
july
2d
said
he
you
are
certainly
an
admirable
witness
said
holmes
may
need
some
of
these
dates
which
you
have
noted
learned
method
among
other
things
from
my
great
teacher
from
the
time
that
observed
abnormality
in
his
behaviour
felt
that
it
was
my
duty
to
study
his
case
thus
have
it
here
that
it
was
on
that
very
day
july
2d
that
roy
attacked
the
professor
as
he
came
from
his
study
into
the
hall
again
on
july
11th
there
was
scene
of
the
same
sort
and
then
have
note
of
yet
another
upon
july
20th
after
that
we
had
to
banish
roy
to
the
stables
he
was
dear
affectionate
animal
but
fear
weary
you
mr
bennett
spoke
in
tone
of
reproach
for
it
was
very
clear
that
holmes
was
not
listening
his
face
was
rigid
and
his
eyes
gazed
abstractedly
at
the
ceiling
with
an
effort
he
recovered
himself
singular
most
singular
he
murmured
these
details
were
new
to
me
mr
bennett
think
we
have
now
fairly
gone
over
the
old
ground
have
we
not
but
you
spoke
of
some
fresh
developments
the
pleasant
open
face
of
our
visitor
clouded
over
shadowed
by
some
grim
remembrance
what
speak
of
occurred
the
night
before
last
said
he
was
lying
awake
about
two
in
the
morning
when
was
aware
of
dull
muffled
sound
coming
from
the
passage
opened
my
door
and
peeped
out
should
explain
that
the
professor
sleeps
at
the
end
of
the
passage—
the
date
being
asked
holmes
our
visitor
was
clearly
annoyed
at
so
irrelevant
an
interruption
have
said
sir
that
it
was
the
night
before
last
that
is
september
4th
holmes
nodded
and
smiled
pray
continue
said
he
sleeps
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
would
have
to
pass
my
door
in
order
to
reach
the
staircase
it
was
really
terrifying
experience
mr
holmes
think
that
am
as
strong
nerved
as
my
neighbours
but
was
shaken
by
what
saw
the
passage
was
dark
save
that
one
window
halfway
along
it
threw
patch
of
light
could
see
that
something
was
coming
along
the
passage
something
dark
and
crouching
then
suddenly
it
emerged
into
the
light
and
saw
that
it
was
he
was
crawling
mr
holmes
crawling
he
was
not
quite
on
his
hands
and
knees
should
rather
say
on
his
hands
and
feet
with
his
face
sunk
between
his
hands
yet
he
seemed
to
move
with
ease
was
so
paralyzed
by
the
sight
that
it
was
not
until
he
had
reached
my
door
that
was
able
to
step
forward
and
ask
if
could
assist
him
his
answer
was
extraordinary
he
sprang
up
spat
out
some
atrocious
word
at
me
and
hurried
on
past
me
and
down
the
staircase
waited
about
for
an
hour
but
he
did
not
come
back
it
must
have
been
daylight
before
he
regained
his
room
well
watson
what
make
you
of
that
asked
holmes
with
the
air
of
the
pathologist
who
presents
rare
specimen
lumbago
possibly
have
known
severe
attack
make
man
walk
in
just
such
way
and
nothing
would
be
more
trying
to
the
temper
good
watson
you
always
keep
us
flat
footed
on
the
ground
but
we
can
hardly
accept
lumbago
since
he
was
able
to
stand
erect
in
moment
he
was
never
better
in
health
said
bennett
in
fact
he
is
stronger
than
have
known
him
for
years
but
there
are
the
facts
mr
holmes
it
is
not
case
in
which
we
can
consult
the
police
and
yet
we
are
utterly
at
our
wit
end
as
to
what
to
do
and
we
feel
in
some
strange
way
that
we
are
drifting
towards
disaster
edith
miss
presbury—
feels
as
do
that
we
cannot
wait
passively
any
longer
it
is
certainly
very
curious
and
suggestive
case
what
do
you
think

speaking
as
medical
man
said
it
appears
to
be
case
for
an
alienist
the
old
gentleman
cerebral
processes
were
disturbed
by
the
love
affair
he
made
journey
abroad
in
the
hope
of
breaking
himself
of
the
passion
his
letters
and
the
box
may
be
connected
with
some
other
private
transaction
loan
perhaps
or
share
cenificates
which
are
in
the
box
and
the
wolfhound
no
doubt
disapproved
of
the
financial
bargain
no
watson
there
is
more
in
it
than
this
now
can
only
suggest—
what
sherlock
holmes
was
about
to
suggest
will
never
be
known
for
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
young
lady
was
shown
into
the
room
as
she
appeared
mr
bennett
sprang
up
with
cry
and
ran
forward
with
his
hands
out
to
meet
those
which
she
had
herself
outstretched
edith
dear
nothing
the
matter
hope
felt
must
follow
you
oh
jack
have
been
so
dreadfully
frightened
it
is
awful
to
be
there
alone
mr
holmes
this
is
the
young
lady
spoke
of
this
is
my
fiancee
we
were
gradually
coming
to
that
conclusion
were
we
not
watson
holmes
answered
with
smile
take
it
miss
presbury
that
there
is
some
fresh
development
in
the
case
and
that
you
thought
we
should
know
our
new
visitor
bright
handsome
girl
of
conventional
english
type
smiled
back
at
holmes
as
she
seated
herself
beside
mr
bennett
when
found
mr
bennett
had
left
his
hotel
thought
should
probably
find
him
here
of
course
he
had
told
me
that
he
would
consult
you
but
oh
mr
holmes
can
you
do
nothing
for
my
poor
father
have
hopes
miss
presbury
but
the
case
is
still
obscure
perhaps
what
you
have
to
say
may
throw
some
fresh
light
upon
it
was
last
night
mr
holmes
he
had
been
very
strange
all
day
am
sure
that
there
are
times
when
he
has
no
recollection
of
what
he
does
he
lives
as
in
strange
dream
yesterday
was
such
day
it
was
not
my
father
with
whom
lived
his
outward
shell
was
there
but
it
was
not
really
he
tell
me
what
happened
was
awakened
in
the
night
by
the
dog
barking
most
furiously
poor
roy
he
is
chained
now
near
the
stable
may
say
that
always
sleep
with
my
door
locked
for
as
jack
as
mr
bennett
will
tell
you
we
all
have
feeling
of
impending
danger
my
room
is
on
the
second
floor
it
happened
that
the
blind
was
up
in
my
window
and
there
was
bright
moonlight
outside
as
lay
with
my
eyes
fixed
upon
the
square
of
light
listening
to
the
frenzied
barkings
of
the
dog
was
amazed
to
see
my
father
face
looking
in
at
me
mr
holmes
nearly
died
of
surprise
and
horror
there
it
was
pressed
against
the
windowpane
and
one
hand
seemed
to
be
raised
as
if
to
push
up
the
window
if
that
window
had
opened
think
should
have
gone
mad
it
was
no
delusion
mr
holmes
don
deceive
yourself
by
thinking
so
dare
say
it
was
twenty
seconds
or
so
that
lay
paralyzed
and
watched
the
face
then
it
vanished
but
could
not
could
not
spring
out
of
bed
and
look
out
after
it
lay
cold
and
shivering
till
morning
at
breakfast
he
was
sharp
and
fierce
in
manner
and
made
no
allusion
to
the
adventure
of
the
night
neither
did
but
gave
an
excuse
for
coming
to
town—
and
here
am
holmes
looked
thoroughly
surprised
at
miss
presbury
narrative
my
dear
young
lady
you
say
that
your
room
is
on
the
second
floor
is
there
long
ladder
in
the
garden
no
mr
holmes
that
is
the
amazing
part
of
it
there
is
no
possible
way
of
reaching
the
window
and
yet
he
was
there
the
date
being
september
5th
said
holmes
that
certainly
complicates
matters
it
was
the
young
lady
turn
to
look
surprised
this
is
the
second
time
that
you
have
alluded
to
the
date
mr
holmes
said
bennett
is
it
possible
that
it
has
any
bearing
upon
the
case
it
is
possible
very
possible
and
yet
have
not
my
full
material
at
present
possibly
you
are
thinking
of
the
connection
between
insanity
and
phases
of
the
moon
no
assure
you
it
was
quite
different
line
of
thought
possibly
you
can
leave
your
notebook
with
me
and
will
check
the
dates
now
think
watson
that
our
line
of
action
is
perfectly
clear
this
young
lady
has
informed
us
and
have
the
greatest
confidence
in
her
intuition
that
her
father
remembers
little
or
nothing
which
occurs
upon
certain
dates
we
will
therefore
call
upon
him
as
if
he
had
given
us
an
appointment
upon
such
date
he
will
put
it
down
to
his
own
lack
of
memory
thus
we
will
open
our
campaign
by
having
good
close
view
of
him
that
is
excellent
said
mr
bennett
warn
you
however
that
the
professor
is
irascible
and
violent
at
times
holmes
smiled
there
are
reasons
why
we
should
come
at
once
very
cogent
reasons
if
my
theories
hold
good
to
morrow
mr
bennett
will
certainly
see
us
in
camford
there
is
if
remember
right
an
inn
called
the
chequers
where
the
port
used
to
be
above
mediocrity
and
the
linen
was
above
reproach
think
watson
that
our
lot
for
the
next
few
days
might
lie
in
less
pleasant
places
monday
morning
found
us
on
our
way
to
the
famous
university
town
an
easy
effort
on
the
part
of
holmes
who
had
no
roots
to
pull
up
but
one
which
involved
frantic
planning
and
hurrying
on
my
part
as
my
practice
was
by
this
time
not
inconsiderable
holmes
made
no
allusion
to
the
case
until
after
we
had
deposited
our
suitcases
at
the
ancient
hostel
of
which
he
had
spoken
think
watson
that
we
can
catch
the
professor
just
before
lunch
he
lectures
at
eleven
and
should
have
an
interval
at
home
what
possible
excuse
have
we
for
calling
holmes
glanced
at
his
notebook
there
was
period
of
excitement
upon
august
26th
we
will
assume
that
he
is
little
hazy
as
to
what
he
does
at
such
times
if
we
insist
that
we
are
there
by
appointment
think
he
will
hardly
venture
to
contradict
us
have
you
the
effrontery
necessary
to
put
it
through
we
can
but
try
excellent
watson
compound
of
the
busy
bee
and
excelsior
we
can
but
try
the
motto
of
the
firm
friendly
native
will
surely
guide
us
such
one
on
the
back
of
smart
hansom
swept
us
past
row
of
ancient
colleges
and
finally
turning
into
tree
lined
drive
pulled
up
at
the
door
of
charming
house
girt
round
with
lawns
and
covered
with
purple
wistaria
professor
presbury
was
certainly
surrounded
with
every
sign
not
only
of
comfort
but
of
luxury
even
as
we
pulled
up
grizzled
head
appeared
at
the
front
window
and
we
were
aware
of
pair
of
keen
eyes
from
under
shaggy
brows
which
surveyed
us
through
large
horn
glasses
moment
later
we
were
actually
in
his
sanctum
and
the
mysterious
scientist
whose
vagaries
had
brought
us
from
london
was
standing
before
us
there
was
certainly
no
sign
of
eccentricity
either
in
his
manner
or
appearance
for
he
was
portly
largefeatured
man
grave
tall
and
frock
coated
with
the
dignity
of
bearing
which
lecturer
needs
his
eyes
were
his
most
remarkable
feature
keen
observant
and
clever
to
the
verge
of
cunning
he
looked
at
our
cards
pray
sit
down
gentlemen
what
can
do
for
you
mr
holmes
smiled
amiably
it
was
the
question
which
was
about
to
put
to
you
professor
to
me
sir
possibly
there
is
some
mistake
heard
through
second
person
that
professor
presbury
of
camford
had
need
of
my
services
oh
indeed
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
malicious
sparkle
in
the
intense
grey
eyes
you
heard
that
did
you
may
ask
the
name
of
your
informant
am
sorry
professor
but
the
matter
was
rather
confidential
if
have
made
mistake
there
is
no
harm
done
can
only
express
my
regret
not
at
all
should
wish
to
go
further
into
this
matter
it
interests
me
have
you
any
scrap
of
writing
any
letter
or
telegram
to
bear
out
your
assertion
no
have
not
presume
that
you
do
not
go
so
far
as
to
assert
that
summoned
you
would
rather
answer
no
questions
said
holmes
no
dare
say
not
said
the
professor
with
asperity
however
that
particular
one
can
be
answered
very
easily
without
your
aid
he
walked
across
the
room
to
the
bell
our
london
friend
mr
bennett
answered
the
call
come
in
mr
bennett
these
two
gentlemen
have
come
from
london
under
the
impression
that
they
have
been
summoned
you
handle
all
my
correspondence
have
you
note
of
anything
going
to
person
named
holmes
no
sir
bennett
answered
with
flush
that
is
conclusive
said
the
professor
glaring
angrily
at
my
companion
now
sir
he
leaned
forward
with
his
two
hands
upon
the
table—
it
seems
to
me
that
your
position
is
very
questionable
one
holmes
shrugged
his
shoulders
can
only
repeat
that
am
sorry
that
we
have
made
needless
intrusion
hardly
enough
mr
holmes
the
old
man
cried
in
high
screaming
voice
with
extraordinary
malignancy
upon
his
face
he
got
between
us
and
the
door
as
he
spoke
and
he
shook
his
two
hands
at
us
with
furious
passion
you
can
hardly
get
out
of
it
so
easily
as
that
his
face
was
convulsed
and
he
grinned
and
gibbered
at
us
in
his
senseless
rage
am
convinced
that
we
should
have
had
to
fight
our
way
out
of
the
room
if
mr
bennett
had
not
intervened

my
dear
professor
he
cried
consider
your
position
consider
the
scandal
at
the
university
mr
holmes
is
wellknown
man
you
cannot
possibly
treat
him
with
such
discourtesy
sulkily
our
host
if
may
call
him
so
cleared
the
path
to
the
door
we
were
glad
to
find
ourselves
outside
the
house
and
in
the
quiet
of
the
tree
lined
drive
holmes
seemed
greatly
amused
by
the
episode
our
learned
friend
nerves
are
somewhat
out
of
order
said
he
perhaps
our
intrusion
was
little
crude
and
yet
we
have
gained
that
personal
contact
which
desired
but
dear
me
watson
he
is
surely
at
our
heels
the
villain
still
pursues
us
there
were
the
sounds
of
running
feet
behind
but
it
was
to
my
relief
not
the
formidable
professor
but
his
assistant
who
appeared
round
the
curve
of
the
drive
he
came
panting
up
to
us
am
so
sorry
mr
holmes
wished
to
apologize
my
dear
sir
there
is
no
need
it
is
all
in
the
way
of
professional
experience
have
never
seen
him
in
more
dangerous
mood
but
he
grows
more
sinister
you
can
understand
now
why
his
daughter
and
are
alarmed
and
yet
his
mind
is
perfectly
clear
too
clear
said
holmes
that
was
my
miscalculation
it
is
evident
that
his
memory
is
much
more
reliable
than
had
thought
by
the
way
can
we
before
we
go
see
the
window
of
miss
presbury
room
mr
bennett
pushed
his
way
through
some
shrubs
and
we
had
view
of
the
side
of
the
house
it
is
there
the
second
on
the
left
dear
me
it
seems
hardly
accessible
and
yet
you
will
observe
that
there
is
creeper
below
and
water
pipe
above
which
give
some
foothold
could
not
climb
it
myself
said
mr
bennett
very
likely
it
would
certainly
be
dangerous
exploit
for
any
normal
man
there
was
one
other
thing
wish
to
tell
you
mr
holmes
have
the
address
of
the
man
in
london
to
whom
the
professor
writes
he
seems
to
have
written
this
morning
and
got
it
from
his
blotting
paper
it
is
an
ignoble
position
for
trusted
secretary
but
what
else
can
do
holmes
glanced
at
the
paper
and
put
it
into
his
pocket
dorak
curious
name
slavonic
imagine
well
it
is
an
important
link
in
the
chain
we
return
to
london
this
afternoon
mr
bennett
see
no
good
purpose
to
be
served
by
our
remaining
we
cannot
arrest
the
professor
because
he
has
done
no
crime
nor
can
we
place
him
under
constraint
for
he
cannot
be
proved
to
be
mad
no
action
is
as
yet
possible
then
what
on
earth
are
we
to
do
little
patience
mr
bennett
things
will
soon
develop
unless
am
mistaken
next
tuesday
may
mark
crisis
certainly
we
shall
be
in
camford
on
that
day
meanwhile
the
general
position
is
undeniably
unpleasant
and
if
miss
presbury
can
prolong
her
visit
that
is
easy
then
let
her
stay
till
we
can
assure
her
that
all
danger
is
past
meanwhile
let
him
have
his
way
and
do
not
cross
him
so
long
as
he
is
in
good
humour
all
is
well
there
he
is
said
bennett
in
startled
whisper
looking
between
the
branches
we
saw
the
tall
erect
figure
emerge
from
the
hall
door
and
look
around
him
he
stood
leaning
forward
his
hands
swinging
straight
before
him
his
head
turning
from
side
to
side
the
secretary
with
last
wave
slipped
off
among
the
trees
and
we
saw
him
presently
rejoin
his
employer
the
two
entering
the
house
together
in
what
seemed
to
be
animated
and
even
excited
conversation
expect
the
old
gentleman
has
been
putting
two
and
two
together
said
holmes
as
we
walked
hotelward
he
struck
me
as
having
particularly
clear
and
logical
brain
from
the
little
saw
of
him
explosive
no
doubt
but
then
from
his
point
of
view
he
has
something
to
explode
about
if
detectives
are
put
on
his
track
and
he
suspects
his
own
household
of
doing
it
rather
fancy
that
friend
bennett
is
in
for
an
uncomfortable
time
holmes
stopped
at
post
office
and
sent
off
telegram
on
our
way
the
answer
reached
us
in
the
evening
and
he
tossed
it
across
to
me
have
visited
the
commercial
road
and
seen
dorak
suave
person
bohemian
elderly
keeps
large
general
store
mercer
is
since
your
time
said
holmes
he
is
my
general
utility
man
who
looks
up
routine
business
it
was
important
to
know
something
of
the
man
with
whom
our
professor
was
so
secretly
corresponding
his
nationality
connects
up
with
the
prague
visit
thank
goodness
that
something
connects
with
something
said
at
present
we
seem
to
be
faced
by
long
series
of
inexplicable
incidents
with
no
bearing
upon
each
other
for
example
what
possible
connection
can
there
be
between
an
angry
wolfhound
and
visit
to
bohemia
or
either
of
them
with
man
crawling
down
passage
at
night
as
to
your
dates
that
is
the
biggest
mystification
of
all
holmes
smiled
and
rubbed
his
hands
we
were
may
say
seated
in
the
old
sitting
room
of
the
ancient
hotel
with
bottle
of
the
famous
vintage
of
which
holmes
had
spoken
on
the
table
between
us
well
now
let
us
take
the
dates
first
said
he
his
fingertips
together
and
his
manner
as
if
he
were
addressing
class
this
excellent
young
man
diary
shows
that
there
was
trouble
upon
july
2d
and
from
then
onward
it
seems
to
have
been
at
nine
day
intervals
with
so
far
as
remember
only
one
exception
thus
the
last
outbreak
upon
friday
was
on
september
3d
which
also
falls
into
the
series
as
did
august
26th
which
preceded
it
the
thing
is
beyond
coincidence
was
forced
to
agree
let
us
then
form
the
provisional
theory
that
every
nine
days
the
professor
takes
some
strong
drug
which
has
passing
but
highly
poisonous
effect
his
naturally
violent
nature
is
intensified
by
it
he
learned
to
take
this
drug
while
he
was
in
prague
and
is
now
supplied
with
it
by
bohemian
intermediary
in
london
this
all
hangs
together
watson
but
the
dog
the
face
at
the
window
the
creeping
man
in
the
passage
well
we
have
made
beginning
should
not
expect
any
fresh
developments
until
next
tuesday
in
the
meantime
we
can
only
keep
in
touch
with
friend
bennett
and
enjoy
the
amenities
of
this
charming
town
in
the
morning
mr
bennett
slipped
round
to
bring
us
the
latest
report
as
holmes
had
imagined
times
had
not
been
easy
with
him
without
exactly
accusing
him
of
being
responsible
for
our
presence
the
professor
had
been
very
rough
and
rude
in
his
speech
and
evidently
felt
some
strong
grievance
this
morning
he
was
quite
himself
again
however
and
had
delivered
his
usual
brilliant
lecture
to
crowded
class
apart
from
his
queer
fits
said
bennett
he
has
actually
more
energy
and
vitality
than
can
ever
remember
nor
was
his
brain
ever
clearer
but
it
not
he
it
never
the
man
whom
we
have
known
don
think
you
have
anything
to
fear
now
for
week
at
least
holmes
answered
am
busy
man
and
dr
watson
has
his
patients
to
attend
to
let
us
agree
that
we
meet
here
at
this
hour
next
tuesday
and
shall
be
surprised
if
before
we
leave
you
again
we
are
not
able
to
explain
even
if
we
cannot
perhaps
put
an
end
to
your
troubles
meanwhile
keep
us
posted
in
what
occurs
saw
nothing
of
my
friend
for
the
next
few
days
but
on
the
following
monday
evening
had
short
note
asking
me
to
meet
him
next
day
at
the
train
from
what
he
told
me
as
we
travelled
up
to
camford
all
was
well
the
peace
of
the
professor
house
had
been
unruffled
and
his
own
conduct
perfectly
normal
this
also
was
the
report
which
was
given
us
by
mr
bennett
himself
when
he
called
upon
us
that
evening
at
our
old
quarters
in
the
chequers
he
heard
from
his
london
correspondent
to
day
there
was
letter
and
there
was
small
packet
each
with
the
cross
under
the
stamp
which
warned
me
not
to
touch
them
there
has
been
nothing
else
that
may
prove
quite
enough
said
holmes
grimly
now
mr
bennett
we
shall
think
come
to
some
conclusion
tonight
if
my
deductions
are
correct
we
should
have
an
opportunity
of
bringing
matters
to
head
in
order
to
do
so
it
is
necessary
to
hold
the
professor
under
observation
would
suggest
therefore
that
you
remain
awake
and
on
the
lookout
should
you
hear
him
pass
your
door
do
not
interrupt
him
but
follow
him
as
discreetly
as
you
can
dr
watson
and
will
not
be
far
off
by
the
way
where
is
the
key
of
that
little
box
of
which
you
spoke
upon
his
watch
chain
fancy
our
researches
must
lie
in
that
direction
at
the
worst
the
lock
should
not
be
very
formidable
have
you
any
other
able
bodied
man
on
the
premises
there
is
the
coachman
macphail
where
does
he
sleep
over
the
stables
we
might
possibly
want
him
well
we
can
do
no
more
until
we
see
how
things
develop
good
bye
but
expect
that
we
shall
see
you
before
morning
it
was
nearly
midnight
before
we
took
our
station
among
some
bushes
immediately
opposite
the
hall
door
of
the
professor
it
was
fine
night
but
chilly
and
we
were
glad
of
our
warm
overcoats
there
was
breeze
and
clouds
were
scudding
across
the
sky
obscuring
from
time
to
time
the
half
moon
it
would
have
been
dismal
vigil
were
it
not
for
the
expectation
and
excitement
which
carried
us
along
and
the
assurance
of
my
comrade
that
we
had
probably
reached
the
end
of
the
strange
sequence
of
events
which
had
engaged
our
attention

if
the
cycle
of
nine
days
holds
good
then
we
shall
have
the
professor
at
his
worst
to
night
said
holmes
the
fact
that
these
strange
symptoms
began
after
his
visit
to
prague
that
he
is
in
secret
correspondence
with
bohemian
dealer
in
london
who
presumably
represents
someone
in
prague
and
that
he
received
packet
from
him
this
very
day
all
point
in
one
direction
what
he
takes
and
why
he
takes
it
are
still
beyond
our
ken
but
that
it
emanates
in
some
way
from
prague
is
clear
enough
he
takes
it
under
definite
directions
which
regulate
this
ninth
day
system
which
was
the
first
point
which
attracted
my
attention
but
his
symptoms
are
most
remarkable
did
you
observe
his
knuckles
had
to
confess
that
did
not
thick
and
horny
in
way
which
is
quite
new
in
my
experience
always
look
at
the
hands
first
watson
then
cuffs
trouserknees
and
boots
very
curious
knuckles
which
can
only
be
explained
by
the
mode
of
progression
observed
by—
holmes
paused
and
suddenly
clapped
his
hand
to
his
forehead
oh
watson
what
fool
have
been
it
seems
incredible
and
yet
it
must
be
true
all
points
in
one
direction
how
could
miss
seeing
the
connection
of
ideas
those
knuckles
how
could
have
passed
those
knuckles
and
the
dog
and
the
ivy
it
surely
time
that
disappeared
into
that
little
farm
of
my
dreams
look
out
watson
here
he
is
we
shall
have
the
chance
of
seeing
for
ourselves
the
hall
door
had
slowly
opened
and
against
the
lamplit
background
we
saw
the
tall
figure
of
professor
presbury
he
was
clad
in
his
dressing
gown
as
he
stood
outlined
in
the
doorway
he
was
erect
but
leaning
forward
with
dangling
arms
as
when
we
saw
him
last
now
he
stepped
forward
into
the
drive
and
an
extraordinary
change
came
over
him
he
sank
down
into
crouching
position
and
moved
along
upon
his
hands
and
feet
skipping
every
now
and
then
as
if
he
were
overflowing
with
energy
and
vitality
he
moved
along
the
face
of
the
house
and
then
round
the
corner
as
he
disappeared
bennett
slipped
through
the
hall
door
and
softly
followed
him
come
watson
come
cried
holmes
and
we
stole
as
softly
as
we
could
through
the
bushes
until
we
had
gained
spot
whence
we
could
see
the
other
side
of
the
house
which
was
bathed
in
the
light
of
the
half
moon
the
professor
was
clearly
visible
crouching
at
the
foot
of
the
ivy
covered
wall
as
we
watched
him
he
suddenly
began
with
incredible
agility
to
ascend
it
from
branch
to
branch
he
sprang
sure
of
foot
and
firm
of
grasp
climbing
apparently
in
mere
joy
at
his
own
powers
with
no
definite
object
in
view
with
his
dressing
gown
flapping
on
each
side
of
him
he
looked
like
some
huge
bat
glued
against
the
side
of
his
own
house
great
square
dark
patch
upon
the
moonlit
wall
presently
he
tired
of
this
amusement
and
dropping
from
branch
to
branch
he
squatted
down
into
the
old
attitude
and
moved
towards
the
stables
creeping
along
in
the
same
strange
way
as
before
the
wolfhound
was
out
now
barking
furiously
and
more
excited
than
ever
when
it
actually
caught
sight
of
its
master
it
was
straining
on
its
chain
and
quivering
with
eagerness
and
rage
the
professor
squatted
down
very
deliberately
just
out
of
reach
of
the
hound
and
began
to
provoke
it
in
every
possible
way
he
took
handfuls
of
pebbles
from
the
drive
and
threw
them
in
the
dog
face
prodded
him
with
stick
which
he
had
picked
up
flicked
his
hands
about
only
few
inches
from
the
gaping
mouth
and
endeavoured
in
every
way
to
increase
the
animal
fury
which
was
already
beyond
all
control
in
all
our
adventures
do
not
know
that
have
ever
seen
more
strange
sight
than
this
impassive
and
still
dignified
figure
crouching
frog
like
upon
the
ground
and
goading
to
wilder
exhibition
of
passion
the
maddened
hound
which
ramped
and
raged
in
front
of
him
by
all
manner
of
ingenious
and
calculated
cruelty
and
then
in
moment
it
happened
it
was
not
the
chain
that
broke
but
it
was
the
collar
that
slipped
for
it
had
been
made
for
thick
necked
newfoundland
we
heard
the
rattle
of
falling
metal
and
the
next
instant
dog
and
man
were
rolling
on
the
ground
together
the
one
roaring
in
rage
the
other
screaming
in
strange
shrill
falsetto
of
terror
it
was
very
narrow
thing
for
the
professor
life
the
savage
creature
had
him
fairly
by
the
throat
its
fangs
had
bitten
deep
and
he
was
senseless
before
we
could
reach
them
and
drag
the
two
apart
it
might
have
been
dangerous
task
for
us
but
bennett
voice
and
presence
brought
the
great
wolflhound
instantly
to
reason
the
uproar
had
brought
the
sleepy
and
astonished
coachman
from
his
room
above
the
stables
not
surprised
said
he
shaking
his
head
ve
seen
him
at
it
before
knew
the
dog
would
get
him
sooner
or
later
the
hound
was
secured
and
together
we
carried
the
professor
up
to
his
room
where
bennett
who
had
medical
degree
helped
me
to
dress
his
torn
throat
the
sharp
teeth
had
passed
dangerously
near
the
carotid
artery
and
the
haemorrhage
was
serious
in
half
an
hour
the
danger
was
past
had
given
the
patient
an
injection
of
morphia
and
he
had
sunk
into
deep
sleep
then
and
only
then
were
we
able
to
look
at
each
other
and
to
take
stock
of
the
situation
think
first
class
surgeon
should
see
him
said
for
god
sake
no
cried
bennett
at
present
the
scandal
is
confined
to
our
own
household
it
is
safe
with
us
if
it
gets
beyond
these
walls
it
will
never
stop
consider
his
position
at
the
university
his
european
reputation
the
feelings
of
his
daughter
quite
so
said
holmes
think
it
may
be
quite
possible
to
keep
the
matter
to
ourselves
and
also
to
prevent
its
recurrence
now
that
we
have
free
hand
the
key
from
the
watch
chain
mr
bennett
macphail
will
guard
the
patient
and
let
us
know
if
there
is
any
change
let
us
see
what
we
can
find
in
the
professor
mysterious
box
there
was
not
much
but
there
was
enough
an
empty
phial
another
nearly
full
hypodermic
syringe
several
letters
in
crabbed
foreign
hand
the
marks
on
the
envelopes
showed
that
they
were
those
which
had
disturbed
the
routine
of
the
secretary
and
each
was
dated
from
the
commercial
road
and
signed
dorak
they
were
mere
invoices
to
say
that
fresh
bottle
was
being
sent
to
professor
presbury
or
receipt
to
acknowledge
money
there
was
one
other
envelope
however
in
more
educated
hand
and
bearing
the
austrian
stamp
with
the
postmark
of
prague
here
we
have
our
material
cried
holmes
as
he
tore
out
the
enclosure
honoured
colleague
it
ran
since
your
esteemed
visit
have
thought
much
of
your
case
and
though
in
your
circumstances
there
are
some
special
reasons
for
the
treatment
would
none
the
less
enjoin
caution
as
my
results
have
shown
that
it
is
not
without
danger
of
kind
it
is
possible
that
the
serum
of
anthropoid
would
have
been
better
have
as
explained
to
you
used
black
faced
langur
because
specimen
was
accessible
langur
is
of
course
crawler
and
climber
while
anthropoid
walks
erect
and
is
in
all
ways
nearer
beg
you
to
take
every
possible
precaution
that
there
be
no
premature
revelation
of
the
process
have
one
other
client
in
england
and
dorak
is
my
agent
for
both
weekly
reports
will
oblige
yours
with
high
esteem
lowenstein
the
name
brought
back
to
me
the
memory
of
some
snippet
from
newspaper
which
spoke
of
an
obscure
scientist
who
was
striving
in
some
unknown
way
for
the
secret
of
rejuvenescence
and
the
elixir
of
life
lowenstein
of
prague
lowenstein
with
the
wondrous
strength
giving
serum
tabooed
by
the
profession
because
he
refused
to
reveal
its
source
in
few
words
said
what
remembered
bennett
had
taken
manual
of
zoology
from
the
shelves
langur
he
read
the
great
black
faced
monkey
of
the
himalayan
slopes
biggest
and
most
human
of
climbing
monkeys
many
details
are
added
well
thanks
to
you
mr
holmes
it
is
very
clear
that
we
have
traced
the
evil
to
its
source
the
real
source
said
holmes
lies
of
course
in
that
untimely
love
affair
which
gave
our
impetuous
professor
the
idea
that
he
could
only
gain
his
wish
by
turning
himself
into
younger
man
when
one
tries
to
rise
above
nature
one
is
liable
to
fall
below
it
the
highest
type
of
man
may
revert
to
the
animal
if
he
leaves
the
straight
road
of
destiny
he
sat
musing
for
little
with
the
phial
in
his
hand
looking
at
the
clear
liquid
within
when
have
written
to
this
man
and
told
him
that
hold
him
criminally
responsible
for
the
poisons
which
he
circulates
we
will
have
no
more
trouble
but
it
may
recur
others
may
find
better
way
there
is
danger
there
very
real
danger
to
humanity
consider
watson
that
the
material
the
sensual
the
worldly
would
all
prolong
their
worthless
lives
the
spiritual
would
not
avoid
the
call
to
something
higher
it
would
be
the
survival
of
the
least
fit
what
sort
of
cesspool
may
not
our
poor
world
become
suddenly
the
dreamer
disappeared
and
holmes
the
man
of
action
sprang
from
his
chair
think
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
mr
bennett
the
various
incidents
will
now
fit
themselves
easily
into
the
general
scheme
the

of

was
aware
of
the

far
more
quickly

you

not
the

attacked

it
was
the

who
teased
roy
climbing
was
joy
to
the

and
it
was
mere

take
it
that
the
pastime
brought
him

iv
the
adventure
of
the
sussex
vampire
holmes
had
read
carefully
note
which
the
last
post
had
brought
him
then
with
the
dry
chuckle
which
was
his
nearest
approach
to
laugh
he
tossed
it
over
to
me
for
mixture
of
the
modern
and
the
mediaeval
of
the
practical
and
of
the
wildly
fanciful
think
this
is
surely
the
limit
said
he
what
do
you
make
of
it
watson
read
as
follows
46
old
jewry
nov
19th
re
vampires
sir
our
client
mr
robert
ferguson
of
ferguson
and
muirhead
tea
brokers
of
mincing
lane
has
made
some
inquiry
from
us
in
communication
of
even
date
concerning
vampires
as
our
firm
specializes
entirely
upon
the
assessment
of
machinery
the
matter
hardly
comes
within
our
purview
and
we
have
therefore
recommended
mr
ferguson
to
call
upon
you
and
lay
the
matter
before
you
we
have
not
forgotten
your
successful
action
in
the
case
of
matilda
briggs
we
are
sir
faithfully
yours
morrison
and
dodd
per
matilda
briggs
was
not
the
name
of
young
woman
watson
said
holmes
in
reminiscent
voice
it
was
ship
which
is
associated
with
the
giant
rat
of
sumatra
story
for
which
the
world
is
not
yet
prepared
but
what
do
we
know
about
vampires
does
it
come
within
our
purview
either
anything
is
better
than
stagnation
but
really
we
seem
to
have
been
switched
on
to
grimms
fairy
tale
make
long
arm
watson
and
see
what
has
to
say
leaned
back
and
took
down
the
great
index
volume
to
which
he
referred
holmes
balanced
it
on
his
knee
and
his
eyes
moved
slowly
and
lovingly
over
the
record
of
old
cases
mixed
with
the
accumulated
information
of
lifetime
voyage
of
the
gloria
scott
he
read
that
was
bad
business
have
some
recollection
that
you
made
record
of
it
watson
though
was
unable
to
congratulate
you
upon
the
result
victor

hullo
good
old

you
can

listen
to
this
watson
vampirism
in
hungary
and
again
vampires
in
transylvania
he
turned
over
the
pages
with
eagerness
but
after
short
intent
perusal
he
threw
down
the
great
book
with
snarl
of
disappointment
rubbish
watson
rubbish
what
have
we
to
do
with
walking
corpses
who
can
only
be
held
in
their
grave
by
stakes
driven
through
their
hearts
it
pure
lunacy
but
surely
said
the
vampire
was
not
necessarily
dead
man
living
person
might
have
the
habit
have
read
for
example
of
the
old
sucking
the
blood
of
the
young
in
order
to
retain
their
youth
you
are
right
watson
it
mentions
the
legend
in
one
of
these
references
but
are
we
to
give
serious
attention
to
such
things
this
agency
stands
flat
footed
upon
the
ground
and
there
it
must
remain
the
world
is
big
enough
for
us
no
ghosts
need
apply
fear
that
we
cannot
take
mr
robert
ferguson
very
seriously
possibly
this
note
may
be
from
him
and
may
throw
some
light
upon
what
is
worrying
him
he
took
up
second
letter
which
had
lain
unnoticed
upon
the
table
while
he
had
been
absorbed
with
the
first
this
he
began
to
read
with
smile
of
amusement
upon
his
face
which
gradually
faded
away
into
an
expression
of
intense
interest
and
concentration
when
he
had
finished
he
sat
for
some
little
time
lost
in
thought
with
the
letter
dangling
from
his
fingers
finally
with
start
he
aroused
himself
from
his
reverie
cheeseman
lamberley
where
is
lamberley
watson
it
is
in
sussex
south
of
horsham
not
very
far
eh
and
cheeseman
know
that
country
holmes
it
is
full
of
old
houses
which
are
named
after
the
men
who
built
them
centuries
ago
you
get
odley
and
harvey
and
carriton
the
folk
are
forgotten
but
their
names
live
in
their
houses
precisely
said
holmes
coldly
it
was
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
his
proud
self
contained
nature
that
though
he
docketed
any
fresh
information
very
quietly
and
accurately
in
his
brain
he
seldom
made
any
acknowledgment
to
the
giver
rather
fancy
we
shall
know
good
deal
more
about
cheeseman
lamberley
before
we
are
through
the
letter
is
as
had
hoped
from
robert
ferguson
by
the
way
he
claims
acquaintance
with
you
with
me
you
had
better
read
it
he
handed
the
letter
across
it
was
headed
with
the
address
quoted
dear
mr
holmes
it
said
have
been
recommended
to
you
by
my
lawyers
but
indeed
the
matter
is
so
extraordinarily
delicate
that
it
is
most
difficult
to
discuss
it
concerns
friend
for
whom
am
acting
this
gentleman
married
some
five
years
ago
peruvian
lady
the
daughter
of
peruvian
merchant
whom
he
had
met
in
connection
with
the
importation
of
nitrates
the
lady
was
very
beautiful
but
the
fact
of
her
foreign
birth
and
of
her
alien
religion
always
caused
separation
of
interests
and
of
feelings
between
husband
and
wife
so
that
after
time
his
love
may
have
cooled
towards
her
and
he
may
have
come
to
regard
their
union
as
mistake
he
felt
there
were
sides
of
her
character
which
he
could
never
explore
or
understand
this
was
the
more
painful
as
she
was
as
loving
wife
as
man
could
have
to
all
appearance
absolutely
devoted
now
for
the
point
which
will
make
more
plain
when
we
meet
indeed
this
note
is
merely
to
give
you
general
idea
of
the
situation
and
to
ascertain
whether
you
would
care
to
interest
yourself
in
the
matter
the
lady
began
to
show
some
curious
traits
quite
alien
to
her
ordinarily
sweet
and
gentle
disposition
the
gentleman
had
been
married
twice
and
he
had
one
son
by
the
first
wife
this
boy
was
now
fifteen
very
charming
and
affectionate
youth
though
unhappily
injured
through
an
accident
in
childhood
twice
the
wife
was
caught
in
the
act
of
assaulting
this
poor
lad
in
the
most
unprovoked
way
once
she
struck
him
with
stick
and
left
great
weal
on
his
arm
this
was
small
matter
however
compared
with
her
conduct
to
her
own
child
dear
boy
just
under
one
year
of
age
on
one
occasion
about
month
ago
this
child
had
been
left
by
its
nurse
for
few
minutes
loud
cry
from
the
baby
as
of
pain
called
the
nurse
back
as
she
ran
into
the
room
she
saw
her
employer
the
lady
leaning
over
the
baby
and
apparently
biting
his
neck
there
was
small
wound
in
the
neck
from
which
stream
of
blood
had
escaped
the
nurse
was
so
horrified
that
she
wished
to
call
the
husband
but
the
lady
implored
her
not
to
do
so
and
actually
gave
her
five
pounds
as
price
for
her
silence
no
explanation
was
ever
given
and
for
the
moment
the
matter
was
passed
over
it
left
however
terrible
impression
upon
the
nurse
mind
and
from
that
time
she
began
to
watch
her
mistress
closely
and
to
keep
closer
guard
upon
the
baby
whom
she
tenderly
loved
it
seemed
to
her
that
even
as
she
watched
the
mother
so
the
mother
watched
her
and
that
every
time
she
was
compelled
to
leave
the
baby
alone
the
mother
was
waiting
to
get
at
it
day
and
night
the
nurse
covered
the
child
and
day
and
night
the
silent
watchful
mother
seemed
to
be
lying
in
wait
as
wolf
waits
for
lamb
it
must
read
most
incredible
to
you
and
yet
beg
you
to
take
it
seriously
for
child
life
and
man
sanity
may
depend
upon
it
at
last
there
came
one
dreadful
day
when
the
facts
could
no
longer
be
concealed
from
the
husband
the
nurse
nerve
had
given
way
she
could
stand
the
strain
no
longer
and
she
made
clean
breast
of
it
all
to
the
man
to
him
it
seemed
as
wild
tale
as
it
may
now
seem
to
you
he
knew
his
wife
to
be
loving
wife
and
save
for
the
assaults
upon
her
stepson
loving
mother
why
then
should
she
wound
her
own
dear
little
baby
he
told
the
nurse
that
she
was
dreaming
that
her
suspicions
were
those
of
lunatic
and
that
such
libels
upon
her
mistress
were
not
to
be
tolerated
while
they
were
talking
sudden
cry
of
pain
was
heard
nurse
and
master
rushed
together
to
the
nursery
imagine
his
feelings
mr
holmes
as
he
saw
his
wife
rise
from
kneeling
position
beside
the
cot
and
saw
blood
upon
the
child
exposed
neck
and
upon
the
sheet
with
cry
of
horror
he
turned
his
wife
face
to
the
light
and
saw
blood
all
round
her
lips
it
was
she
beyond
all
question
who
had
drunk
the
poor
baby
blood
so
the
matter
stands
she
is
now
confined
to
her
room
there
has
been
no
explanation
the
husband
is
half
demented
he
knows
and
know
little
of
vampirism
beyond
the
name
we
had
thought
it
was
some
wild
tale
of
foreign
parts
and
yet
here
in
the
very
heart
of
the
english
sussex
well
all
this
can
be
discussed
with
you
in
the
morning
will
you
see
me
will
you
use
your
great
powers
in
aiding
distracted
man
if
so
kindly
wire
to
ferguson
cheeseman
lamberley
and
will
be
at
your
rooms
by
ten
clock

faithfully

believe
your
friend
watson
played
rugby
for
blackheath
when
was
three
quarter
for
richmond
it
is
the
only
personal
introduction
which
can
give
of
course
remembered
him
said
as
laid
down
the
letter
big
bob
ferguson
the
finest
three
quarter
richmond
ever
had
he
was
always
good
natured
chap
it
like
him
to
be
so
concerned
over
friend
case
holmes
looked
at
me
thoughtfully
and
shook
his
head
never
get
your
limits
watson
said
he
there
are
unexplored
possibilities
about
you
take
wire
down
like
good
fellow
will
examine
your
case
with
pleasure
your
case
we
must
not
let
him
think
that
this
agency
is
home
for
the
weak
minded
of
course
it
is
his
case
send
him
that
wire
and
let
the
matter
rest
till
morning
promptly
at
ten
clock
next
morning
ferguson
strode
into
our
room
had
remembered
him
as
long
slab
sided
man
with
loose
limbs
and
fine
turn
of
speed
which
had
carried
him
round
many
an
opposing
back
there
is
surely
nothing
in
life
more
painful
than
to
meet
the
wreck
of
fine
athlete
whom
one
has
known
in
his
prime
his
great
frame
had
fallen
in
his
flaxen
hair
was
scanty
and
his
shoulders
were
bowed
fear
that
roused
corresponding
emotions
in
him
hullo
watson
said
he
and
his
voice
was
still
deep
and
hearty
you
don
look
quite
the
man
you
did
when
threw
you
over
the
ropes
into
the
crowd
at
the
old
deer
park
expect
have
changed
bit
also
but
it
this
last
day
or
two
that
has
aged
me
see
by
your
telegram
mr
holmes
that
it
is
no
use
my
pretending
to
be
anyone
deputy
it
is
simpler
to
deal
direct
said
holmes
of
course
it
is
but
you
can
imagine
how
difficult
it
is
when
you
are
speaking
of
the
one
woman
whom
you
are
bound
to
protect
and
help
what
can
do
how
am
to
go
to
the
police
with
such
story
and
yet
the
kiddies
have
got
to
be
protected
is
it
madness
mr
holmes
is
it
something
in
the
blood
have
you
any
similar
case
in
your
experience
for
god
sake
give
me
some
advice
for
am
at
my
wit
end
very
naturally
mr
ferguson
now
sit
here
and
pull
yourself
together
and
give
me
few
clear
answers
can
assure
you
that
am
very
far
from
being
at
my
wit
end
and
that
am
confident
we
shall
find
some
solution
first
of
all
tell
me
what
steps
you
have
taken
is
your
wife
still
near
the
children
we
had
dreadful
scene
she
is
most
loving
woman
mr
holmes
if
ever
woman
loved
man
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
she
loves
me
she
was
cut
to
the
heart
that
should
have
discovered
this
horrible
this
incredible
secret
she
would
not
even
speak
she
gave
no
answer
to
my
reproaches
save
to
gaze
at
me
with
sort
of
wild
despairing
look
in
her
eyes
then
she
rushed
to
her
room
and
locked
herself
in
since
then
she
has
refused
to
see
me
she
has
maid
who
was
with
her
before
her
marriage
dolores
by
name
friend
rather
than
servant
she
takes
her
food
to
her
then
the
child
is
in
no
immediate
danger
mrs
mason
the
nurse
has
sworn
that
she
will
not
leave
it
night
or
day
can
absolutely
trust
her
am
more
uneasy
about
poor
little
jack
for
as
told
you
in
my
note
he
has
twice
been
assaulted
by
her
but
never
wounded
no
she
struck
him
savagely
it
is
the
more
terrible
as
he
is
poor
little
inoffensive
cripple
ferguson
gaunt
features
softened
as
he
spoke
of
his
boy
you
would
think
that
the
dear
lad
condition
would
soften
anyone
heart
fall
in
childhood
and
twisted
spine
mr
holmes
but
the
dearest
most
loving
heart
within
holmes
had
picked
up
the
letter
of
yesterday
and
was
reading
it
over
what
other
inmates
are
there
in
your
house
mr
ferguson
two
servants
who
have
not
been
long
with
us
one
stablehand
michael
who
sleeps
in
the
house
my
wife
myself
my
boy
jack
baby
dolores
and
mrs
mason
that
is
all
gather
that
you
did
not
know
your
wife
well
at
the
time
of
your
marriage
had
only
known
her
few
weeks
how
long
had
this
maid
dolores
been
with
her
some
years
then
your
wife
character
would
really
be
better
known
by
dolores
than
by
you
yes
you
may
say
so
holmes
made
note
fancy
said
he
that
may
be
of
more
use
at
lamberley
than
here
it
is
eminently
case
for
personal
investigation
if
the
lady
remains
in
her
room
our
presence
could
not
annoy
or
inconvenience
her
of
course
we
would
stay
at
the
inn
ferguson
gave
gesture
of
relief
it
is
what
hoped
mr
holmes
there
is
an
excellent
train
at
two
from
victoria
if
you
could
come
of
course
we
could
come
there
is
lull
at
present
can
give
you
my
undivided
energies
watson
of
course
comes
with
us
but
there
are
one
or
two
points
upon
which
wish
to
be
very
sure
before
start
this
unhappy
lady
as
understand
it
has
appeared
to
assault
both
the
children
her
own
baby
and
your
little
son
that
is
so
but
the
assaults
take
different
forms
do
they
not
she
has
beaten
your
son
once
with
stick
and
once
very
savagely
with
her
hands
did
she
give
no
explanation
why
she
struck
him
none
save
that
she
hated
him
again
and
again
she
said
so
well
that
is
not
unknown
among
stepmothers
posthumous
jealousy
we
will
say
is
the
lady
jealous
by
nature
yes
she
is
very
jealous
with
all
the
strength
of
her
fiery
tropical
love
but
the
boy
he
is
fifteen
understand
and
probably
very
developed
in
mind
since
his
body
has
been
circumscribed
in
action
did
he
give
you
no
explanation
of
these
assaults
no
he
declared
there
was
no
reason
were
they
good
friends
at
other
times
no
there
was
never
any
love
between
them
yet
you
say
he
is
affectionate
never
in
the
world
could
there
be
so
devoted
son
my
life
is
his
life
he
is
absorbed
in
what
say
or
do
once
again
holmes
made
note
for
some
time
he
sat
lost
in
thought
no
doubt
you
and
the
boy
were
great
comrades
before
this
second
marriage
you
were
thrown
very
close
together
were
you
not
very
much
so
and
the
boy
having
so
affectionate
nature
was
devoted
no
doubt
to
the
memory
of
his
mother
most
devoted
he
would
certainly
seem
to
be
most
interesting
lad
there
is
one
other
point
about
these
assaults
were
the
strange
attacks
upon
the
baby
and
the
assaults
upon
yow
son
at
the
same
period
in
the
first
case
it
was
so
it
was
as
if
some
frenzy
had
seized
her
and
she
had
vented
her
rage
upon
both
in
the
second
case
it
was
only
jack
who
suffered
mrs
mason
had
no
complaint
to
make
about
the
baby
that
certainly
complicates
matters
don
quite
follow
you
mr
holmes
possibly
not
one
forms
provisional
theories
and
waits
for
time
or
fuller
knowledge
to
explode
them
bad
habit
mr
ferguson
but
human
nature
is
weak
fear
that
your
old
friend
here
has
given
an
exaggerated
view
of
my
scientific
methods
however
will
only
say
at
the
present
stage
that
your
problem
does
not
appear
to
me
to
be
insoluble
and
that
you
may
expect
to
find
us
at
victoria
at
two
clock
it
was
evening
of
dull
foggy
november
day
when
having
left
our
bags
at
the
chequers
lamberley
we
drove
through
the
sussex
clay
of
long
winding
lane
and
finally
reached
the
isolated
and
ancient
farmhouse
in
which
ferguson
dwelt
it
was
large
straggling
building
very
old
in
the
centre
very
new
at
the
wings
with
towering
tudor
chimneys
and
lichen
spotted
high
pitched
roof
of
horsham
slabs
the
doorsteps
were
worn
into
curves
and
the
ancient
tiles
which
lined
the
porch
were
marked
with
the
rebus
of
cheese
and
man
after
the
original
builder
within
the
ceilings
were
corrugated
with
heavy
oaken
beams
and
the
uneven
floors
sagged
into
sharp
curves
an
odour
of
age
and
decay
pervaded
the
whole
crumbling
building
there
was
one
very
large
central
room
into
which
ferguson
led
us
here
in
huge
old
fashioned
fireplace
with
an
iron
screen
behind
it
dated
1670
there
blazed
and
spluttered
splendid
log
fire
the
room
as
gazed
round
was
most
singular
mixture
of
dates
and
of
places
the
half
panelled
walls
may
well
have
belonged
to
the
original
yeoman
farmer
of
the
seventeenth
century
they
were
ornamented
however
on
the
lower
part
by
line
of
well
chosen
modern
water
colours
while
above
where
yellow
plaster
took
the
place
of
oak
there
was
hung
fine
collection
of
south
american
utensils
and
weapons
which
had
been
brought
no
doubt
by
the
peruvian
lady
upstairs
holmes
rose
with
that
quick
curiosity
which
sprang
from
his
eager
mind
and
examined
them
with
some
care
he
returned
with
his
eyes
full
of
thought
hullo
he
cried
hullo
spaniel
had
lain
in
basket
in
the
corner
it
came
slowly
forward
towards
its
master
walking
with
difficulty
its
hind
legs
moved
irregularly
and
its
tail
was
on
the
ground
it
licked
ferguson
hand

what
is
it
mr
holmes
the
dog
what
the
matter
with
it
that
what
puzzled
the
vet
sort
of
paralysis
spinal
meningitis
he
thought
but
it
is
passing
he
ll
be
all
right
soon
won
you
carlo
shiver
of
assent
passed
through
the
drooping
tail
the
dog
mournful
eyes
passed
from
one
of
us
to
the
other
he
knew
that
we
were
discussing
his
case
did
it
come
on
suddenly
in
single
night
how
long
ago
it
may
have
been
four
months
ago
very
remarkable
very
suggestive
what
do
you
see
in
it
mr
holmes
confirmation
of
what
had
already
thought
for
god
sake
what
do
you
think
mr
holmes
it
may
be
mere
intellectual
puzzle
to
you
but
it
is
life
and
death
to
me
my
wife
would
be
murderer
my
child
in
constant
danger
don
play
with
me
mr
holmes
it
is
too
terribly
serious
the
big
rugby
three
quarter
was
trembling
all
over
holmes
put
his
hand
soothingly
upon
his
arm
fear
that
there
is
pain
for
you
mr
ferguson
whatever
the
solution
may
be
said
he
would
spare
you
all
can
cannot
say
more
for
the
instant
but
before
leave
this
house
hope
may
have
something
definite
please
god
you
may
if
you
will
excuse
me
gentlemen
will
go
up
to
my
wife
room
and
see
if
there
has
been
any
change
he
was
away
some
minutes
during
which
holmes
resumed
his
examination
of
the
curiosities
upon
the
wall
when
our
host
returned
it
was
clear
from
his
downcast
face
that
he
had
made
no
progress
he
brought
with
him
tall
slim
brown
faced
girl
the
tea
is
ready
dolores
said
ferguson
see
that
your
mistress
has
everything
she
can
wish
she
verra
ill
cried
the
girl
looking
with
indignant
eyes
at
her
master
she
no
ask
for
food
she
verra
ill
she
need
doctor
frightened
stay
alone
with
her
without
doctor
ferguson
looked
at
me
with
question
in
his
eyes
should
be
so
glad
if
could
be
of
use
would
your
mistress
see
dr
watson
take
him
no
ask
leave
she
needs
doctor
then
ll
come
with
you
at
once
followed
the
girl
who
was
quivering
with
strong
emotion
up
the
staircase
and
down
an
ancient
corridor
at
the
end
was
an
iron
clamped
and
massive
door
it
struck
me
as
looked
at
it
that
if
ferguson
tried
to
force
his
way
to
his
wife
he
would
find
it
no
easy
matter
the
girl
drew
key
from
her
pocket
and
the
heavy
oaken
planks
creaked
upon
their
old
hinges
passed
in
and
she
swiftly
followed
fastening
the
door
behind
her
on
the
bed
woman
was
lying
who
was
clearly
in
high
fever
she
was
only
half
conscious
but
as
entered
she
raised
pair
of
frightened
but
beautiful
eyes
and
glared
at
me
in
apprehension
seeing
stranger
she
appeared
to
be
relieved
and
sank
back
with
sigh
upon
the
pillow
stepped
up
to
her
with
few
reassuring
words
and
she
lay
still
while
took
her
pulse
and
temperature
both
were
high
and
yet
my
impression
was
that
the
condition
was
rather
that
of
mental
and
nervous
excitement
than
of
any
actual
seizure
she
lie
like
that
one
day
two
day
fraid
she
die
said
the
girl
the
woman
turned
her
flushed
and
handsome
face
towards
me
where
is
my
husband
he
is
below
and
would
wish
to
see
you
will
not
see
him
will
not
see
him
then
she
seemed
to
wander
off
into
delirium
fiend
oh
what
shall
do
with
this
devil
can
help
you
in
any
way
no
one
can
help
it
is
finished
all
is
destroyed
do
what
will
all
is
destroyed
the
woman
must
have
some
strange
delusion
could
not
see
honest
bob
ferguson
in
the
character
of
fiend
or
devil
madame
said
your
husband
loves
you
dearly
he
is
deeply
grieved
at
this
happening
again
she
turned
on
me
those
glorious
eyes
he
loves
me
yes
but
do
not
love
him
do
not
love
him
even
to
sacrifice
myself
rather
than
break
his
dear
heart
that
is
how
love
him
and
yet
he
could
think
of
me
he
could
speak
of
me
so
he
is
full
of
grief
but
he
cannot
understand
no
he
cannot
understand
but
he
should
trust
will
you
not
see
him
suggested
no
cannot
forget
those
terrible
words
nor
the
look
upon
his
face
will
not
see
him
go
now
you
can
do
nothing
for
me
tell
him
only
one
thing
want
my
child
have
right
to
my
child
that
is
the
only
message
can
send
him
she
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
and
would
say
no
more
returned
to
the
room
downstairs
where
ferguson
and
holmes
still
sat
by
the
fire
ferguson
listened
moodily
to
my
account
of
the
interview
how
can
send
her
the
child
he
said
how
do
know
what
strange
impulse
might
come
upon
her
how
can
ever
forget
how
she
rose
from
beside
it
with
its
blood
upon
her
lips
he
shuddered
at
the
recollection
the
child
is
safe
with
mrs
mason
and
there
he
must
remain
smart
maid
the
only
modern
thing
which
we
had
seen
in
the
house
had
brought
in
some
tea
as
she
was
serving
it
the
door
opened
and
youth
entered
the
room
he
was
remarkable
lad
pale
faced
and
fair
haired
with
excitable
light
blue
eyes
which
blazed
into
sudden
flame
of
emotion
and
joy
as
they
rested
upon
his
father
he
rushed
forward
and
threw
his
arms
round
his
neck
with
the
abandon
of
loving
girl
oh
daddy
he
cried
did
not
know
that
you
were
due
yet
should
have
been
here
to
meet
you
oh
am
so
glad
to
see
you
ferguson
gently
disengaged
himself
from
the
embrace
with
some
little
show
of
embarrassment
dear
old
chap
said
he
patting
the
flaxen
head
with
very
tender
hand
came
early
because
my
friends
mr
holmes
and
dr
watson
have
been
persuaded
to
come
down
and
spend
an
evening
with
us
is
that
mr
holmes
the
detective
yes
the
youth
looked
at
us
with
very
penetrating
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
unfriendly
gaze
what
about
your
other
child
mr
ferguson
asked
holmes
might
we
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
baby
ask
mrs
mason
to
bring
baby
down
said
ferguson
the
boy
went
off
with
curious
shambling
gait
which
told
my
surgical
eyes
that
he
was
suffering
from
weak
spine
presently
he
returned
and
behind
him
came
tall
gaunt
woman
bearing
in
her
arms
very
beautiful
child
dark
eyed
golden
haired
wonderful
mixture
of
the
saxon
and
the
latin
ferguson
was
evidently
devoted
to
it
for
he
took
it
into
his
arms
and
fondled
it
most
tenderly
fancy
anyone
having
the
heart
to
hurt
him
he
muttered
as
he
glanced
down
at
the
small
angry
red
pucker
upon
the
cherub
throat
it
was
at
this
moment
that
chanced
to
glance
at
holmes
and
saw
most
singular
intentness
in
his
expression
his
face
was
as
set
as
if
it
had
been
carved
out
of
old
ivory
and
his
eyes
which
had
glanced
for
moment
at
father
and
child
were
now
fixed
with
eager
curiosity
upon
something
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
following
his
gaze
could
only
guess
that
he
was
looking
out
through
the
window
at
the
melancholy
dripping
garden
it
is
true
that
shutter
had
half
closed
outside
and
obstructed
the
view
but
none
the
less
it
was
certainly
at
the
window
that
holmes
was
fixing
his
concentrated
attention
then
he
smiled
and
his
eyes
came
back
to
the
baby
on
its
chubby
neck
there
was
this
small
puckered
mark
without
speaking
holmes
examined
it
with
care
finally
he
shook
one
of
the
dimpled
fists
which
waved
in
front
of
him
good
bye
little
man
you
have
made
strange
start
in
life
nurse
should
wish
to
have
word
with
you
in
private
he
took
her
aside
and
spoke
earnestly
for
few
minutes
only
heard
the
last
words
which
were
your
anxiety
will
soon
hope
be
set
at
rest
the
woman
who
seemed
to
be
sour
silent
kind
of
creature
withdrew
with
the
child
what
is
mrs
mason
like
asked
holmes
not
very
prepossessing
externally
as
you
can
see
but
heart
of
gold
and
devoted
to
the
child
do
you
like
her
jack
holmes
turned
suddenly
upon
the
boy
his
expressive
mobile
face
shadowed
over
and
he
shook
his
head
jacky
has
very
strong
likes
and
dislikes
said
ferguson
putting
his
arm
round
the
boy
luckily
am
one
of
his
likes
the
boy
cooed
and
nestled
his
head
upon
his
father
breast
ferguson
gently
disengaged
him
run
away
little
jacky
said
he
and
he
watched
his
son
with
loving
eyes
until
he
disappeared
now
mr
holmes
he
continued
when
the
boy
was
gone
really
feel
that
have
brought
you
on
fool
errand
for
what
can
you
possibly
do
save
give
me
your
sympathy
it
must
be
an
exceedingly
delicate
and
complex
affair
from
your
point
of
view
it
is
certainly
delicate
said
my
friend
with
an
amused
smile
but
have
not
been
struck
up
to
now
with
its
complexity
it
has
been
case
for
intellectual
deduction
but
when
this
original
intellectual
deduction
is
confirmed
point
by
point
by
quite
number
of
independent
incidents
then
the
subjective
becomes
objective
and
we
can
say
confidently
that
we
have
reached
our
goal
had
in
fact
reached
it
before
we
left
baker
street
and
the
rest
has
merely
been
observation
and
confirmation

ferguson
put
his
big
hand
to
his
furrowed
forehead
for
heaven
sake
holmes
he
said
hoarsely
if
you
can
see
the
truth
in
this
matter
do
not
keep
me
in
suspense
how
do
stand
what
shall
do
care
nothing
as
to
how
you
have
found
your
facts
so
long
as
you
have
really
got
them
certainly
owe
you
an
explanation
and
you
shall
have
it
but
you
will
permit
me
to
handle
the
matter
in
my
own
way
is
the
lady
capable
of
seeing
us
watson
she
is
ill
but
she
is
quite
rational
very
good
it
is
only
in
her
presence
that
we
can
clear
the
matter
up
let
us
go
up
to
her
she
will
not
see
me
cried
ferguson
oh
yes
she
will
said
holmes
he
scribbled
few
lines
upon
sheet
of
paper
you
at
least
have
the
entree
watson
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
give
the
lady
this
note
ascended
again
and
handed
the
note
to
dolores
who
cautiously
opened
the
door
minute
later
heard
cry
from
within
cry
in
which
joy
and
surprise
seemed
to
be
blended
dolores
looked
out
she
will
see
them
she
will
leesten
said
she
at
my
summons
ferguson
and
holmes
came
up
as
we
entered
the
room
ferguson
took
step
or
two
towards
his
wife
who
had
raised
herself
in
the
bed
but
she
held
out
her
hand
to
repulse
him
he
sank
into
an
armchair
while
holmes
seated
himself
beside
him
after
bowing
to
the
lady
who
looked
at
him
with
wide
eyed
amazement
think
we
can
dispense
with
dolores
said
holmes
oh
very
well
madame
if
you
would
rather
she
stayed
can
see
no
objection
now
mr
ferguson
am
busy
man
with
many
calls
and
my
methods
have
to
be
short
and
direct
the
swiftest
surgery
is
the
least
painful
let
me
first
say
what
will
ease
your
mind
your
wife
is
very
good
very
loving
and
very
ill
used
woman
ferguson
sat
up
with
cry
of
joy
prove
that
mr
holmes
and
am
your
debtor
forever
will
do
so
but
in
doing
so
must
wound
you
deeply
in
another
direction
care
nothing
so
long
as
you
clear
my
wife
everything
on
earth
is
insignificant
compared
to
that
let
me
tell
you
then
the
train
of
reasoning
which
passed
through
my
mind
in
baker
street
the
idea
of
vampire
was
to
me
absurd
such
things
do
not
happen
in
criminal
practice
in
england
and
yet
your
observation
was
precise
you
had
seen
the
lady
rise
from
beside
the
child
cot
with
the
blood
upon
her
lips
did
it
not
occur
to
you
that
bleeding
wound
may
be
sucked
for
some
other
purpose
than
to
draw
the
blood
from
it
was
there
not
queen
in
english
history
who
sucked
such
wound
to
draw
poison
from
it
poison
south
american
household
my
instinct
felt
the
presence
of
those
weapons
upon
the
wall
before
my
eyes
ever
saw
them
it
might
have
been
other
poison
but
that
was
what
occurred
to
me
when
saw
that
little
empty
quiver
beside
the
small
birdbow
it
was
just
what
expected
to
see
if
the
child
were
pricked
with
one
of
those
arrows
dipped
in
curare
or
some
other
devilish
drug
it
would
mean
death
if
the
venom
were
not
sucked
out
and
the
dog
if
one
were
to
use
such
poison
would
one
not
try
it
first
in
order
to
see
that
it
had
not
lost
its
power
did
not
foresee
the
dog
but
at
least
understand
him
and
he
fitted
into
my
reconstruction
now
do
you
understand
your
wife
feared
such
an
attack
she
saw
it
made
and
saved
the
child
life
and
yet
she
shrank
from
telling
you
all
the
truth
for
she
knew
how
you
loved
the
boy
and
feared
lest
it
break
your
heart
jacky
watched
him
as
you
fondled
the
child
just
now
his
face
was
clearly
reflected
in
the
glass
of
the
window
where
the
shutter
formed
background
saw
such
jealousy
such
cruel
hatred
as
have
seldom
seen
in
human
face
my
jacky
you
have
to
face
it
mr
ferguson
it
is
the
more
painful
because
it
is
distorted
love
maniacal
exaggerated
love
for
you
and
possibly
for
his
dead
mother
which
has
prompted
his
action
his
very
soul
is
consumed
with
hatred
for
this
splendid
child
whose
health
and
beauty
are
contrast
to
his
own
weakness
good
god
it
is
incredible
have
spoken
the
truth
madame
the
lady
was
sobbing
with
her
face
buried
in
the
pillows
now
she
turned
to
her
husband
how
could
tell
you
bob
felt
the
blow
it
would
be
to
you
it
was
better
that
should
wait
and
that
it
should
come
from
some
other
lips
than
mine
when
this
gentleman
who
seems
to
have
powers
of
magic
wrote
that
he
knew
all
was
glad
think
year
at
sea
would
be
my
prescription
for
master
jacky
said
holmes
rising
from
his
chair
only
one
thing
is
still
clouded
madame
we
can
quite
understand
your
attacks
upon
master
jacky
there
is
limit
to
mother
patience
but
how
did
you
dare
to
leave
the
child
these
last
two
days
had
told
mrs
mason
she
knew
exactly
so
imagined
ferguson
was
standing
by
the
bed
choking
his
hands
outstretched
and
quivering
this
fancy
is
the
time
for
our
exit
watson
said
holmes
in
whisper
if
you
will
take
one
elbow
of
the
too
faithful
dolores
will
take
the
other
there
now
he
added
as
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
think
we
may
leave
them
to
settle
the
rest
among
themselves
have
only
one
further
note
of
this
case
it
is
the
letter
which
holmes
wrote
in
final
answer
to
that
with
which
the
narrative
begins
it
ran
thus
baker
street
nov
21st
re
vampires
sir
referring
to
your
letter
of
the
19th
beg
to
state
that
have
looked
into
the
inquiry
of
your
client
mr
robert
ferguson
of
ferguson
and
muirhead
tea
brokers
of
mincing
lane
and
that
the
matter
has
been
brought
to
satisfactory
conclusion
with
thanks
for
your
recommendation
am
sir
faithfully
yours
sherlock
holmes
the
adventure
of
the
three
garridebs
it
may
have
been
comedy
or
it
may
have
been
tragedy
it
cost
one
man
his
reason
it
cost
me
blood
letting
and
it
cost
yet
another
man
the
penalties
of
the
law
yet
there
was
certainly
an
element
of
comedy
well
you
shall
judge
for
yourselves
remember
the
date
very
well
for
it
was
in
the
same
month
that
holmes
refused
knighthood
for
services
which
may
perhaps
some
day
be
described
only
refer
to
the
matter
in
passing
for
in
my
position
of
partner
and
confidant
am
obliged
to
be
particularly
careful
to
avoid
any
indiscretion
repeat
however
that
this
enables
me
to
fix
the
date
which
was
the
latter
end
of
june
1902
shortly
after
the
conclusion
of
the
south
african
war
holmes
had
spent
several
days
in
bed
as
was
his
habit
from
time
to
time
but
he
emerged
that
morning
with
long
foolscap
document
in
his
hand
and
twinkle
of
amusement
in
his
austere
grey
eyes
there
is
chance
for
you
to
make
some
money
friend
watson
said
he
have
you
ever
heard
the
name
of
garrideb
admitted
that
had
not
well
if
you
can
lay
your
hand
upon
garrideb
there
money
in
it
why
ah
that
long
story
rather
whimsical
one
too
don
think
in
all
our
explorations
of
human
complexities
we
have
ever
come
upon
anything
more
singular
the
fellow
will
be
here
presently
for
cross
examination
so
won
open
the
matter
up
till
he
comes
but
meanwhile
that
the
name
we
want
the
telephone
directory
lay
on
the
table
beside
me
and
turned
over
the
pages
in
rather
hopeless
quest
but
to
my
amazement
there
was
this
strange
name
in
its
due
place
gave
cry
of
triumph
here
you
are
holmes
here
it
is
holmes
took
the
book
from
my
hand
garrideb
he
read
136
little
ryder
street
sorry
to
disappoint
you
my
dear
watson
but
this
is
the
man
himself
that
is
the
address
upon
his
letter
we
want
another
to
match
him
mrs
hudson
had
come
in
with
card
upon
tray
took
it
up
and
glanced
at
it
why
here
it
is
cried
in
amazement
this
is
different
initial
john
garrideb
counsellor
at
law
moorville
kansas
holmes
smiled
as
he
looked
at
the
card
am
afraid
you
must
make
yet
another
effort
watson
said
he
this
gentleman
is
also
in
the
plot
already
though
certainly
did
not
expect
to
see
him
this
morning
however
he
is
in
position
to
tell
us
good
deal
which
want
to
know
moment
later
he
was
in
the
room
mr
john
garrideb
counsellor
at
law
was
short
powerful
man
with
the
round
fresh
clean
shaven
face
characteristic
of
so
many
american
men
of
affairs
the
general
effect
was
chubby
and
rather
childlike
so
that
one
received
the
impression
of
quite
young
man
with
broad
set
smile
upon
his
face
his
eyes
however
were
arresting
seldom
in
any
human
head
have
seen
pair
which
bespoke
more
intense
inward
life
so
bright
were
they
so
alert
so
responsive
to
every
change
of
thought
his
accent
was
american
but
was
not
accompanied
by
any
eccentricity
of
speech

mr
holmes
he
asked
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
ah
yes
your
pictures
are
not
unlike
you
sir
if
may
say
so
believe
you
have
had
letter
from
my
namesake
mr
nathan
garrideb
have
you
not
pray
sit
down
said
sherlock
holmes
we
shall
fancy
have
good
deal
to
discuss
he
took
up
his
sheets
of
foolscap
you
are
of
course
the
mr
john
garrideb
mentioned
in
this
document
but
surely
you
have
been
in
england
some
time
why
do
you
say
that
mr
holmes
seemed
to
read
sudden
suspicion
in
those
expressive
eyes
your
whole
outfit
is
english
mr
garrideb
forced
laugh
ve
read
of
your
tricks
mr
holmes
but
never
thought
would
be
the
subject
of
them
where
do
you
read
that
the
shoulder
cut
of
your
coat
the
toes
of
your
boots
could
anyone
doubt
it
well
had
no
idea
was
so
obvious
britisher
but
business
brought
me
over
here
some
time
ago
and
so
as
you
say
my
outfit
is
nearly
all
london
however
guess
your
time
is
of
value
and
we
did
not
meet
to
talk
about
the
cut
of
my
socks
what
about
getting
down
to
that
paper
you
hold
in
your
hand
holmes
had
in
some
way
ruffled
our
visitor
whose
chubby
face
had
assumed
far
less
amiable
expression
patience
mr
garrideb
said
my
friend
in
soothing
voice
dr
watson
would
tell
you
that
these
little
digressions
of
mine
sometimes
prove
in
the
end
to
have
some
bearing
on
the
matter
but
why
did
mr
nathan
garrideb
not
come
with
you
why
did
he
ever
drag
you
into
it
at
all
asked
our
visitor
with
sudden
outflame
of
anger
what
in
thunder
had
you
to
do
with
it
here
was
bit
of
professional
business
between
two
gentlemen
and
one
of
them
must
needs
call
in
detective
saw
him
this
morning
and
he
told
me
this
fool
trick
he
had
played
me
and
that
why
am
here
but
feel
bad
about
it
all
the
same
there
was
no
reflection
upon
you
mr
garrideb
it
was
simply
zeal
upon
his
part
to
gain
your
end
an
end
which
is
understand
equally
vital
for
both
of
you
he
knew
that
had
means
of
getting
information
and
therefore
it
was
very
natural
that
he
should
apply
to
me
our
visitor
angry
face
gradually
cleared
well
that
puts
it
different
said
he
when
went
to
see
him
this
morning
and
he
told
me
he
had
sent
to
detective
just
asked
for
your
address
and
came
right
away
don
want
police
butting
into
private
matter
but
if
you
are
content
just
to
help
us
find
the
man
there
can
be
no
harm
in
that
well
that
is
just
how
it
stands
said
holmes
and
now
sir
since
you
are
here
we
had
best
have
clear
account
from
your
own
lips
my
friend
here
knows
nothing
of
the
details
mr
garrideb
surveyed
me
with
not
too
friendly
gaze
need
he
know
he
asked
we
usually
work
together
well
there
no
reason
it
should
be
kept
secret
ll
give
you
the
facts
as
short
as
can
make
them
if
you
came
from
kansas
would
not
need
to
explain
to
you
who
alexander
hamilton
garrideb
was
he
made
his
money
in
real
estate
and
afterwards
in
the
wheat
pit
at
chicago
but
he
spent
it
in
buying
up
as
much
land
as
would
make
one
of
your
counties
lying
along
the
arkansas
river
west
of
fort
dodge
it
grazing
land
and
lumber
land
and
arable
land
and
mineralized
land
and
just
every
sort
of
land
that
brings
dollars
to
the
man
that
owns
it
he
had
no
kith
nor
kin
or
if
he
had
never
heard
of
it
but
he
took
kind
of
pride
in
the
queerness
of
his
name
that
was
what
brought
us
together
was
in
the
law
at
topeka
and
one
day
had
visit
from
the
old
man
and
he
was
tickled
to
death
to
meet
another
man
with
his
own
name
it
was
his
pet
fad
and
he
was
dead
set
to
find
out
if
there
were
any
more
garridebs
in
the
world
find
me
another
said
he
told
him
was
busy
man
and
could
not
spend
my
life
hiking
round
the
world
in
search
of
garridebs
none
the
less
said
he
that
is
just
what
you
will
do
if
things
pan
out
as
planned
them
thought
he
was
joking
but
there
was
powerful
lot
of
meaning
in
the
words
as
was
soon
to
discover
for
he
died
within
year
of
saying
them
and
he
left
will
behind
him
it
was
the
queerest
will
that
has
ever
been
filed
in
the
state
of
kansas
his
property
was
divided
into
three
parts
and
was
to
have
one
on
condition
that
found
two
garridebs
who
would
share
the
remainder
it
five
million
dollars
for
each
if
it
is
cent
but
we
can
lay
finger
on
it
until
we
all
three
stand
in
row
it
was
so
big
chance
that
just
let
my
legal
practice
slide
and
set
forth
looking
for
garridebs
there
is
not
one
in
the
united
states
went
through
it
sir
with
fine
toothed
comb
and
never
garrideb
could
catch
then
tried
the
old
country
sure
enough
there
was
the
name
in
the
london
telephone
directory
went
after
him
two
days
ago
and
explained
the
whole
matter
to
him
but
he
is
lone
man
like
myself
with
some
women
relations
but
no
men
it
says
three
adult
men
in
the
will
so
you
see
we
still
have
vacancy
and
if
you
can
help
to
fill
it
we
will
be
very
ready
to
pay
your
charges
well
watson
said
holmes
with
smile
said
it
was
rather
whimsical
did
not
should
have
thought
sir
that
your
obvious
way
was
to
advertise
in
the
agony
columns
of
the
papers
have
done
that
mr
holmes
no
replies
dear
me
well
it
is
certainly
most
curious
little
problem
may
take
glance
at
it
in
my
leisure
by
the
way
it
is
curious
that
you
should
have
come
from
topeka
used
to
have
correspondent
he
is
dead
now
old
dr
lysander
starr
who
was
mayor
in
1890
good
old
dr
starr
said
our
visitor
his
name
is
still
honoured
well
mr
holmes
suppose
all
we
can
do
is
to
report
to
you
and
let
you
know
how
we
progress
reckon
you
will
hear
within
day
or
two
with
this
assurance
our
american
bowed
and
departed
holmes
had
lit
his
pipe
and
he
sat
for
some
time
with
curious
smile
upon
his
face
well
asked
at
last
am
wondering
watson
just
wondering
at
what
holmes
took
his
pipe
from
his
lips
was
wondering
watson
what
on
earth
could
be
the
object
of
this
man
in
telling
us
such
rigmarole
of
lies
nearly
asked
him
so
for
there
are
times
when
brutal
frontal
attack
is
the
best
policy
but
judged
it
better
to
let
him
think
he
had
fooled
us
here
is
man
with
an
english
coat
frayed
at
the
elbow
and
trousers
bagged
at
the
knee
with
year
wear
and
yet
by
this
document
and
by
his
own
account
he
is
provincial
american
lately
landed
in
london
there
have
been
no
advertisements
in
the
agony
columns
you
know
that
miss
nothing
there
they
are
my
favourite
covert
for
putting
up
bird
and
would
never
have
overlooked
such
cock
pheasant
as
that
never
knew
dr
lysander
starr
of
topeka
touch
him
where
you
would
he
was
false
think
the
fellow
is
really
an
american
but
he
has
worn
his
accent
smooth
with
years
of
london
what
is
his
game
then
and
what
motive
lies
behind
this
preposterous
search
for
garridebs
it
worth
our
attention
for
granting
that
the
man
is
rascal
he
is
certainly
complex
and
ingenious
one
we
must
now
find
out
if
our
other
correspondent
is
fraud
also
just
ring
him
up
watson
did
so
and
heard
thin
quavering
voice
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
yes
am
mr
nathan
garrideb
is
mr
holmes
there
should
very
much
like
to
have
word
with
mr
holmes
my
friend
took
the
instrument
and
heard
the
usual
syncopated
dialogue
yes
he
has
been
here
understand
that
you
don
know
him…
how
long
only
two
days
yes
of
course
it
is
most
captivating
prospect
will
you
be
at
home
this
evening
suppose
your
namesake
will
not
be
there
very
good
we
will
come
then
for
would
rather
have
chat
without
him…
dr
watson
will
come
with
me…
understand
from
your
note
that
you
did
not
go
out
often…
well
we
shall
be
round
about
six
you
need
not
mention
it
to
the
american
lawyer…
very
good
bye
it
was
twilight
of
lovely
spring
evening
and
even
little
ryder
street
one
of
the
smaller
offshoots
from
the
edgware
road
within
stone
cast
of
old
tyburn
tree
of
evil
memory
looked
golden
and
wonderful
in
the
slanting
rays
of
the
setting
sun
the
particular
house
to
which
we
were
directed
was
large
old
fashioned
early
georgian
edifice
with
flat
brick
face
broken
only
by
two
deep
bay
windows
on
the
ground
floor
it
was
on
this
ground
floor
that
our
client
lived
and
indeed
the
low
windows
proved
to
be
the
front
of
the
huge
room
in
which
he
spent
his
waking
hours
holmes
pointed
as
we
passed
to
the
small
brass
plate
which
bore
the
curious
name
up
some
years
watson
he
remarked
indicating
its
discoloured
surface
it
his
real
name
anyhow
and
that
is
something
to
note
the
house
had
common
stair
and
there
were
number
of
names
painted
in
the
hall
some
indicating
offices
and
some
private
chambers
it
was
not
collection
of
residential
flats
but
rather
the
abode
of
bohemian
bachelors
our
client
opened
the
door
for
us
himself
and
apologized
by
saying
that
the
woman
in
charge
left
at
four
clock
mr
nathan
garrideb
proved
to
be
very
tall
loosejointed
round
backed
person
gaunt
and
bald
some
sixty
odd
years
of
age
he
had
cadaverous
face
with
the
dull
dead
skin
of
man
to
whom
exercise
was
unknown
large
round
spectacles
and
small
projecting
goat
beard
combined
with
his
stooping
attitude
to
give
him
an
expression
of
peering
curiosity
the
general
effect
however
was
amiable
though
eccentric

the
room
was
as
curious
as
its
occupant
it
looked
like
small
museum
it
was
both
broad
and
deep
with
cupboards
and
cabinets
all
round
crowded
with
specimens
geological
and
anatomical
cases
of
butterflies
and
moths
flanked
each
side
of
the
entrance
large
table
in
the
centre
was
littered
with
all
sorts
of
debris
while
the
tall
brass
tube
of
powerful
microscope
bristled
up
among
them
as
glanced
round
was
surprised
at
the
universality
of
the
man
interests
here
was
case
of
ancient
coins
there
was
cabinet
of
flint
instruments
behind
his
central
table
was
large
cupboard
of
fossil
bones
above
was
line
of
plaster
skulls
with
such
names
as
neanderthal
heidelberg
cro
magnon
printed
beneath
them
it
was
clear
that
he
was
student
of
many
subjects
as
he
stood
in
front
of
us
now
he
held
piece
of
chamois
leather
in
his
right
hand
with
which
he
was
polishing
coin
syracusan
of
the
best
period
he
explained
holding
it
up
they
degenerated
greatly
towards
the
end
at
their
best
hold
them
supreme
though
some
prefer
the
alexandrian
school
you
will
find
chair
here
mr
holmes
pray
allow
me
to
clear
these
bones
and
you
sir
ah
yes
dr
watson
if
you
would
have
the
goodness
to
put
the
japanese
vase
to
one
side
you
see
round
me
my
little
interests
in
life
my
doctor
lectures
me
about
never
going
out
but
why
should
go
out
when
have
so
much
to
hold
me
here
can
assure
you
that
the
adequate
cataloguing
of
one
of
those
cabinets
would
take
me
three
good
months
holmes
looked
round
him
with
curiosity
but
do
you
tell
me
that
you
never
go
out
he
said
now
and
again
drive
down
to
sotheby
or
christie
otherwise
very
seldom
leave
my
room
am
not
too
strong
and
my
researches
are
very
absorbing
but
you
can
imagine
mr
holmes
what
terrific
shock
pleasant
but
terrific
it
was
for
me
when
heard
of
this
unparalleled
good
fortune
it
only
needs
one
more
garrideb
to
complete
the
matter
and
surely
we
can
find
one
had
brother
but
he
is
dead
and
female
relatives
are
disqualified
but
there
must
surely
be
others
in
the
world
had
heard
that
you
handled
strange
cases
and
that
was
why
sent
to
you
of
course
this
american
gentleman
is
quite
right
and
should
have
taken
his
advice
first
but
acted
for
the
best
think
you
acted
very
wisely
indeed
said
holmes
but
are
you
really
anxious
to
acquire
an
estate
in
america
certainly
not
sir
nothing
would
induce
me
to
leave
my
collection
but
this
gentleman
has
assured
me
that
he
will
buy
me
out
as
soon
as
we
have
established
our
claim
five
million
dollars
was
the
sum
named
there
are
dozen
specimens
in
the
market
at
the
present
moment
which
fill
gaps
in
my
collection
and
which
am
unable
to
purchase
for
want
of
few
hundred
pounds
just
think
what
could
do
with
five
million
dollars
why
have
the
nucleus
of
national
collection
shall
be
the
hans
sloane
of
my
age
his
eyes
gleamed
behind
his
great
spectacles
it
was
very
clear
that
no
pains
would
be
spared
by
mr
nathan
garrideb
in
finding
namesake
merely
called
to
make
your
acquaintance
and
there
is
no
reason
why
should
interrupt
your
studies
said
holmes
prefer
to
establish
personal
touch
with
those
with
whom
do
business
there
are
few
questions
need
ask
for
have
your
very
clear
narrative
in
my
pocket
and
filled
up
the
blanks
when
this
american
gentleman
called
understand
that
up
to
this
week
you
were
unaware
of
his
existence
that
is
so
he
called
last
tuesday
did
he
tell
you
of
our
interview
to
day
yes
he
came
straight
back
to
me
he
had
been
very
angry
why
should
he
be
angry
he
seemed
to
think
it
was
some
reflection
on
his
honour
but
he
was
quite
cheerful
again
when
he
returned
did
he
suggest
any
course
of
action
no
sir
he
did
not
has
he
had
or
asked
for
any
money
from
you
no
sir
never
you
see
no
possible
object
he
has
in
view
none
except
what
he
states
did
you
tell
him
of
our
telephone
appointment
yes
sir
did
holmes
was
lost
in
thought
could
see
that
he
was
puzzled
have
you
any
articles
of
great
value
in
your
collection
no
sir
am
not
rich
man
it
is
good
collection
but
not
very
valuable
one
you
have
no
fear
of
burglars
not
the
least
how
long
have
you
been
in
these
rooms
nearly
five
years
holmes
cross
examination
was
interrupted
by
an
imperative
knocking
at
the
door
no
sooner
had
our
client
unlatched
it
than
the
american
lawyer
burst
excitedly
into
the
room
here
you
are
he
cried
waving
paper
over
his
head
thought
should
be
in
time
to
get
you
mr
nathan
garrideb
my
congratulations
you
are
rich
man
sir
our
business
is
happily
finished
and
all
is
well
as
to
you
mr
holmes
we
can
only
say
we
are
sorry
if
we
have
given
you
any
useless
trouble
he
handed
over
the
paper
to
our
client
who
stood
staring
at
marked
advertisement
holmes
and
leaned
forward
and
read
it
over
his
shoulder

gasped
our
host
that
makes
our
third
man
had
opened
up
inquiries
in
birmingham
said
the
american
and
my
agent
there
has
sent
me
this
advertisement
from
local
paper
we
must
hustle
and
put
the
thing
through
have
written
to
this
man
and
told
him
that
you
will
see
him
in
his
office
to
morrow
afternoon
at
four
clock
you
want
me
to
see
him
what
do
you
say
mr
holmes
don
you
think
it
would
be
wiser
here
am
wandering
american
with
wonderful
tale
why
should
he
believe
what
tell
him
but
you
are
britisher
with
solid
references
and
he
is
bound
to
take
notice
of
what
you
say
would
go
with
you
if
you
wished
but
have
very
busy
day
to
morrow
and
could
always
follow
you
if
you
are
in
any
trouble
well
have
not
made
such
journey
for
years
it
is
nothing
mr
garrideb
have
figured
out
our
connections
you
leave
at
twelve
and
should
be
there
soon
after
two
then
you
can
be
back
the
same
night
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
see
this
man
explain
the
matter
and
get
an
affidavit
of
his
existence
by
the
lord
he
added
hotly
considering
ve
come
all
the
way
from
the
centre
of
america
it
is
surely
little
enough
if
you
go
hundred
miles
in
order
to
put
this
matter
through
quite
so
said
holmes
think
what
this
gentleman
says
is
very
true
mr
nathan
garrideb
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
disconsolate
air
well
if
you
insist
shall
go
said
he
it
is
certainly
hard
for
me
to
refuse
you
anything
considering
the
glory
of
hope
that
you
have
brought
into
my
life
then
that
is
agreed
said
holmes
and
no
doubt
you
will
let
me
have
report
as
soon
as
you
can
ll
see
to
that
said
the
american
well
he
added
looking
at
his
watch
ll
have
to
get
on
ll
call
to
morrow
mr
nathan
and
see
you
off
to
birmingham
coming
my
way
mr
holmes
well
then
good
bye
and
we
may
have
good
news
for
you
to
morrow
night
noticed
that
my
friend
face
cleared
when
the
american
left
the
room
and
the
look
of
thoughtful
perplexity
had
vanished
wish
could
look
over
your
collection
mr
garrideb
said
he
in
my
profession
all
sorts
of
odd
knowledge
comes
useful
and
this
room
of
yours
is
storehouse
of
it
our
client
shone
with
pleasure
and
his
eyes
gleamed
from
behind
his
big
glasses
had
always
heard
sir
that
you
were
very
intelligent
man
said
he
could
take
you
round
now
if
you
have
the
time
unfortunately
have
not
but
these
specimens
are
so
well
labelled
and
classified
that
they
hardly
need
your
personal
explanation
if
should
be
able
to
look
in
to
morrow
presume
that
there
would
be
no
objection
to
my
glancing
over
them
none
at
all
you
are
most
welcome
the
place
will
of
course
be
shut
up
but
mrs
saunders
is
in
the
basement
up
to
four
clock
and
would
let
you
in
with
her
key
well
happen
to
be
clear
to
morrow
afternoon
if
you
would
say
word
to
mrs
saunders
it
would
be
quite
in
order
by
the
way
who
is
your
house
agent
our
client
was
amazed
at
the
sudden
question
holloway
and
steele
in
the
edgware
road
but
why
am
bit
of
an
archaeologist
myself
when
it
comes
to
houses
said
holmes
laughing
was
wondering
if
this
was
queen
anne
or
georgian
beyond
doubt
really
should
have
thought
little
earlier
however
it
is
easily
ascertained
well
good
bye
mr
garrideb
and
may
you
have
every
success
in
your
birmingham
journey

the
house
agent
was
close
by
but
we
found
that
it
was
closed
for
the
day
so
we
made
our
way
back
to
baker
street
it
was
not
till
after
dinner
that
holmes
reverted
to
the
subject
our
little
problem
draws
to
close
said
he
no
doubt
you
have
outlined
the
solution
in
your
own
mind
can
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
it
the
head
is
surely
clear
enough
and
the
tail
we
should
see
to
morrow
did
you
notice
nothing
curious
about
that
advertisement
saw
that
the
word
plough
was
misspelt
oh
you
did
notice
that
did
you
come
watson
you
improve
all
the
time
yes
it
was
bad
english
but
good
american
the
printer
had
set
it
up
as
received
then
the
buckboards
that
is
american
also
and
artesian
wells
are
commoner
with
them
than
with
us
it
was
typical
american
advertisement
but
purporting
to
be
from
an
english
firm
what
do
you
make
of
that
can
only
suppose
that
this
american
lawyer
put
it
in
himself
what
his
object
was
fail
to
understand
well
there
are
alternative
explanations
anyhow
he
wanted
to
get
this
good
old
fossil
up
to
birmingham
that
is
very
clear
might
have
told
him
that
he
was
clearly
going
on
wild
goose
chase
but
on
second
thoughts
it
seemed
better
to
clear
the
stage
by
letting
him
go
to
morrow
watson
well
to
morrow
will
speak
for
itself
holmes
was
up
and
out
early
when
he
returned
at
lunchtime
noticed
that
his
face
was
very
grave
this
is
more
serious
matter
than
had
expected
watson
said
he
it
is
fair
to
tell
you
so
though
know
it
will
only
be
an
additional
reason
to
you
for
running
your
head
into
danger
should
know
my
watson
by
now
but
there
is
danger
and
you
should
know
it
well
it
is
not
the
first
we
have
shared
holmes
hope
it
may
not
be
the
last
what
is
the
particular
danger
this
time
we
are
up
against
very
hard
case
have
identified
mr
john
garrideb
counsellor
at
law
he
is
none
other
than
killer
evans
of
sinister
and
murderous
reputation
fear
am
none
the
wiser
ah
it
is
not
part
of
your
profession
to
carry
about
portable
newgate
calendar
in
your
memory
have
been
down
to
see
friend
lestrade
at
the
yard
there
may
be
an
occasional
want
of
imaginative
intuition
down
there
but
they
lead
the
world
for
thoroughness
and
method
had
an
idea
that
we
might
get
on
the
track
of
our
american
friend
in
their
records
sure
enough
found
his
chubby
face
smiling
up
at
me
from
the
rogues
portrait
gallery
james
winter
alias
morecroft
alias
killer
evans
was
the
inscription
below
holmes
drew
an
envelope
from
his
pocket
scribbled
down
few
points
from
his
dossier
aged
forty
four
native
of
chicago
known
to
have
shot
three
men
in
the
states
escaped
from
penitentiary
through
political
influence
came
to
london
in
1893
shot
man
over
cards
in
night
club
in
the
waterloo
road
in
january
1895
man
died
but
he
was
shown
to
have
been
the
aggressor
in
the
row
dead
man
was
identified
as
rodger
prescott
famous
as
forger
and
coiner
in
chicago
killer
evans
released
in
1901
has
been
under
police
supervision
since
but
so
far
as
known
has
led
an
honest
life
very
dangerous
man
usually
carries
arms
and
is
prepared
to
use
them
that
is
our
bird
watson
sporting
bird
as
you
must
admit
but
what
is
his
game
well
it
begins
to
define
itself
have
been
to
the
houseagent
our
client
as
he
told
us
has
been
there
five
years
it
was
unlet
for
year
before
then
the
previous
tenant
was
gentleman
at
large
named
waldron
appearance
was
well
remembered
at
the
office
he
had
suddenly
vanished
and
nothing
more
been
heard
of
him
he
was
tall
bearded
man
with
very
dark
features
now
prescott
the
man
whom
killer
evans
had
shot
was
according
to
scotland
yard
tall
dark
man
with
beard
as
working
hypothesis
think
we
may
take
it
that
prescott
the
american
criminal
used
to
live
in
the
very
room
which
our
innocent
friend
now
devotes
to
his
museum
so
at
last
we
get
link
you
see
and
the
next
link
well
we
must
go
now
and
look
for
that
he
took
revolver
from
the
drawer
and
handed
it
to
me
have
my
old
favourite
with
me
if
our
wild
west
friend
tries
to
live
up
to
his
nickname
we
must
be
ready
for
him
ll
give
you
an
hour
for
siesta
watson
and
then
think
it
will
be
time
for
our
ryder
street
adventure
it
was
just
four
clock
when
we
reached
the
curious
apartment
of
nathan
garrideb
mrs
saunders
the
caretaker
was
about
to
leave
but
she
had
no
hesitation
in
admitting
us
for
the
door
shut
with
spring
lock
and
holmes
promised
to
see
that
all
was
safe
before
we
left
shortly
afterwards
the
outer
door
closed
her
bonnet
passed
the
bow
window
and
we
knew
that
we
were
alone
in
the
lower
floor
of
the
house
holmes
made
rapid
examination
of
the
premises
there
was
one
cupboard
in
dark
corner
which
stood
out
little
from
the
wall
it
was
behind
this
that
we
eventually
crouched
while
holmes
in
whisper
outlined
his
intentions
he
wanted
to
get
our
amiable
friend
out
of
his
room
that
is
very
clear
and
as
the
collector
never
went
out
it
took
some
planning
to
do
it
the
whole
of
this
garrideb
invention
was
apparently
for
no
other
end
must
say
watson
that
there
is
certain
devilish
ingenuity
about
it
even
if
the
queer
name
of
the
tenant
did
give
him
an
opening
which
he
could
hardly
have
expected
he
wove
his
plot
with
remarkable
cunning
but
what
did
he
want
well
that
is
what
we
are
here
to
find
out
it
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
our
client
so
far
as
can
read
the
situation
it
is
something
connected
with
the
man
he
murdered
the
man
who
may
have
been
his
confederate
in
crime
there
is
some
guilty
secret
in
the
room
that
is
how
read
it
at
first
thought
our
friend
might
have
something
in
his
collection
more
valuable
than
he
knew
something
worth
the
attention
of
big
criminal
but
the
fact
that
rodger
prescott
of
evil
memory
inhabited
these
rooms
points
to
some
deeper
reason
well
watson
we
can
but
possess
our
souls
in
patience
and
see
what
the
hour
may
bring
that
hour
was
not
long
in
striking
we
crouched
closer
in
the
shadow
as
we
heard
the
outer
door
open
and
shut
then
came
the
sharp
metallic
snap
of
key
and
the
american
was
in
the
room
he
closed
the
door
softly
behind
him
took
sharp
glance
around
him
to
see
that
all
was
safe
threw
off
his
overcoat
and
walked
up
to
the
central
table
with
the
brisk
manner
of
one
who
knows
exactly
what
he
has
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
he
pushed
the
table
to
one
side
tore
up
the
square
of
carpet
on
which
it
rested
rolled
it
completely
back
and
then
drawing
jemmy
from
his
inside
pocket
he
knelt
down
and
worked
vigorously
upon
the
floor
presently
we
heard
the
sound
of
sliding
boards
and
an
instant
later
square
had
opened
in
the
planks
killer
evans
struck
match
lit
stump
of
candle
and
vanished
from
our
view
clearly
our
moment
had
come
holmes
touched
my
wrist
as
signal
and
together
we
stole
across
to
the
open
trap
door
gently
as
we
moved
however
the
old
floor
must
have
creaked
under
our
feet
for
the
head
of
our
american
peering
anxiously
round
emerged
suddenly
from
the
open
space
his
face
turned
upon
us
with
glare
of
baffled
rage
which
gradually
softened
into
rather
shamefaced
grin
as
he
realized
that
two
pistols
were
pointed
at
his
head
well
said
he
coolly
as
he
scrambled
to
the
surface
guess
you
have
been
one
too
many
for
me
mr
holmes
saw
through
my
game
suppose
and
played
me
for
sucker
from
the
first
well
sir
hand
it
to
you
have
me
beat
and—
in
an
instant
he
had
whisked
out
revolver
from
his
breast
and
had
fired
two
shots
felt
sudden
hot
sear
as
if
red
hot
iron
had
been
pressed
to
my
thigh
there
was
crash
as
holmes
pistol
came
down
on
the
man
head
had
vision
of
him
sprawling
upon
the
floor
with
blood
running
down
his
face
while
holmes
rummaged
him
for
weapons
then
my
friend
wiry
arms
were
round
me
and
he
was
leading
me
to
chair
you
re
not
hurt
watson
for
god
sake
say
that
you
are
not
hurt
it
was
worth
wound
it
was
worth
many
wounds
to
know
the
depth
of
loyalty
and
love
which
lay
behind
that
cold
mask
the
clear
hard
eyes
were
dimmed
for
moment
and
the
firm
lips
were
shaking
for
the
one
and
only
time
caught
glimpse
of
great
heart
as
well
as
of
great
brain
all
my
years
of
humble
but
single
minded
service
culminated
in
that
moment
of
revelation
it
nothing
holmes
it
mere
scratch
he
had
ripped
up
my
trousers
with
his
pocket
knife
you
are
right
he
cried
with
an
immense
sigh
of
relief
it
is
quite
superficial
his
face
set
like
flint
as
he
glared
at
our
prisoner
who
was
sitting
up
with
dazed
face
by
the
lord
it
is
as
well
for
you
if
you
had
killed
watson
you
would
not
have
got
out
of
this
room
alive
now
sir
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
he
had
nothing
to
say
for
himself
he
only
sat
and
scowled
leaned
on
holmes
arm
and
together
we
looked
down
into
the
small
cellar
which
had
been
disclosed
by
the
secret
flap
it
was
still
illuminated
by
the
candle
which
evans
had
taken
down
with
him
our
eyes
fell
upon
mass
of
rusted
machinery
great
rolls
of
paper
litter
of
bottles
and
neatly
arranged
upon
small
table
number
of
neat
little
bundles

counterfeiter
outfit
said
holmes
yes
sir
said
our
prisoner
staggering
slowly
to
his
feet
and
then
sinking
into
the
chair
the
greatest
counterfeiter
london
ever
saw
that
prescott
machine
and
those
bundles
on
the
table
are
two
thousand
of
prescott
notes
worth
hundred
each
and
fit
to
pass
anywhere
help
yourselves
gentlemen
call
it
deal
and
let
me
beat
it
holmes
laughed
we
don
do
things
like
that
mr
evans
there
is
no
bolthole
for
you
in
this
country
you
shot
this
man
prescott
did
you
not
yes
sir
and
got
five
years
for
it
though
it
was
he
who
pulled
on
me
five
years
when
should
have
had
medal
the
size
of
soup
plate
no
living
man
could
tell
prescott
from
bank
of
england
and
if
hadn
put
him
out
he
would
have
flooded
london
with
them
was
the
only
one
in
the
world
who
knew
where
he
made
them
can
you
wonder
that
wanted
to
get
to
the
place
and
can
you
wonder
that
when
found
this
crazy
boob
of
bug
hunter
with
the
queer
name
squatting
right
on
the
top
of
it
and
never
quitting
his
room
had
to
do
the
best
could
to
shift
him
maybe
would
have
been
wiser
if
had
put
him
away
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
but
soft
hearted
guy
that
can
begin
shooting
unless
the
other
man
has
gun
also
but
say
mr
holmes
what
have
done
wrong
anyhow
ve
not
used
this
plant
ve
not
hurt
this
old
stiff
where
do
you
get
me
only
attempted
murder
so
far
as
can
see
said
holmes
but
that
not
our
job
they
take
that
at
the
next
stage
what
we
wanted
at
present
was
just
your
sweet
self
please
give
the
yard
call
watson
it
won
be
entirely
unexpected
so
those
were
the
facts
about
killer
evans
and
his
remarkable
invention
of
the
three
garridebs
we
heard
later
that
our
poor
old
friend
never
got
over
the
shock
of
his
dissipated
dreams
when
his
castle
in
the
air
fell
down
it
buried
him
beneath
the
ruins
he
was
last
heard
of
at
nursing
home
in
brixton
it
was
glad
day
at
the
yard
when
the
prescott
outfit
was
discovered
for
though
they
knew
that
it
existed
they
had
never
been
able
after
the
death
of
the
man
to
find
out
where
it
was
evans
had
indeed
done
great
service
and
caused
several
worthy
men
to
sleep
the
sounder
for
the
counterfeiter
stands
in
class
by
himself
as
public
danger
they
would
willingly
have
subscribed
to
that
soup
plate
medal
of
which
the
criminal
had
spoken
but
an
unappreciative
bench
took
less
favourable
view
and
the
killer
returned
to
those
shades
from
which
he
had
just
emerged
vi
the
adventure
of
the
illustrious
client
it
can
hurt
now
was
mr
sherlock
holmes
comment
when
for
the
tenth
time
in
as
many
years
asked
his
leave
to
reveal
the
following
narrative
so
it
was
that
at
last
obtained
permission
to
put
on
record
what
was
in
some
ways
the
supreme
moment
of
my
friend
career
both
holmes
and
had
weakness
for
the
turkish
bath
it
was
over
smoke
in
the
pleasant
lassitude
of
the
drying
room
that
have
found
him
less
reticent
and
more
human
than
anywhere
else
on
the
upper
floor
of
the
northumberland
avenue
establishment
there
is
an
isolated
corner
where
two
couches
lie
side
by
side
and
it
was
on
these
that
we
lay
upon
september
1902
the
day
when
my
narrative
begins
had
asked
him
whether
anything
was
stirring
and
for
answer
he
had
shot
his
long
thin
nervous
arm
out
of
the
sheets
which
enveloped
him
and
had
drawn
an
envelope
from
the
inside
pocket
of
the
coat
which
hung
beside
him
it
may
be
some
fussy
self
important
fool
it
may
be
matter
of
life
or
death
said
he
as
he
handed
me
the
note
know
no
more
than
this
message
tells
me
it
was
from
the
carlton
club
and
dated
the
evening
before
this
is
what
read
sir
james
damery
presents
his
compliments
to
mr
sherlock
holmes
and
will
call
upon
him
at
30
to
morrow
sir
james
begs
to
say
that
the
matter
upon
which
he
desires
to
consult
mr
holmes
is
very
delicate
and
also
very
important
he
trusts
therefore
that
mr
holmes
will
make
every
effort
to
grant
this
interview
and
that
he
will
confirm
it
over
the
telephone
to
the
carlton
club
need
not
say
that
have
confirmed
it
watson
said
holmes
as
returned
the
paper
do
you
know
anything
of
this
man
damery
only
that
this
name
is
household
word
in
society
well
can
tell
you
little
more
than
that
he
has
rather
reputation
for
arranging
delicate
matters
which
are
to
be
kept
out
of
the
papers
you
may
remember
his
negotiations
with
sir
george
lewis
over
the
hammerford
will
case
he
is
man
of
the
world
with
natural
turn
for
diplomacy
am
bound
therefore
to
hope
that
it
is
not
false
scent
and
that
he
has
some
real
need
for
our
assistance
our
well
if
you
will
be
so
good
watson
shall
be
honoured
then
you
have
the
hour—4
30
until
then
we
can
put
the
matter
out
of
our
heads
was
living
in
my
own
rooms
in
queen
anne
street
at
the
time
but
was
round
at
baker
street
before
the
time
named
sharp
to
the
half
hour
colonel
sir
james
damery
was
announced
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
describe
him
for
many
will
remember
that
large
bluff
honest
personality
that
broad
cleanshaven
face
and
above
all
that
pleasant
mellow
voice
frankness
shone
from
his
grey
irish
eyes
and
good
humour
played
round
his
mobile
smiling
lips
his
lucent
top
hat
his
dark
frock
coat
indeed
every
detail
from
the
pearl
pin
in
the
black
satin
cravat
to
the
lavender
spats
over
the
varnished
shoes
spoke
of
the
meticulous
care
in
dress
for
which
he
was
famous
the
big
masterful
aristocrat
dominated
the
little
room
of
course
was
prepared
to
find
dr
watson
he
remarked
with
courteous
bow
his
collaboration
may
be
very
necessary
for
we
are
dealing
on
this
occasion
mr
holmes
with
man
to
whom
violence
is
familiar
and
who
will
literally
stick
at
nothing
should
say
that
there
is
no
more
dangerous
man
in
europe
have
had
several
opponents
to
whom
that
flattering
term
has
been
applied
said
holmes
with
smile
don
you
smoke
then
you
will
excuse
me
if
light
my
pipe
if
your
man
is
more
dangerous
than
the
late
professor
moriarty
or
than
the
living
colonel
sebastian
moran
then
he
is
indeed
worth
meeting
may
ask
his
name
have
you
ever
heard
of
baron
gruner
you
mean
the
austrian
murderer
colonel
damery
threw
up
his
kid
gloved
hands
with
laugh
there
is
no
getting
past
you
mr
holmes
wonderful
so
you
have
already
sized
him
up
as
murderer
it
is
my
business
to
follow
the
details
of
continental
crime
who
could
possibly
have
read
what
happened
at
prague
and
have
any
doubts
as
to
the
man
guilt
it
was
purely
technical
legal
point
and
the
suspicious
death
of
witness
that
saved
him
am
as
sure
that
he
killed
his
wife
when
the
socalled
accident
happened
in
the
splugen
pass
as
if
had
seen
him
do
it
knew
also
that
he
had
come
to
england
and
had
presentiment
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
find
me
some
work
to
do
well
what
has
baron
gruner
been
up
to
presume
it
is
not
this
old
tragedy
which
has
come
up
again
no
it
is
more
serious
than
that
to
revenge
crime
is
important
but
to
prevent
it
is
more
so
it
is
terrible
thing
mr
holmes
to
see
dreadful
event
an
atrocious
situation
preparing
itself
before
your
eyes
to
clearly
understand
whither
it
will
lead
and
yet
to
be
utterly
unable
to
avert
it
can
human
being
be
placed
in
more
trying
position
perhaps
not
then
you
will
sympathize
with
the
client
in
whose
interests
am
acting
did
not
understand
that
you
were
merely
an
intermediary
who
is
the
principal
mr
holmes
must
beg
you
not
to
press
that
question
it
is
important
that
should
be
able
to
assure
him
that
his
honoured
name
has
been
in
no
way
dragged
into
the
matter
his
motives
are
to
the
last
degree
honourable
and
chivalrous
but
he
prefers
to
remain
unknown
need
not
say
that
your
fees
will
be
assured
and
that
you
will
be
given
perfectly
free
hand
surely
the
actual
name
of
your
client
is
immaterial
am
sorry
said
holmes
am
accustomed
to
have
mystery
at
one
end
of
my
cases
but
to
have
it
at
both
ends
is
too
confusing
fear
sir
james
that
must
decline
to
act
our
visitor
was
greatly
disturbed
his
large
sensitive
face
was
darkened
with
emotion
and
disappointment
you
hardly
realize
the
effect
of
your
own
action
mr
holmes
said
he
you
place
me
in
most
serious
dilemma
for
am
perfectly
certain
that
you
would
be
proud
to
take
over
the
case
if
could
give
you
the
facts
and
yet
promise
forbids
me
from
revealing
them
all
may
at
least
lay
all
that
can
before
you
by
all
means
so
long
as
it
is
understood
that
commit
myself
to
nothing
that
is
understood
in
the
first
place
you
have
no
doubt
heard
of
general
de
merville
страница

de
merville
of
khyber
fame
yes
have
heard
of
him
he
has
daughter
violet
de
merville
young
rich
beautiful
accomplished
wonder
woman
in
every
way
it
is
this
daughter
this
lovely
innocent
girl
whom
we
are
endeavouring
to
save
from
the
clutches
of
fiend
baron
gruner
has
some
hold
over
her
then
the
strongest
of
all
holds
where
woman
is
concerned
the
hold
of
love
the
fellow
is
as
you
may
have
heard
extraordinarily
handsome
with
most
fascinating
manner
gentle
voice
and
that
air
of
romance
and
mystery
which
means
so
much
to
woman
he
is
said
to
have
the
whole
sex
at
his
mercy
and
to
have
made
ample
use
of
the
fact
but
how
came
such
man
to
meet
lady
of
the
standing
of
miss
violet
de
merville
it
was
on
mediterranean
yachting
voyage
the
company
though
select
paid
their
own
passages
no
doubt
the
promoters
hardly
realized
the
baron
true
character
until
it
was
too
late
the
villain
attached
himself
to
the
lady
and
with
such
effect
that
he
has
completely
and
absolutely
won
her
heart
to
say
that
she
loves
him
hardly
expresses
it
she
dotes
upon
him
she
is
obsessed
by
him
outside
of
him
there
is
nothing
on
earth
she
will
not
hear
one
word
against
him
everything
has
been
done
to
cure
her
of
her
madness
but
in
vain
to
sum
up
she
proposes
to
marry
him
next
month
as
she
is
of
age
and
has
will
of
iron
it
is
hard
to
know
how
to
prevent
her
does
she
know
about
the
austrian
episode
the
cunning
devil
has
told
her
every
unsavoury
public
scandal
of
his
past
life
but
always
in
such
way
as
to
make
himself
out
to
be
an
innocent
martyr
she
absolutely
accepts
his
version
and
will
listen
to
no
other
dear
me
but
surely
you
have
inadvertently
let
out
the
name
of
your
client
it
is
no
doubt
general
de
merville
our
visitor
fidgeted
in
his
chair
could
deceive
you
by
saying
so
mr
holmes
but
it
would
not
be
true
de
merville
is
broken
man
the
strong
soldier
has
been
utterly
demoralized
by
this
incident
he
has
lost
the
nerve
which
never
failed
him
on
the
battlefield
and
has
become
weak
doddering
old
man
utterly
incapable
of
contending
with
brilliant
forceful
rascal
like
this
austrian
my
client
however
is
an
old
friend
one
who
has
known
the
general
intimately
for
many
years
and
taken
paternal
interest
in
this
young
girl
since
she
wore
short
frocks
he
cannot
see
this
tragedy
consummated
without
some
attempt
to
stop
it
there
is
nothing
in
which
scotland
yard
can
act
it
was
his
own
suggestion
that
you
should
be
called
in
but
it
was
as
have
said
on
the
express
stipulation
that
he
should
not
be
personally
involved
in
the
matter
have
no
doubt
mr
holmes
with
your
great
powers
you
could
easily
trace
my
client
back
through
me
but
must
ask
you
as
point
of
honour
to
refrain
from
doing
so
and
not
to
break
in
upon
his

holmes
noted
it
down
and
sat
still
smiling
with
the
open
memorandum
book
upon
his
knee
the
baron
present
address
please
vernon
lodge
near
kingston
it
is
large
house
he
has
been
fortunate
in
some
rather
shady
speculations
and
is
rich
man
which
naturally
makes
him
more
dangerous
antagonist
is
he
at
home
at
present
yes
apart
from
what
you
have
told
me
can
you
give
me
any
further
information
about
the
man
he
has
expensive
tastes
he
is
horse
fancier
for
short
time
he
played
polo
at
hurlingham
but
then
this
prague
affair
got
noised
about
and
he
had
to
leave
he
collects
books
and
pictures
he
is
man
with
considerable
artistic
side
to
his
nature
he
is
believe
recognized
authority
upon
chinese
pottery
and
has
written
book
upon
the
subject
complex
mind
said
holmes
all
great
criminals
have
that
my
old
friend
charlie
peace
was
violin
virtuoso
wainwright
was
no
mean
artist
could
quote
many
more
well
sir
james
you
will
inform
your
client
that
am
turning
my
mind
upon
baron
gruner
can
say
no
more
have
some
sources
of
information
of
my
own
and
dare
say
we
may
find
some
means
of
opening
the
matter
up
when
our
visitor
had
left
us
holmes
sat
so
long
in
deep
thought
that
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
had
forgotten
my
presence
at
last
however
he
came
briskly
back
to
earth
well
watson
any
views
he
asked
should
think
you
had
better
see
the
young
lady
herself
my
dear
watson
if
her
poor
old
broken
father
cannot
move
her
how
shall
stranger
prevail
and
yet
there
is
something
in
the
suggestion
if
all
else
fails
but
think
we
must
begin
from
different
angle
rather
fancy
that
shinwell
johnson
might
be
help
have
not
had
occasion
to
mention
shinwell
johnson
in
these
memoirs
because
have
seldom
drawn
my
cases
from
the
latter
phases
of
my
friend
career
during
the
first
years
of
the
century
he
became
valuable
assistant
johnson
grieve
to
say
made
his
name
first
as
very
dangerous
villain
and
served
two
terms
at
parkhurst
finally
he
repented
and
allied
himself
to
holmes
acting
as
his
agent
in
the
huge
criminal
underworld
of
london
and
obtaining
information
which
often
proved
to
be
of
vital
importance
had
johnson
been
nark
of
the
police
he
would
soon
have
been
exposed
but
as
he
dealt
with
cases
which
never
came
directly
into
the
courts
his
activities
were
never
realized
by
his
companions
with
the
glamour
of
his
two
convictions
upon
him
he
had
the
entree
of
every
night
club
doss
house
and
gamblingden
in
the
town
and
his
quick
observation
and
active
brain
made
him
an
ideal
agent
for
gaining
information
it
was
to
him
that
sherlock
holmes
now
proposed
to
turn
it
was
not
possible
for
me
to
follow
the
immediate
steps
taken
by
my
friend
for
had
some
pressing
professional
business
of
my
own
but
met
him
by
appointment
that
evening
at
simpson
where
sitting
at
small
table
in
the
front
window
and
looking
down
at
the
rushing
stream
of
life
in
the
strand
he
told
me
something
of
what
had
passed
johnson
is
on
the
prowl
said
he
may
pick
up
some
garbage
in
the
darker
recesses
of
the
underworld
for
it
is
down
there
amid
the
black
roots
of
crime
that
we
must
hunt
for
this
man
secrets
but
if
the
lady
will
not
accept
what
is
already
known
why
should
any
fresh
discovery
of
yours
turn
her
from
her
purpose
who
knows
watson
woman
heart
and
mind
are
insoluble
puzzles
to
the
male
murder
might
be
condoned
or
explained
and
yet
some
smaller
offence
might
rankle
baron
gruner
remarked
to
me—
he
remarked
to
you
oh
to
be
sure
had
not
told
you
of
my
plans
well
watson
love
to
come
to
close
grips
with
my
man
like
to
meet
him
eye
to
eye
and
read
for
myself
the
stuff
that
he
is
made
of
when
had
given
johnson
his
instructions
took
cab
out
to
kingston
and
found
the
baron
in
most
affable
mood
did
he
recognize
you
there
was
no
difficulty
about
that
for
simply
sent
in
my
card
he
is
an
excellent
antagonist
cool
as
ice
silky
voiced
and
soothing
as
one
of
your
fashionable
consultants
and
poisonous
as
cobra
he
has
breeding
in
him
real
aristocrat
of
crime
with
superficial
suggestion
of
afternoon
tea
and
all
the
cruelty
of
the
grave
behind
it
yes
am
glad
to
have
had
my
attention
called
to
baron
adelbert
gruner
you
say
he
was
affable
purring
cat
who
thinks
he
sees
prospective
mice
some
people
affability
is
more
deadly
than
the
violence
of
coarser
souls
his
greeting
was
characteristic
rather
thought
should
see
you
sooner
or
later
mr
holmes
said
he
you
have
been
engaged
no
doubt
by
general
de
merville
to
endeavour
to
stop
my
marriage
with
his
daughter
violet
that
is
so
is
it
not
acquiesced
my
dear
man
said
he
you
will
only
ruin
your
own
well
deserved
reputation
it
is
not
case
in
which
you
can
possibly
succeed
you
will
have
barren
work
to
say
nothing
of
incurring
some
danger
let
me
very
strongly
advise
you
to
draw
off
at
once
it
is
curious
answered
but
that
was
the
very
advice
which
had
intended
to
give
you
have
respect
for
your
brains
baron
and
the
little
which
have
seen
of
your
personality
has
not
lessened
it
let
me
put
it
to
you
as
man
to
man
no
one
wants
to
rake
up
your
past
and
make
you
unduly
uncomfortable
it
is
over
and
you
are
now
in
smooth
waters
but
if
you
persist
in
this
marriage
you
will
raise
up
swarm
of
powerful
enemies
who
will
never
leave
you
alone
until
they
have
made
england
too
hot
to
hold
you
is
the
game
worth
it
surely
you
would
be
wiser
if
you
left
the
lady
alone
it
would
not
be
pleasant
for
you
if
these
facts
of
your
past
were
brought
to
her
notice

the
baron
has
little
waxed
tips
of
hair
under
his
nose
like
the
short
antennae
of
an
insect
these
quivered
with
amusement
as
he
listened
and
he
finally
broke
into
gentle
chuckle
excuse
my
amusement
mr
holmes
said
he
but
it
is
really
funny
to
see
you
trying
to
play
hand
with
no
cards
in
it
don
think
anyone
could
do
it
better
but
it
is
rather
pathetic
all
the
same
not
colour
card
there
mr
holmes
nothing
but
the
smallest
of
the
small
so
you
think
so
know
let
me
make
the
thing
clear
to
you
for
my
own
hand
is
so
strong
that
can
afford
to
show
it
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
win
the
entire
affection
of
this
lady
this
was
given
to
me
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
told
her
very
clearly
of
all
the
unhappy
incidents
in
my
past
life
also
told
her
that
certain
wicked
and
designing
persons
hope
you
recognize
yourself
would
come
to
her
and
tell
her
these
things
and
warned
her
how
to
treat
them
you
have
heard
of
post
hypnotic
suggestion
mr
holmes
well
you
will
see
how
it
works
for
man
of
personality
can
use
hypnotism
without
any
vulgar
passes
or
tomfoolery
so
she
is
ready
for
you
and
have
no
doubt
would
give
you
an
appointment
for
she
is
quite
amenable
to
her
father
will
save
only
in
the
one
little
matter
well
watson
there
seemed
to
be
no
more
to
say
so
took
my
leave
with
as
much
cold
dignity
as
could
summon
but
as
had
my
hand
on
the
door
handle
he
stopped
me
by
the
way
mr
holmes
said
he
did
you
know
le
brun
the
french
agent
yes
said
do
you
know
what
befell
him
heard
that
he
was
beaten
by
some
apaches
in
the
montmartre
district
and
crippled
for
life
quite
true
mr
holmes
by
curious
coincidence
he
had
been
inquiring
into
my
affairs
only
week
before
don
do
it
mr
holmes
it
not
lucky
thing
to
do
several
have
found
that
out
my
last
word
to
you
is
go
your
own
way
and
let
me
go
mine
good
bye
so
there
you
are
watson
you
are
up
to
date
now
the
fellow
seems
dangerous
mighty
dangerous
disregard
the
blusterer
but
this
is
the
sort
of
man
who
says
rather
less
than
he
means
must
you
interfere
does
it
really
matter
if
he
marries
the
girl
considering
that
he
undoubtedly
murdered
his
last
wife
should
say
it
mattered
very
much
besides
the
client
well
we
need
not
discuss
that
when
you
have
finished
your
coffee
you
had
best
come
home
with
me
for
the
blithe
shinwell
will
be
there
with
his
report
we
found
him
sure
enough
huge
coarse
red
faced
scorbutic
man
with
pair
of
vivid
black
eyes
which
were
the
only
external
sign
of
the
very
cunning
mind
within
it
seems
that
he
had
dived
down
into
what
was
peculiarly
his
kingdom
and
beside
him
on
the
settee
was
brand
which
he
had
brought
up
in
the
shape
of
slim
flame
like
young
woman
with
pale
intense
face
youthful
and
yet
so
worn
with
sin
and
sorrow
that
one
read
the
terrible
years
which
had
left
their
leprous
mark
upon
her
this
is
miss
kitty
winter
said
shinwell
johnson
waving
his
fat
hand
as
an
introduction
what
she
don
know
well
there
she
ll
speak
for
herself
put
my
hand
right
on
her
mr
holmes
within
an
hour
of
your
message
easy
to
find
said
the
young
woman
hell
london
gets
me
every
time
same
address
for
porky
shinwell
we
re
old
mates
porky
you
and
but
by
cripes
there
is
another
who
ought
to
be
down
in
lower
hell
than
we
if
there
was
any
justice
in
the
world
that
is
the
man
you
are
after
mr
holmes
smiled
gather
we
have
your
good
wishes
miss
winter
if
can
help
to
put
him
where
he
belongs
yours
to
the
rattle
said
our
visitor
with
fierce
energy
there
was
an
intensity
of
hatred
in
her
white
set
face
and
her
blazing
eyes
such
as
woman
seldom
and
man
never
can
attain
you
needn
go
into
my
past
mr
holmes
that
neither
here
nor
there
but
what
am
adelbert
gruner
made
me
if
could
pull
him
down
she
clutched
frantically
with
her
hands
into
the
air
oh
if
could
only
pull
him
into
the
pit
where
he
has
pushed
so
many
you
know
how
the
matter
stands
porky
shinwell
has
been
telling
me
he
after
some
other
poor
fool
and
wants
to
marry
her
this
time
you
want
to
stop
it
well
you
surely
know
enough
about
this
devil
to
prevent
any
decent
girl
in
her
senses
wanting
to
be
in
the
same
parish
with
him
she
is
not
in
her
senses
she
is
madly
in
love
she
has
been
told
all
about
him
she
cares
nothing
told
about
the
murder
yes
my
lord
she
must
have
nerve
she
puts
them
all
down
as
slanders
couldn
you
lay
proofs
before
her
silly
eyes
well
can
you
help
us
do
so
ain
proof
myself
if
stood
before
her
and
told
her
how
he
used
me—
would
you
do
this
would
not
well
it
might
be
worth
trying
but
he
has
told
her
most
of
his
sins
and
had
pardon
from
her
and
understand
she
will
not
reopen
the
question
ll
lay
he
didn
tell
her
all
said
miss
winter
caught
glimpse
of
one
or
two
murders
besides
the
one
that
made
such
fuss
he
would
speak
of
someone
in
his
velvet
way
and
then
look
at
me
with
steady
eye
and
say
he
died
within
month
it
wasn
hot
air
either
but
took
little
notice
you
see
loved
him
myself
at
that
time
whatever
he
did
went
with
me
same
as
with
this
poor
fool
there
was
just
one
thing
that
shook
me
yes
by
cripes
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
poisonous
lying
tongue
that
explains
and
soothes
have
left
him
that
very
night
it
book
he
has
brown
leather
book
with
lock
and
his
arms
in
gold
on
the
outside
think
he
was
bit
drunk
that
night
or
he
would
not
have
shown
it
to
me
what
was
it
then
tell
you
mr
holmes
this
man
collects
women
and
takes
pride
in
his
collection
as
some
men
collect
moths
or
butterflies
he
had
it
all
in
that
book
snapshot
photographs
names
details
everything
about
them
it
was
beastly
book
no
man
even
if
he
had
come
from
the
gutter
could
have
put
together
but
it
was
adelbert
gruner
book
all
the
same
souls
have
ruined
he
could
have
put
that
on
the
outside
if
he
had
been
so
minded
however
that
neither
here
nor
there
for
the
book
would
not
serve
you
and
if
it
would
you
can
get
it
where
is
it
how
can
tell
you
where
it
is
now
it
more
than
year
since
left
him
know
where
he
kept
it
then
he
precise
tidy
cat
of
man
in
many
of
his
ways
so
maybe
it
is
still
in
the
pigeon
hole
of
the
old
bureau
in
the
inner
study
do
you
know
his
house
ve
been
in
the
study
said
holmes
have
you
though
you
haven
been
slow
on
the
job
if
you
only
started
this
morning
maybe
dear
adelbert
has
met
his
match
this
time
the
outer
study
is
the
one
with
the
chinese
crockery
in
it
big
glass
cupboard
between
the
windows
then
behind
his
desk
is
the
door
that
leads
to
the
inner
study
small
room
where
he
keeps
papers
and
things
is
he
not
afraid
of
burglars
adelbert
is
no
coward
his
worst
enemy
couldn
say
that
of
him
he
can
look
after
himself
there
burglar
alarm
at
night
besides
what
is
there
for
burglar
unless
they
got
away
with
all
this
fancy
crockery
no
good
said
shinwell
johnson
with
the
decided
voice
of
the
expert
no
fence
wants
stuff
of
that
sort
that
you
can
neither
melt
nor
sell
quite
so
said
holmes
well
now
miss
winter
if
you
would
call
here
tomorrow
evening
at
five
would
consider
in
the
meanwhile
whether
your
suggestion
of
seeing
this
lady
personally
may
not
be
arranged
am
exceedingly
obliged
to
you
for
your
cooperation
need
not
say
that
my
clients
will
consider
liberally—
none
of
that
mr
holmes
cried
the
young
woman
am
not
out
for
money
let
me
see
this
man
in
the
mud
and
ve
got
all
ve
worked
for
in
the
mud
with
my
foot
on
his
cursed
face
that
my
price
with
you
tomorrow
or
any
other
day
so
long
as
you
are
on
his
track
porky
here
can
tell
you
always
where
to
find
me
did
not
see
holmes
again
until
the
following
evening
when
we
dined
once
more
at
our
strand
restaurant
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
asked
him
what
luck
he
had
in
his
interview
then
he
told
the
story
which
would
repeat
in
this
way
his
hard
dry
statement
needs
some
little
editing
to
soften
it
into
the
terms
of
real
life
there
was
no
difficulty
at
all
about
the
appointment
said
holmes
for
the
girl
glories
in
showing
abject
filial
obedience
in
all
secondary
things
in
an
attempt
to
atone
for
her
flagrant
breach
of
it
in
her
engagement
the
general
phoned
that
all
was
ready
and
the
fiery
miss
turned
up
according
to
schedule
so
that
at
half
past
five
cab
deposited
us
outside
104
berkeley
square
where
the
old
soldier
resides
one
of
those
awful
grey
london
castles
which
would
make
church
seem
frivolous
footman
showed
us
into
great
yellow
curtained
drawing
room
and
there
was
the
lady
awaiting
us
demure
pale
self
contained
as
inflexible
and
remote
as
snow

on
mountain

don
quite
know
how
to
make
her
clear
to
you
watson
perhaps
you
may
meet
her
before
we
are
through
and
you
can
use
your
own
gift
of
words
she
is
beautiful
but
with
the
ethereal
other
world
beauty
of
some
fanatic
whose
thoughts
are
set
on
high
have
seen
such
faces
in
the
pictures
of
the
old
masters
of
the
middle
ages
how
beastman
could
have
laid
his
vile
paws
upon
such
being
of
the
beyond
cannot
imagine
you
may
have
noticed
how
extremes
call
to
each
other
the
spiritual
to
the
animal
the
cave
man
to
the
angel
you
never
saw
worse
case
than
this
she
knew
what
we
had
come
for
of
course
that
villain
had
lost
no
time
in
poisoning
her
mind
against
us
miss
winter
advent
rather
amazed
her
think
but
she
waved
us
into
our
respective
chairs
like
reverend
abbess
receiving
two
rather
leprous
mendicants
if
your
head
is
inclined
to
swell
my
dear
watson
take
course
of
miss
violet
de
merville
well
sir
said
she
in
voice
like
the
wind
from
an
iceberg
your
name
is
familiar
to
me
you
have
called
as
understand
to
malign
my
fiance
baron
gruner
it
is
only
by
my
father
request
that
see
you
at
all
and
warn
you
in
advance
that
anything
you
can
say
could
not
possibly
have
the
slightest
effect
upon
my
mind
was
sorry
for
her
watson
thought
of
her
for
the
moment
as
would
have
thought
of
daughter
of
my
own
am
not
often
eloquent
use
my
head
not
my
heart
but
really
did
plead
with
her
with
all
the
warmth
of
words
that
could
find
in
my
nature
pictured
to
her
the
awful
position
of
the
woman
who
only
wakes
to
man
character
after
she
is
his
wife
woman
who
has
to
submit
to
be
caressed
by
bloody
hands
and
lecherous
lips
spared
her
nothing
the
shame
the
fear
the
agony
the
hopelessness
of
it
all
my
hot
words
could
not
bring
one
tinge
of
colour
to
those
ivory
cheeks
or
one
gleam
of
emotion
to
those
abstracted
eyes
thought
of
what
the
rascal
had
said
about
post
hypnotic
influence
one
could
really
believe
that
she
was
living
above
the
earth
in
some
ecstatic
dream
yet
there
was
nothing
indefinite
in
her
replies
have
listened
to
you
with
patience
mr
holmes
said
she
the
effect
upon
my
mind
is
exactly
as
predicted
am
aware
that
adelbert
that
my
fiance
has
had
stormy
life
in
which
he
has
incurred
bitter
hatreds
and
most
unjust
aspersions
you
are
only
the
last
of
series
who
have
brought
their
slanders
before
me
possibly
you
mean
well
though
learn
that
you
are
paid
agent
who
would
have
been
equally
willing
to
act
for
the
baron
as
against
him
but
in
any
case
wish
you
to
understand
once
for
all
that
love
him
and
that
he
loves
me
and
that
the
opinion
of
all
the
world
is
no
more
to
me
than
the
twitter
of
those
birds
outside
the
window
if
his
noble
nature
has
ever
for
an
instant
fallen
it
may
be
that
have
been
specially
sent
to
raise
it
to
its
true
and
lofty
level
am
not
clear
—here
she
turned
eyes
upon
my
companion—
who
this
young
lady
may
be
was
about
to
answer
when
the
girl
broke
in
like
whirlwind
if
ever
you
saw
flame
and
ice
face
to
face
it
was
those
two
women
ll
tell
you
who
am
she
cried
springing
out
of
her
chair
her
mouth
all
twisted
with
passion—
am
his
last
mistress
am
one
of
hundred
that
he
has
tempted
and
used
and
ruined
and
thrown
into
the
refuse
heap
as
he
will
you
also
your
refuse
heap
is
more
likely
to
be
grave
and
maybe
that
the
best
tell
you
foolish
woman
if
you
marry
this
man
he
ll
be
the
death
of
you
it
may
be
broken
heart
or
it
may
be
broken
neck
but
he
ll
have
you
one
way
or
the
other
it
not
out
of
love
for
you
speaking
don
care
tinker
curse
whether
you
live
or
die
it
out
of
hate
for
him
and
to
spite
him
and
to
get
back
on
him
for
what
he
did
to
me
but
it
all
the
same
and
you
needn
look
at
me
like
that
my
fine
lady
for
you
may
be
lower
than
am
before
you
are
through
with
it
should
prefer
not
to
discuss
such
matters
said
miss
de
merville
coldly
let
me
say
once
for
all
that
am
aware
of
three
passages
in
my
fiance
life
in
which
he
became
entangled
with
designing
women
and
that
am
assured
of
his
hearty
repentance
for
any
evil
that
he
may
have
done
three
passages
screamed
my
companion
you
fool
you
unutterable
fool
mr
holmes
beg
that
you
will
bring
this
interview
to
an
end
said
the
icy
voice
have
obeyed
my
father
wish
in
seeing
you
but
am
not
compelled
to
listen
to
the
ravings
of
this
person
with
an
oath
miss
winter
darted
forward
and
if
had
not
caught
her
wrist
she
would
have
clutched
this
maddening
woman
by
the
hair
dragged
her
towards
the
door
and
was
lucky
to
get
her
back
into
the
cab
without
public
scene
for
she
was
beside
herself
with
rage
in
cold
way
felt
pretty
furious
myself
watson
for
there
was
something
indescribably
annoying
in
the
calm
aloofness
and
supreme
self
complaisance
of
the
woman
whom
we
were
trying
to
save
so
now
once
again
you
know
exactly
how
we
stand
and
it
is
clear
that
must
plan
some
fresh
opening
move
for
this
gambit
won
work
ll
keep
in
touch
with
you
watson
for
it
is
more
than
likely
that
you
will
have
your
part
to
play
though
it
is
just
possible
that
the
next
move
may
lie
with
them
rather
than
with
us
and
it
did
their
blow
fell
or
his
blow
rather
for
never
could
believe
that
the
lady
was
privy
to
it
think
could
show
you
the
very
paving
stone
upon
which
stood
when
my
eyes
fell
upon
the
placard
and
pang
of
horror
passed
through
my
very
soul
it
was
between
the
grand
hotel
and
charing
cross
station
where
one
legged
news
vender
displayed
his
evening
papers
the
date
was
just
two
days
after
the
last
conversation
there
black
upon
yellow
was
the
terrible
news
sheet
murderous
attack
upon
sherlock
holmes
think
stood
stunned
for
some
moments
then
have
confused
recollection
of
snatching
at
paper
of
the
remonstrance
of
the
man
whom
had
not
paid
and
finally
of
standing
in
the
doorway
of
chemist
shop
while
turned
up
the
fateful
paragraph
this
was
how
it
ran
we
learn
with
regret
that
mr
sherlock
holmes
the
well
known
private
detective
was
the
victim
this
morning
of
murderous
assault
which
has
left
him
in
precarious
position
there
are
no
exact
details
to
hand
but
the
event
seems
to
have
occurred
about
twelve
clock
in
regent
street
outside
the
cafe
royal
the
attack
was
made
by
two
men
armed
with
sticks
and
mr
holmes
was
beaten
about
the
head
and
body
receiving
injuries
which
the
doctors
describe
as
most
serious
he
was
carried
to
charing
cross
hospital
and
afterwards
insisted
upon
being
taken
to
his
rooms
in
baker
street
the
miscreants
who
attacked
him
appear
to
have
been
respectably
dressed
men
who
escaped
from
the
bystanders
by
passing
through
the
cafe
royal
and
out
into
glasshouse
street
behind
it
no
doubt
they
belonged
to
that
criminal
fraternity
which
has
so
often
had
occasion
to
bewail
the
activity
and
ingenuity
of
the
injured
man
need
not
say
that
my
eyes
had
hardly
glanced
over
the
paragraph
before
had
sprung
into
hansom
and
was
on
my
way
to
baker
street
found
sir
leslie
oakshott
the
famous
surgeon
in
the
hall
and
his
brougham
waiting
at
the
curb
no
immediate
danger
was
his
report
two
lacerated
scalp
wounds
and
some
considerable
bruises
several
stitches
have
been
necessary
morphine
has
been
injected
and
quiet
is
essential
but
an
interview
of
few
minutes
would
not
be
absolutely
forbidden
with
this
permission
stole
into
the
darkened
room
the
sufferer
was
wide
awake
and
heard
my
name
in
hoarse
whisper
the
blind
was
three
quarters
down
but
one
ray
of
sunlight
slanted
through
and
struck
the
bandaged
head
of
the
injured
man
crimson
patch
had
soaked
through
the
white
linen
compress
sat
beside
him
and
bent
my
head
all
right
watson
don
look
so
scared
he
muttered
in
very
weak
voice
it
not
as
bad
as
it
seems
thank
god
for
that
bit
of
single
stick
expert
as
you
know
took
most
of
them
on
my
guard
it
was
the
second
man
that
was
too
much
for
me
what
can
do
holmes
of
course
it
was
that
damned
fellow
who
set
them
on
ll
go
and
thrash
the
hide
off
him
if
you
give
the
word
good
old
watson
no
we
can
do
nothing
there
unless
the
police
lay
their
hands
on
the
men
but
their
get
away
had
been
well
prepared
we
may
be
sure
of
that
wait
little
have
my
plans
the
first
thing
is
to
exaggerate
my
injuries
they
ll
come
to
you
for
news
put
it
on
thick
watson
lucky
if
live
the
week
out
concussion
delirium
what
you
like
you
can
overdo
it
but
sir
leslie
oakshott
oh
he
all
right
he
shall
see
the
worst
side
of
me
ll
look
after
that
anything
else
yes
tell
shinwell
johnson
to
get
that
girl
out
of
the
way
those
beauties
will
be
after
her
now
they
know
of
course
that
she
was
with
me
in
the
case
if
they
dared
to
do
me
in
it
is
not
likely
they
will
neglect
her
that
is
urgent
do
it
to
night

ll
go
now
anything
more
put
my
pipe
on
the
table
and
the
tobacco
slipper
right
come
in
each
morning
and
we
will
plan
our
campaign
arranged
with
johnson
that
evening
to
take
miss
winter
to
quiet
suburb
and
see
that
she
lay
low
until
the
danger
was
past
for
six
days
the
public
were
under
the
impression
that
holmes
was
at
the
door
of
death
the
bulletins
were
very
grave
and
there
were
sinister
paragraphs
in
the
papers
my
continual
visits
assured
me
that
it
was
not
so
bad
as
that
his
wiry
constitution
and
his
determined
will
were
working
wonders
he
was
recovering
fast
and
had
suspicions
at
times
that
he
was
really
finding
himself
faster
than
he
pretended
even
to
me
there
was
curious
secretive
streak
in
the
man
which
led
to
many
dramatic
effects
but
left
even
his
closest
friend
guessing
as
to
what
his
exact
plans
might
be
he
pushed
to
an
extreme
the
axiom
that
the
only
safe
plotter
was
he
who
plotted
alone
was
nearer
him
than
anyone
else
and
yet
was
always
conscious
of
the
gap
between
on
the
seventh
day
the
stitches
were
taken
out
in
spite
of
which
there
was
report
of
erysipelas
in
the
evening
papers
the
same
evening
papers
had
an
announcement
which
was
bound
sick
or
well
to
carry
to
my
friend
it
was
simply
that
among
the
passengers
on
the
cunard
boat
ruritania
starting
from
liverpool
on
friday
was
the
baron
adelbert
gruner
who
had
some
important
financial
business
to
settle
in
the
states
before
his
impending
wedding
to
miss
violet
de
merville
only
daughter
of
etc
holmes
listened
to
the
news
with
cold
concentrated
look
upon
his
pale
face
which
told
me
that
it
hit
him
hard
friday
he
cried
only
three
clear
days
believe
the
rascal
wants
to
put
himself
out
of
danger
way
but
he
won
watson
by
the
lord
harry
he
won
now
watson
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
am
here
to
be
used
holmes
well
then
spend
the
next
twenty
four
hours
in
an
intensive
study
of
chinese
pottery
he
gave
no
explanations
and
asked
for
none
by
long
experience
had
learned
the
wisdom
of
obedience
but
when
had
left
his
room
walked
down
baker
street
revolving
in
my
head
how
on
earth
was
to
carry
out
so
strange
an
order
finally
drove
to
the
london
library
in
st
james
square
put
the
matter
to
my
friend
lomax
the
sublibrarian
and
departed
to
my
rooms
with
goodly
volume
under
my
arm
it
is
said
that
the
barrister
who
crams
up
case
with
such
care
that
he
can
examine
an
expert
witness
upon
the
monday
has
forgotten
all
his
forced
knowledge
before
the
saturday
certainly
should
not
like
now
to
pose
as
an
authority
upon
ceramics
and
yet
all
that
evening
and
all
that
night
with
short
interval
for
rest
and
all
next
morning
was
sucking
in
knowledge
and
committing
names
to
memory
there
learned
of
the
hall
marks
of
the
great
artist
decorators
of
the
mystery
of
cyclical
dates
the
marks
of
the
hung
wu
and
the
beauties
of
the
yung
lo
the
writings
of
tang
ying
and
the
glories
of
the
primitive
period
of
the
sung
and
the
yuan
was
charged
with
all
this
information
when
called
upon
holmes
next
evening
he
was
out
of
bed
now
though
you
would
not
have
guessed
it
from
the
published
reports
and
he
sat
with
his
much
bandaged
head
resting
upon
his
hand
in
the
depth
of
his
favourite
armchair
why
holmes
said
if
one
believed
the
papers
you
are
dying
that
said
he
is
the
very
impression
which
intended
to
convey
and
now
watson
have
you
learned
your
lessons
at
least
have
tried
to
good
you
could
keep
up
an
intelligent
conversation
on
the
subject
believe
could
then
hand
me
that
little
box
from
the
mantelpiece
he
opened
the
lid
and
took
out
small
object
most
carefully
wrapped
in
some
fine
eastern
silk
this
he
unfolded
and
disclosed
delicate
little
saucer
of
the
most
beautiful
deep
blue
colour
it
needs
careful
handling
watson
this
is
the
real
egg
shell
pottery
of
the
ming
dynasty
no
finer
piece
ever
passed
through
christie
complete
set
of
this
would
be
worth
king
ransom
in
fact
it
is
doubtful
if
there
is
complete
set
outside
the
imperial
palace
of
peking
the
sight
of
this
would
drive
real
connoisseur
wild
what
am
to
do
with
it
holmes
handed
me
card
upon
which
was
printed
dr
hill
barton
369
half
moon
street
that
is
your
name
for
the
evening
watson
you
will
call
upon
baron
gruner
know
something
of
his
habits
and
at
half
past
eight
he
would
probably
be
disengaged
note
will
tell
him
in
advance
that
you
are
about
to
call
and
you
will
say
that
you
are
bringing
him
specimen
of
an
absolutely
unique
set
of
ming
china
you
may
as
well
be
medical
man
since
that
is
part
which
you
can
play
without
duplicity
you
are
collector
this
set
has
come
your
way
you
have
heard
of
the
baron
interest
in
the
subject
and
you
are
not
averse
to
selling
at
price
what
price
well
asked
watson
you
would
certainly
fall
down
badly
if
you
did
not
know
the
value
of
your
own
wares
this
saucer
was
got
for
me
by
sir
james
and
comes
understand
from
the
collection
of
his
client
you
will
not
exaggerate
if
you
say
that
it
could
hardly
be
matched
in
the
world
could
perhaps
suggest
that
the
set
should
be
valued
by
an
expert
excellent
watson
you
scintillate
to
day
suggest
christie
or
sotheby
your
delicacy
prevents
your
putting
price
for
yourself
but
if
he
won
see
me
oh
yes
he
will
see
you
he
has
the
collection
mania
in
its
most
acute
form
and
especially
on
this
subject
on
which
he
is
an
acknowledged
authority
sit
down
watson
and
will
dictate
the
letter
no
answer
needed
you
will
merely
say
that
you
are
coming
and
why
it
was
an
admirable
document
short
courteous
and
stimulating
to
the
curiosity
of
the
connoisseur
district
messenger
was
duly
dispatched
with
it
on
the
same
evening
with
the
precious
saucer
in
my
hand
and
the
card
of
dr
hill
barton
in
my
pocket
set
off
on
my
own
adventure
the
beautiful
house
and
grounds
indicated
that
baron
gruner
was
as
sir
james
had
said
man
of
considerable
wealth
long
winding
drive
with
banks
of
rare
shrubs
on
either
side
opened
out
into
great
gravelled
square
adorned
with
statues
the
place
had
been
built
by
south
african
gold
king
in
the
days
of
the
great
boom
and
the
long
low
house
with
the
turrets
at
the
corners
though
an
architectural
nightmare
was
imposing
in
its
size
and
solidity
butler
who
would
have
adorned
bench
of
bishops
showed
me
in
and
handed
me
over
to
plush
clad
footman
who
ushered
me
into
the
baron
presence
he
was
standing
at
the
open
front
of
great
case
which
stood
between
the
windows
and
which
contained
part
of
his
chinese
collection
he
turned
as
entered
with
small
brown
vase
in
his
hand
pray
sit
down
doctor
said
he
was
looking
over
my
own
treasures
and
wondering
whether
could
really
afford
to
add
to
them
this
little
tang
specimen
which
dates
from
the
seventh
century
would
probably
interest
you
am
sure
you
never
saw
finer
workmanship
or
richer
glaze
have
you
the
ming
saucer
with
you
of
which
you
spoke
carefully
unpacked
it
and
handed
it
to
him
he
seated
himself
at
his
desk
pulled
over
the
lamp
for
it
was
growing
dark
and
set
himself
to
examine
it
as
he
did
so
the
yellow
light
beat
upon
his
own
features
and
was
able
to
study
them
at
my
ease
he
was
certainly
remarkably
handsome
man
his
european
reputation
for
beauty
was
fully
deserved
in
figure
he
was
not
more
than
of
middle
size
but
was
built
upon
graceful
and
active
lines
his
face
was
swarthy
almost
oriental
with
large
dark
languorous
eyes
which
might
easily
hold
an
irresistible
fascination
for
women
his
hair
and
moustache
were
raven
black
the
latter
short
pointed
and
carefully
waxed
his
features
were
regular
and
pleasing
save
only
his
straight
thin
lipped
mouth
if
ever
saw
murderer
mouth
it
was
there
cruel
hard
gash
in
the
face
compressed
inexorable
and
terrible
he
was
ill
advised
to
train
his
moustache
away
from
it
for
it
was
nature
danger
signal
set
as
warning
to
his
victims
his
voice
was
engaging
and
his
manners
perfect
in
age
should
have
put
him
at
little
over
thirty
though
his
record
afterwards
showed
that
he
was
forty
two
very
fine
very
fine
indeed
he
said
at
last
and
you
say
you
have
set
of
six
to
correspond
what
puzzles
me
is
that
should
not
have
heard
of
such
magnificent
specimens
only
know
of
one
in
england
to
match
this
and
it
is
certainly
not
likely
to
be
in
the
market
would
it
be
indiscreet
if
were
to
ask
you
dr
hill
barton
how
you
obtained
this
does
it
really
matter
asked
with
as
careless
an
air
as
could
muster
you
can
see
that
the
piece
is
genuine
and
as
to
the
value
am
content
to
take
an
expert
valuation
very
mysterious
said
he
with
quick
suspicious
flash
of
his
dark
eyes
in
dealing
with
objects
of
such
value
one
naturally
wishes
to
know
all
about
the
transaction
that
the
piece
is
genuine
is
certain
have
no
doubts
at
all
about
that
but
suppose
am
bound
to
take
every
possibility
into
account
that
it
should
prove
afterwards
that
you
had
no
right
to
sell

would
guarantee
you
against
any
claim
of
the
son
that
of
course
would
open
up
the
question
as
to
what
your
guarantee
was
worth
my
bankers
would
answer
that
quite
so
and
yet
the
whole
transaction
strikes
me
as
rather
unusual
you
can
do
business
or
not
said
with
indifference
have
given
you
the
first
offer
as
understood
that
you
were
connoisseur
but
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
other
quaerers
who
told
you
was
connoisseur
was
aware
that
you
had
written
book
upon
the
subject
have
you
read
the
book
no
dear
me
this
becomes
more
and
more
difficult
for
me
to
understand
you
are
connoisseur
and
collector
with
very
valuable
piece
in
your
collection
and
yet
you
have
never
troubled
to
consult
the
one
book
which
would
have
told
you
of
the
real
meaning
and
value
of
what
you
held
how
do
you
explain
that
am
very
busy
man
am
doctor
in
practice
that
is
no
answer
if
man
has
hobby
he
follows
it
up
whatever
his
other
pursuits
may
be
you
said
in
your
note
that
you
were
connoisseur
so
am
might
ask
you
few
questions
to
test
you
am
obliged
to
tell
you
doctor
if
you
are
indeed
doctor
that
the
incident
becomes
more
and
more
suspicious
would
ask
you
what
do
you
know
of
the
emperor
shomu
and
how
do
you
associate
him
with
the
shoso
in
near
nara
dear
me
does
that
puzzle
you
tell
me
little
about
the
nonhern
wei
dynasty
and
its
place
in
the
history
of
ceramics
sprang
from
my
chair
in
simulated
anger
this
is
intolerable
sir
said
came
here
to
do
you
favour
and
not
to
be
examined
as
if
were
schoolboy
my
knowledge
on
these
subjects
may
be
second
only
to
your
own
but
certainly
shall
not
answer
questions
which
have
been
put
in
so
offensive
way
he
looked
at
me
steadily
the
languor
had
gone
from
his
eyes
they
suddenly
glared
there
was
gleam
of
teeth
from
between
those
cruel
lips
what
is
the
game
you
are
here
as
spy
you
are
an
emissary
of
holmes
this
is
trick
that
you
are
playing
upon
me
the
fellow
is
dying
hear
so
he
sends
his
tools
to
keep
watch
upon
me
you
ve
made
your
way
in
here
without
leave
and
by
god
you
may
find
it
harder
to
get
out
than
to
get
in
he
had
sprung
to
his
feet
and
stepped
back
bracing
myself
for
an
attack
for
the
man
was
beside
himself
with
rage
he
may
have
suspected
me
from
the
first
certainly
this
cross
examination
had
shown
him
the
truth
but
it
was
clear
that
could
not
hope
to
deceive
him
he
dived
his
hand
into
side
drawer
and
rummaged
furiously
then
something
struck
upon
his
ear
for
he
stood
listening
intently
ah
he
cried
ah
and
dashed
into
the
room
behind
him
two
steps
took
me
to
the
open
door
and
my
mind
will
ever
carry
clear
picture
of
the
scene
within
the
window
leading
out
to
the
garden
was
wide
open
beside
it
looking
like
some
terrible
ghost
his
head
gin
with
bloody
bandages
his
face
drawn
and
white
stood
sherlock
holmes
the
next
instant
he
was
through
the
gap
and
heard
the
crash
of
his
body
among
the
laurel
bushes
outside
with
howl
of
rage
the
master
of
the
house
rushed
after
him
to
the
open
window
and
then
it
was
done
in
an
instant
and
yet
clearly
saw
it
an
arm
woman
arm
shot
out
from
among
the
leaves
at
the
same
instant
the
baron
uttered
horrible
cry
yell
which
will
always
ring
in
my
memory
he
clapped
his
two
hands
to
his
face
and
rushed
round
the
room
beating
his
head
horribly
against
the
walls
then
he
fell
upon
the
carpet
rolling
and
writhing
while
scream
after
scream
resounded
through
the
house
water
for
god
sake
water
was
his
cry
seized
carafe
from
side
table
and
rushed
to
his
aid
at
the
same
moment
the
butler
and
several
footmen
ran
in
from
the
hall
remember
that
one
of
them
fainted
as
knelt
by
the
injured
man
and
turned
that
awful
face
to
the
light
of
the
lamp
the
vitriol
was
eating
into
it
everywhere
and
dripping
from
the
ears
and
the
chin
one
eye
was
already
white
and
glazed
the
other
was
red
and
inflamed
the
features
which
had
admired
few
minutes
before
were
now
like
some
beautiful
painting
over
which
the
artist
has
passed
wet
and
foul
sponge
they
were
blurred
discoloured
inhuman
terrible
in
few
words
explained
exactly
what
had
occurred
so
far
as
the
vitriol
attack
was
concerned
some
had
climbed
through
the
window
and
others
had
rushed
out
on
to
the
lawn
but
it
was
dark
and
it
had
begun
to
rain
between
his
screams
the
victim
raged
and
raved
against
the
avenger
it
was
that
hell
cat
kitty
winter
he
cried
oh
the
she
devil
she
shall
pay
for
it
she
shall
pay
oh
god
in
heaven
this
pain
is
more
than
can
bear
bathed
his
face
in
oil
put
cotton
wadding
on
the
raw
surfaces
and
administered
hypodermic
of
morphia
all
suspicion
of
me
had
passed
from
his
mind
in
the
presence
of
this
shock
and
he
clung
to
my
hands
as
if
might
have
the
power
even
yet
to
clear
those
dead
fish
eyes
which
glazed
up
at
me
could
have
wept
over
the
ruin
had
not
remembered
very
clearly
the
vile
life
which
had
led
up
to
so
hideous
change
it
was
loathsome
to
feel
the
pawing
of
his
burning
hands
and
was
relieved
when
his
family
surgeon
closely
followed
by
specialist
came
to
relieve
me
of
my
charge
an
inspector
of
police
had
also
arrived
and
to
him
handed
my
real
card
it
would
have
been
useless
as
well
as
foolish
to
do
otherwise
for
was
nearly
as
well
known
by
sight
at
the
yard
as
holmes
himself
then
left
that
house
of
gloom
and
terror
within
an
hour
was
at
baker
street
holmes
was
seated
in
his
familiar
chair
looking
very
pale
and
exhausted
apart
from
his
injuries
even
his
iron
nerves
had
been
shocked
by
the
events
of
the
evening
and
he
listened
with
horror
to
my
account
of
the
baron
transformation
the
wages
of
sin
watson
the
wages
of
sin
said
he
sooner
or
later
it
will
always
come
god
knows
there
was
sin
enough
he
added
taking
up
brown
volume
from
the
table
here
is
the
book
the
woman
talked
of
if
this
will
not
break
off
the
marriage
nothing
ever
could
but
it
will
watson
it
must
no
self
respecting
woman
could
stand
it
is
his
love
diary
or
his
lust
diary
call
it
what
you
will
the
moment
the
woman
told
us
of
it
realized
what
tremendous
weapon
was
there
if
we
could
but
lay
our
hands
on
it
said
nothing
at
the
time
to
indicate
my
thoughts
for
this
woman
might
have
given
it
away
but
brooded
over
it
then
this
assault
upon
me
gave
me
the
chance
of
letting
the
baron
think
that
no
precautions
need
be
taken
against
me
that
was
all
to
the
good
would
have
waited
little
longer
but
his
visit
to
america
forced
my
hand
he
would
never
have
left
so
compromising
document
behind
him
therefore
we
had
to
act
at
once
burglary
at
night
is
impossible
he
takes
precautions
but
there
was
chance
in
the
evening
if
could
only
be
sure
that
his
attention
was
engaged
that
was
where
you
and
your
blue
saucer
came
in
but
had
to
be
sure
of
the
position
of
the
book
and
knew
had
only
few
minutes
in
which
to
act
for
my
time
was
limited
by
your
knowledge
of
chinese
pottery
therefore
gathered
the
girl
up
at
the
last
moment
how
could
guess
what
the
little
packet
was
that
she
carried
so
carefully
under
her
cloak
thought
she
had
come
altogether
on
my
business
but
it
seems
she
had
some
of
her
own
he
guessed
came
from
you
feared
he
would
but
you
held
him
in
play
just
long
enough
for
me
to
get
the
book
though
not
long
enough
for
an
unobserved
escape
ah
sir
james
am
very
glad
you
have
come
our
courtly
friend
had
appeared
in
answer
to
previous
summons
he
listened
with
the
deepest
attention
to
holmes
account
of
what
had
occurred
you
have
done
wonders
he
cried
when
he
had
heard
the
narrative
but
if
these
injuries
are
as
terrible
as
dr
watson
describes
then
surely
our
purpose
of
thwarting
the
marriage
is
sufficiently
gained
without
the
use
of
this
horrible
book
holmes
shook
his
head
women
of
the
de
merville
type
do
not
act
like
that
she
would
love
him
the
more
as
disfigured
martyr
no
it
is
his
moral
side
not
his
physical
which
we
have
to
destroy
that
book
will
bring
her
back
to
earth
and
know
nothing
else
that
could
it
is
in
his
own
writing
she
cannot
get
past
it
sir
james
carried
away
both
it
and
the
precious
saucer
as
was
myself
overdue
went
down
with
him
into
the
street
brougham
was
waiting
for
him
he
sprang
in
gave
hurried
order
to
the
cockaded
coachman
and
drove
swiftly
away
he
flung
his
overcoat
half
out
of
the
window
to
cover
the
armorial
bearings
upon
the
panel
but
had
seen
them
in
the
glare
of
our
fanlight
none
the
less
gasped
with
surprise
then
turned
back
and
ascended
the
stair
to
holmes
room
have
found
out
who
our
client
is
cried
bursting
with
my
great
news
why
holmes
it
is—

it
is
loyal
friend
and
chivalrous
gentleman
said
holmes
holding
up
restraining
hand
let
that
now
and
forever
be
enough
for
us
do
not
know
how
the
incriminating
book
was
used
sir
james
may
have
managed
it
or
it
is
more
probable
that
so
delicate
task
was
entrusted
to
the
young
lady
father
the
effect
at
any
rate
was
all
that
could
be
desired
three
days
later
appeared
paragraph
in
the
morning
post
to
say
that
the
marriage
between
baron
adelbert
gruner
and
miss
violet
de
merville
would
not
take
place
the
same
paper
had
the
first
police
court
hearing
of
the
proceedings
against
miss
kitty
winter
on
the
grave
charge
of
vitriol
throwing
such
extenuating
circumstances
came
out
in
the
trial
that
the
sentence
as
will
be
remembered
was
the
lowest
that
was
possible
for
such
an
offence
sherlock
holmes
was
threatened
with
prosecution
for
burglary
but
when
an
object
is
good
and
client
is
sufficiently
illustrious
even
the
rigid
british
law
becomes
human
and
elastic
my
friend
has
not
yet
stood
in
the
dock
vii
the
adventure
of
the
blanched
soldier
the
ideas
of
my
friend
watson
though
limited
are
exceedingly
pertinacious
for
long
time
he
has
worried
me
to
write
an
experience
of
my
own
perhaps
have
rather
invited
this
persecution
since
have
often
had
occasion
to
point
out
to
him
how
superficial
are
his
own
accounts
and
to
accuse
him
of
pandering
to
popular
taste
instead
of
confining
himself
rigidly
to
facts
and
figures
try
it
yourself
holmes
he
has
retorted
and
am
compelled
to
admit
that
having
taken
my
pen
in
my
hand
do
begin
to
realize
that
the
matter
must
be
presented
in
such
way
as
may
interest
the
reader
the
following
case
can
hardly
fail
to
do
so
as
it
is
among
the
strangest
happenings
in
my
collection
though
it
chanced
that
watson
had
no
note
of
it
in
his
collection
speaking
of
my
old
friend
and
biographer
would
take
this
opportunity
to
remark
that
if
burden
myself
with
companion
in
my
various
little
inquiries
it
is
not
done
out
of
sentiment
or
caprice
but
it
is
that
watson
has
some
remarkable
characteristics
of
his
own
to
which
in
his
modesty
he
has
given
small
attention
amid
his
exaggerated
estimates
of
my
own
performances
confederate
who
foresees
your
conclusions
and
course
of
action
is
always
dangerous
but
one
to
whom
each
development
comes
as
perpetual
surprise
and
to
whom
the
future
is
always
closed
book
is
indeed
an
ideal
helpmate
find
from
my
notebook
that
it
was
in
january
1903
just
after
the
conclusion
of
the
boer
war
that
had
my
visit
from
mr
james
dodd
big
fresh
sunburned
upstanding
briton
the
good
watson
had
at
that
time
deserted
me
for
wife
the
only
selfish
action
which
can
recall
in
our
association
was
alone
it
is
my
habit
to
sit
with
my
back
to
the
window
and
to
place
my
visitors
in
the
opposite
chair
where
the
light
falls
full
upon
them
mr
james
dodd
seemed
somewhat
at
loss
how
to
begin
the
interview
did
not
attempt
to
help
him
for
his
silence
gave
me
more
time
for
observation
have
found
it
wise
to
impress
clients
with
sense
of
power
and
so
gave
him
some
of
my
conclusions
from
south
africa
sir
perceive
yes
sir
he
answered
with
some
surprise
imperial
yeomanry
fancy
exactly
middlesex
corps
no
doubt
that
is
so
mr
holmes
you
are
wizard
smiled
at
his
bewildered
expression
when
gentleman
of
virile
appearance
enters
my
room
with
such
tan
upon
his
face
as
an
english
sun
could
never
give
and
with
his
handkerchief
in
his
sleeve
instead
of
in
his
pocket
it
is
not
difficult
to
place
him
you
wear
short
beard
which
shows
that
you
were
not
regular
you
have
the
cut
of
riding
man
as
to
middlesex
your
card
has
already
shown
me
that
you
are
stockbroker
from
throgmorton
street
what
other
regiment
would
you
join
you
see
everything
see
no
more
than
you
but
have
trained
myself
to
notice
what
see
however
mr
dodd
it
was
not
to
discuss
the
science
of
observation
that
you
called
upon
me
this
morning
what
has
been
happening
at
tuxbury
old
park
mr
holmes—
my
dear
sir
there
is
no
mystery
your
letter
came
with
that
heading
and
as
you
fixed
this
appointment
in
very
pressing
terms
it
was
clear
that
something
sudden
and
important
had
occurred
yes
indeed
but
the
letter
was
written
in
the
afternoon
and
good
deal
has
happened
since
then
if
colonel
emsworth
had
not
kicked
me
out
kicked
you
out
well
that
was
what
it
amounted
to
he
is
hard
nail
is
colonel
emsworth
the
greatest
martinet
in
the
army
in
his
day
and
it
was
day
of
rough
language
too
couldn
have
stuck
the
colonel
if
it
had
not
been
for
godfrey
sake
lit
my
pipe
and
leaned
back
in
my
chair
perhaps
you
will
explain
what
you
are
talking
about
my
client
grinned
mischievously
had
got
into
the
way
of
supposing
that
you
knew
everything
without
being
told
said
he
but
will
give
you
the
facts
and
hope
to
god
that
you
will
be
able
to
tell
me
what
they
mean
ve
been
awake
all
night
puzzling
my
brain
and
the
more
think
the
more
incredible
does
it
become
when
joined
up
in
january
1901—just
two
years
ago
young
godfrey
emsworth
had
joined
the
same
squadron
he
was
colonel
emsworth
only
son
emsworth
the
crimean
and
he
had
the
fighting
blood
in
him
so
it
is
no
wonder
he
volunteered
there
was
not
finer
lad
in
the
regiment
we
formed
friendship
the
sort
of
friendship
which
can
only
be
made
when
one
lives
the
same
life
and
shares
the
same
joys
and
sorrows
he
was
my
mate
and
that
means
good
deal
in
the
army
we
took
the
rough
and
the
smooth
together
for
year
of
hard
fighting
then
he
was
hit
with
bullet
from
an
elephant
gun
in
the
action
near
diamond
hill
outside
pretoria
got
one
letter
from
the
hospital
at
cape
town
and
one
from
southampton
since
then
not
word
not
one
word
mr
holmes
for
six
months
and
more
and
he
my
closest
pal
well
when
the
war
was
over
and
we
all
got
back
wrote
to
his
father
and
asked
where
godfrey
was
no
answer
waited
bit
and
then
wrote
again
this
time
had
reply
short
and
gruff
godfrey
had
gone
on
voyage
round
the
world
and
it
was
not
likely
that
he
would
be
back
for
year
that
was
all
wasn
satisfied
mr
holmes
the
whole
thing
seemed
to
me
so
damned
unnatural
he
was
good
lad
and
he
would
not
drop
pal
like
that
it
was
not
like
him
then
again
happened
to
know
that
he
was
heir
to
lot
of
money
and
also
that
his
father
and
he
did
not
always
hit
it
off
too
well
the
old
man
was
sometimes
bully
and
young
godfrey
had
too
much
spirit
to
stand
it
no
wasn
satisfied
and
determined
that
would
get
to
the
root
of
the
matter
it
happened
however
that
my
own
affairs
needed
lot
of
straightening
out
after
two
years
absence
and
so
it
is
only
this
week
that
have
been
able
to
take
up
godfrey
case
again
but
since
have
taken
it
up
mean
to
drop
everything
in
order
to
see
it
through
mr
james
dodd
appeared
to
be
the
sort
of
person
whom
it
would
be
better
to
have
as
friend
than
as
an
enemy
his
blue
eyes
were
stern
and
his
square
jaw
had
set
hard
as
he
spoke
well
what
have
you
done
asked
my
first
move
was
to
get
down
to
his
home
tuxbury
old
park
near
bedford
and
to
see
for
myself
how
the
ground
lay
wrote
to
the
mother
therefore
had
quite
enough
of
the
curmudgeon
of
father
and
made
clean
frontal
attack
godfrey
was
my
chum
had
great
deal
of
interest
which
might
tell
her
of
our
common
experiences
should
be
in
the
neighbourhood
would
there
be
any
objection
et
cetera
in
reply
had
quite
an
amiable
answer
from
her
and
an
offer
to
put
me
up
for
the
night
that
was
what
took
me
down
on
monday
tuxbury
old
hall
is
inaccessible
five
miles
from
anywhere
there
was
no
trap
at
the
station
so
had
to
walk
carrying
my
suitcase
and
it
was
nearly
dark
before
arrived
it
is
great
wandering
house
standing
in
considerable
park
should
judge
it
was
of
all
sorts
of
ages
and
styles
starting
on
half
timbered
elizabethan
foundation
and
ending
in
victorian
portico
inside
it
was
all
panelling
and
tapestry
and
half
effaced
old
pictures
house
of
shadows
and
mystery
there
was
butler
old
ralph
who
seemed
about
the
same
age
as
the
house
and
there
was
his
wife
who
might
have
been
older
she
had
been
godfrey
nurse
and
had
heard
him
speak
of
her
as
second
only
to
his
mother
in
his
affections
so
was
drawn
to
her
in
spite
of
her
queer
appearance
the
mother
liked
also
gentle
little
white
mouse
of
woman
it
was
only
the
colonel
himself
whom
barred
we
had
bit
of
barney
right
away
and
should
have
walked
back
to
the
station
if
had
not
felt
that
it
might
be
playing
his
game
for
me
to
do
so
was
shown
straight
into
his
study
and
there
found
him
huge
bow
backed
man
with
smoky
skin
and
straggling
grey
beard
seated
behind
his
littered
desk
red
veined
nose
jutted
out
like
vulture
beak
and
two
fierce
grey
eyes
glared
at
me
from
under
tufted
brows
could
understand
now
why
godfrey
seldom
spoke
of
his
father

well
sir
said
he
in
rasping
voice
should
be
interested
to
know
the
real
reasons
for
this
visit
answered
that
had
explained
them
in
my
letter
to
his
wife
yes
you
said
that
you
had
known
godfrey
in
africa
we
have
of
course
only
your
word
for
that
have
his
letters
to
me
in
my
pocket
kindly
let
me
see
them
he
glanced
at
the
two
which
handed
him
and
then
he
tossed
them
back
well
what
then
he
asked
was
fond
of
your
son
godfrey
sir
many
ties
and
memories
united
us
is
it
not
natural
that
should
wonder
at
his
sudden
silence
and
should
wish
to
know
what
has
become
of
him
have
some
recollections
sir
that
had
already
corresponded
with
you
and
had
told
you
what
had
become
of
him
he
has
gone
upon
voyage
round
the
world
his
health
was
in
poor
way
after
his
african
experiences
and
both
his
mother
and
were
of
opinion
that
camplete
rest
and
change
were
needed
kindly
pass
that
explanation
on
to
any
other
friends
who
may
be
interested
in
the
matter
certainly
answered
but
perhaps
you
would
have
the
goodness
to
let
me
have
the
name
of
the
steamer
and
of
the
line
by
which
he
sailed
together
with
the
date
have
no
doubt
that
should
be
able
to
get
letter
through
to
him
my
request
seemed
both
to
puzzle
and
to
irritate
my
host
his
great
eyebrows
came
down
over
his
eyes
and
he
tapped
his
fingers
impatiently
on
the
table
he
looked
up
at
last
with
the
expression
of
one
who
has
seen
his
adversary
make
dangerous
move
at
chess
and
has
decided
how
to
meet
it
many
people
mr
dodd
said
he
would
take
offence
at
your
infernal
pertinacity
and
would
think
that
this
insistence
had
reached
the
point
of
damned
impertinence
you
must
put
it
down
sir
to
my
real
love
for
your
son
exactly
have
already
made
every
allowance
upon
that
score
must
ask
you
however
to
drop
these
inquiries
every
family
has
its
own
inner
knowledge
and
its
own
motives
which
cannot
always
be
made
clear
to
outsiders
however
well
intentioned
my
wife
is
anxious
to
hear
something
of
godfrey
past
which
you
are
in
position
to
tell
her
but
would
ask
you
to
let
the
present
and
the
future
alone
such
inquiries
serve
no
useful
purpose
sir
and
place
us
in
delicate
and
difficult
position
so
came
to
dead
end
mr
holmes
there
was
no
getting
past
it
could
only
pretend
to
accept
the
situation
and
register
vow
inwardly
that
would
never
rest
until
my
friend
fate
had
been
cleared
up
it
was
dull
evening
we
dined
quietly
the
three
of
us
in
gloomy
faded
old
room
the
lady
questioned
me
eagerly
about
her
son
but
the
old
man
seemed
morose
and
depressed
was
so
bored
by
the
whole
proceeding
that
made
an
excuse
as
soon
as
decently
could
and
retired
to
my
bedroom
it
was
large
bare
room
on
the
ground
floor
as
gloomy
as
the
rest
of
the
house
but
after
year
of
sleeping
upon
the
veldt
mr
holmes
one
is
not
too
particular
about
one
quarters
opened
the
curtains
and
looked
out
into
the
garden
remarking
that
it
was
fine
night
with
bright
half
moon
then
sat
down
by
the
roaring
fire
with
the
lamp
on
table
beside
me
and
endeavoured
to
distract
my
mind
with
novel
was
interrupted
however
by
ralph
the
old
butler
who
came
in
with
fresh
supply
of
coals
thought
you
might
run
short
in
the
night
time
sir
it
is
bitter
weather
and
these
rooms
are
cold
he
hesitated
before
leaving
the
room
and
when
looked
round
he
was
standing
facing
me
with
wistful
look
upon
his
wrinkled
face
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
could
not
help
hearing
what
you
said
of
young
master
godfrey
at
dinner
you
know
sir
that
my
wife
nursed
him
and
so
may
say
am
his
foster
father
it
natural
we
should
take
an
interest
and
you
say
he
carried
himself
well
sir
there
was
no
braver
man
in
the
regiment
he
pulled
me
out
once
from
under
the
rifles
of
the
boers
or
maybe
should
not
be
here
the
old
butler
rubbed
his
skinny
hands
yes
sir
yes
that
is
master
godfrey
all
over
he
was
always
courageous
there
not
tree
in
the
park
sir
that
he
has
not
climbed
nothing
would
stop
him
he
was
fine
boy
and
oh
sir
he
was
fine
man
sprang
to
my
feet
look
here
cried
you
say
he
was
you
speak
as
if
he
were
dead
what
is
all
this
mystery
what
has
become
of
godfrey
emsworth
gripped
the
old
man
by
the
shoulder
but
he
shrank
away
don
know
what
you
mean
sir
ask
the
master
about
master
godfrey
he
knows
it
is
not
for
me
to
interfere
he
was
leaving
the
room
but
held
his
arm
listen
said
you
are
going
to
answer
one
question
before
you
leave
if
have
to
hold
you
all
night
is
godfrey
dead
he
could
not
face
my
eyes
he
was
like
man
hypnotized
the
answer
was
dragged
from
his
lips
it
was
terrible
and
unexpected
one
wish
to
god
he
was
he
cried
and
tearing
himself
free
he
dashed
from
the
room
you
will
think
mr
holmes
that
returned
to
my
chair
in
no
very
happy
state
of
mind
the
old
man
words
seemed
to
me
to
bear
only
one
interpretation
clearly
my
poor
friend
had
become
involved
in
some
criminal
or
at
the
least
disreputable
transaction
which
touched
the
family
honour
that
stern
old
man
had
sent
his
son
away
and
hidden
him
from
the
world
lest
some
scandal
should
come
to
light
godfrey
was
reckless
fellow
he
was
easily
influenced
by
those
around
him
no
doubt
he
had
fallen
into
bad
hands
and
been
misled
to
his
ruin
it
was
piteous
business
if
it
was
indeed
so
but
even
now
it
was
my
duty
to
hunt
him
out
and
see
if
could
aid
him
was
anxiously
pondering
the
matter
when
looked
up
and
there
was
godfrey
emsworth
standing
before
me
my
client
had
paused
as
one
in
deep
emotion
pray
continue
said
your
problem
presents
some
very
unusual
features
he
was
outside
the
window
mr
holmes
with
his
face
pressed
against
the
glass
have
told
you
that
looked
out
at
the
night
when
did
so
left
the
curtains
partly
open
his
figure
was
framed
in
this
gap
the
window
came
down
to
the
ground
and
could
see
the
whole
length
of
it
but
it
was
his
face
which
held
my
gaze
he
was
deadly
pale
never
have
seen
man
so
white
reckon
ghosts
may
look
like
that
but
his
eyes
met
mine
and
they
were
the
eyes
of
living
man
he
sprang
back
when
he
saw
that
was
looking
at
him
and
he
vanished
into
the
darkness
there
was
something
shocking
about
the
man
mr
holmes
it
wasn
merely
that
ghastly
face
glimmering
as
white
as
cheese
in
the
darkness
it
was
more
subtle
than
that
something
slinking
something
furtive
something
guilty
something
very
unlike
the
frank
manly
lad
that
had
known
it
left
feeling
of
horror
in
my
mind
but
when
man
has
been
soldiering
for
year
or
two
with
brother
boer
as
playmate
he
keeps
his
nerve
and
acts
quickly
godfrey
had
hardly
vanished
before
was
at
the
window
there
was
an
awkward
catch
and
was
some
little
time
before
could
throw
it
up
then
nipped
through
and
ran
down
the
garden
path
in
the
direction
that
thought
he
might
have
taken
it
was
long
path
and
the
light
was
not
very
good
but
it
seemed
to
me
something
was
moving
ahead
of
me
ran
on
and
called
his
name
but
it
was
no
use
when
got
to
the
end
of
the
path
there
were
several
others
branching
in
different
directions
to
various
outhouses
stood
hesitating
and
as
did
so
heard
distinctly
the
sound
of
closing
door
it
was
not
behind
me
in
the
house
but
ahead
of
me
somewhere
in
the
darkness
that
was
enough
mr
holmes
to
assure
me
that
what
had
seen
was
not
vision
godfrey
had
run
away
from
me
and
he
had
shut
door
behind
him
of
that
was
certain
there
was
nothing
more
could
do
and
spent
an
uneasy
night
turning
the
matter
over
in
my
mind
and
trying
to
find
some
theory
which
would
cover
the
facts
next
day
found
the
colonel
rather
more
conciliatory
and
as
his
wife
remarked
that
there
were
some
places
of
interest
in
the
neighbourhood
it
gave
me
an
opening
to
ask
whether
my
presence
for
one
more
night
would
incommode
them
somewhat
grudging
acquiescence
from
the
old
man
gave
me
clear
day
in
which
to
make
my
observations
was
already
perfectly
convinced
that
godfrey
was
in
hiding
somewhere
near
but
where
and
why
remained
to
be
solved
the
house
was
so
large
and
so
rambling
that
regiment
might
be
hid
away
in
it
and
no
one
the
wiser
if
the
secret
lay
there
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
penetrate
it
but
the
door
which
had
heard
close
was
certainly
not
in
the
house
must
explore
the
garden
and
see
what
could
find
there
was
no
difficulty
in
the
way
for
the
old
people
were
busy
in
their
own
fashion
and
left
me
to
my
own
devices
there
were
several
small
outhouses
but
at
the
end
of
the
garden
there
was
detached
building
of
some
size
large
enough
for
gardener
or
gamekeeper
residence
could
this
be
the
place
whence
the
sound
of
that
shutting
door
had
come
approached
it
in
careless
fashion
as
though
were
strolling
aimlessly
round
the
grounds
as
did
so
small
brisk
bearded
man
in
black
coat
and
bowler
hat
not
at
all
the
gardener
type
came
out
of
the
door
to
my
surprise
he
locked
it
after
him
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
then
he
looked
at
me
with
some
surprise
on
his
face

are
you
visitor
here
he
asked
explained
that
was
and
that
was
friend
of
godfrey
what
pity
that
he
should
be
away
on
his
travels
for
he
would
have
so
liked
to
see
me
continued
quite
so
exactly
said
he
with
rather
guilty
air
no
doubt
you
will
renew
your
visit
at
some
more
propitious
time
he
passed
on
but
when
turned
observed
that
he
was
standing
watching
me
half
concealed
by
the
laurels
at
the
far
end
of
the
garden
had
good
look
at
the
little
house
as
passed
it
but
the
windows
were
heavily
curtained
and
so
far
as
one
could
see
it
was
empty
might
spoil
my
own
game
and
even
be
ordered
off
the
premises
if
were
too
audacious
for
was
still
conscious
that
was
being
watched
therefore
strolled
back
to
the
house
and
waited
for
night
before
went
on
with
my
inquiry
when
all
was
dark
and
quiet
slipped
out
of
my
window
and
made
my
way
as
silently
as
possible
to
the
mysterious
lodge
have
said
that
it
was
heavily
curtained
but
now
found
that
the
windows
were
shuttered
as
well
some
light
however
was
breaking
through
one
of
them
so
concentrated
my
attention
upon
this
was
in
luck
for
the
curtain
had
not
been
quite
closed
and
there
was
crack
in
the
shutter
so
that
could
see
the
inside
of
the
room
it
was
cheery
place
enough
bright
lamp
and
blazing
fire
opposite
to
me
was
seated
the
little
man
whom
had
seen
in
the
morning
he
was
smoking
pipe
and
reading
paper
what
paper
asked
my
client
seemed
annoyed
at
the
interruption
of
his
narrative
can
it
matter
he
asked
it
is
most
essential
really
took
no
notice
possibly
you
observed
whether
it
was
broad
leafed
paper
or
of
that
smaller
type
which
one
associates
with
weeklies
now
that
you
mention
it
was
not
large
it
might
have
been
the
spectator
however
had
little
thought
to
spare
upon
such
details
for
second
man
was
seated
with
his
back
to
the
window
and
could
swear
that
this
second
man
was
godfrey
could
not
see
his
face
but
knew
the
familiar
slope
of
his
shoulders
he
was
leaning
upon
his
elbow
in
an
attitude
of
great
melancholy
his
body
turned
towards
the
fire
was
hesitating
as
to
what
should
do
when
there
was
sharp
tap
on
my
shoulder
and
there
was
colonel
emsworth
beside
me
this
way
sir
said
he
in
low
voice
he
walked
in
silence
to
the
house
and
followed
him
into
my
own
bedroom
he
had
picked
up
time
table
in
the
hall
there
is
train
to
london
at
30
said
he
the
trap
will
be
at
the
door
at
eight
he
was
white
with
rage
and
indeed
felt
myself
in
so
difficult
position
that
could
only
stammer
out
few
incoherent
apologies
in
which
tried
to
excuse
myself
by
urging
my
anxiety
for
my
friend
the
matter
will
not
bear
discussion
said
he
abruptly
you
have
made
most
damnable
intrusion
into
the
privacy
of
our
family
you
were
here
as
guest
and
you
have
become
spy
have
nothing
more
to
say
sir
save
that
have
no
wish
ever
to
see
you
again
at
this
lost
my
temper
mr
holmes
and
spoke
with
some
warmth
have
seen
your
son
and
am
convinced
that
for
some
reason
of
your
own
you
are
concealing
him
from
the
world
have
no
idea
what
your
motives
are
in
cutting
him
off
in
this
fashion
but
am
sure
that
he
is
no
longer
free
agent
warn
you
colonel
emsworth
that
until
am
assured
as
to
the
safety
and
well
being
of
my
friend
shall
never
desist
in
my
efforts
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
mystery
and
shall
certainly
not
allow
myself
to
be
intimidated
by
anything
which
you
may
say
or
do
the
old
fellow
looked
diabolical
and
really
thought
he
was
about
to
attack
me
have
said
that
he
was
gaunt
fierce
old
giant
and
though
am
no
weakling
might
have
been
hard
put
to
it
to
hold
my
own
against
him
however
after
long
glare
of
rage
he
turned
upon
his
heel
and
walked
out
of
the
room
for
my
part
took
the
appointed
train
in
the
morning
with
the
full
intention
of
coming
straight
to
you
and
asking
for
your
advice
and
assistance
at
the
appointment
for
which
had
already
written
such
was
the
problem
which
my
visitor
laid
before
me
it
presented
as
the
astute
reader
will
have
already
perceived
few
difficulties
in
its
solution
for
very
limited
choice
of
alternatives
must
get
to
the
root
of
the
matter
still
elementary
as
it
was
there
were
points
of
interest
and
novelty
about
it
which
may
excuse
my
placing
it
upon
record
now
proceeded
using
my
familiar
method
of
logical
analysis
to
narrow
down
the
possible
solutions
the
servants
asked
how
many
were
in
the
house
to
the
best
of
my
belief
there
were
only
the
old
butler
and
his
wife
they
seemed
to
live
in
the
simplest
fashion
there
was
no
servant
then
in
the
detached
house
none
unless
the
little
man
with
the
beard
acted
as
such
he
seemed
however
to
be
quite
superior
person
that
seems
very
suggestive
had
you
any
indication
that
food
was
conveyed
from
the
one
house
to
the
other
now
that
you
mention
it
did
see
old
ralph
carrying
basket
down
the
garden
walk
and
going
in
the
direction
of
this
house
the
idea
of
food
did
not
occur
to
me
at
the
moment
did
you
make
any
local
inquiries
yes
did
spoke
to
the
station
master
and
also
to
the
innkeeper
in
the
village
simply
asked
if
they
knew
anything
of
my
old
comrade
godfrey
emsworth
both
of
them
assured
me
that
he
had
gone
for
voyage
round
the
world
he
had
come
home
and
then
had
almost
at
once
started
off
again
the
story
was
evidently
universally
accepted
you
said
nothing
of
your
suspicions
nothing
that
was
very
wise
the
matter
should
certainly
be
inquired
into
will
go
back
with
you
to
tuxbury
old
park
to
day
it
happened
that
at
the
moment
was
clearing
up
the
case
which
my
friend
watson
has
described
as
that
of
the
abbey
school
in
which
the
duke
of
greyminster
was
so
deeply
involved
had
also
commission
from
the
sultan
of
turkey
which
called
for
immediate
action
as
political
consequences
of
the
gravest
kind
might
arise
from
its
neglect
therefore
it
was
not
until
the
beginning
of
the
next
week
as
my
diary
records
that
was
able
to
start
forth
on
my
mission
to
bedfordshire
in
company
with
mr
james
dodd
as
we
drove
to
eustonn
we
picked
up
grave
and
tacitum
gentleman
of
iron
grey
aspect
with
whom
had
made
the
necessary
arrangements
this
is
an
old
friend
said
to
dodd
it
is
possible
that
his
presence
may
be
entirely
unnecessary
and
on
the
other
hand
it
may
be
essential
it
is
not
necessary
at
the
present
stage
to
go
further
into
the
matter
the
narratives
of
watson
have
accustomed
the
reader
no
doubt
to
the
fact
that
do
not
waste
words
or
disclose
my
thoughts
while
case
is
actually
under
consideration
dodd
seemed
surprised
but
nothing
more
was
said
and
the
three
of
us
continued
our
journey
together
in
the
train
asked
dodd
one
more
question
which
wished
our
companion
to
hear
you
say
that
you
saw
your
friend
face
quite
clearly
at
the
window
so
clearly
that
you
are
sure
of
his
identity
have
no
doubt
about
it
whatever
his
nose
was
pressed
against
the
glass
the
lamplight
shone
full
upon
him
it
could
not
have
been
someone
resembling
him
no
it
was
he
but
you
say
he
was
changed
only
in
colour
his
face
was
how
shall
describe
it
was
of
fish
belly
whiteness
it
was
bleached
was
it
equally
pale
all
over
think
not
it
was
his
brow
which
saw
so
clearly
as
it
was
pressed
against
the
window
did
you
call
to
him
was
too
startled
and
horrified
for
the
moment
then
pursued
him
as
have
told
you
but
without
result
my
case
was
practically
complete
and
there
was
only
one
small
incident
needed
to
round
it
off
when
after
considerable
drive
we
arrived
at
the
strange
old
rambling
house
which
my
client
had
described
it
was
ralph
the
elderly
butler
who
opened
the
door
had
requisitioned
the
carriage
for
the
day
and
had
asked
my
elderly
friend
to
remain
within
it
unless
we
should
summon
him
ralph
little
wrinkled
old
fellow
was
in
the
conventional
costume
of
black
coat
and
pepper
and
salt
trousers
with
only
one
curious
variant
he
wore
brown
leather
gloves
which
at
sight
of
us
he
instantly
shuffled
off
laying
them
down
on
the
hall
table
as
we
passed
in
have
as
my
friend
watson
may
have
remarked
an
abnormally
acute
set
of
senses
and
faint
but
incisive
scent
was
apparent
it
seemed
to
centre
on
the
hall
table
turned
placed
my
hat
there
knocked
it
off
stooped
to
pick
it
up
and
contrived
to
bring
my
nose
within
foot
of
the
gloves
yes
it
was
undoubtedly
from
them
that
the
curious
tarry
odour
was
oozing
passed
on
into
the
study
with
my
case
complete
alas
that
should
have
to
show
my
hand
so
when
tell
my
own
story
it
was
by
concealing
such
links
in
the
chain
that
watson
was
enabled
to
produce
his
meretricious

colonel
emsworth
was
not
in
his
room
but
he
came
quickly
enough
on
receipt
of
ralph
message
we
heard
his
quick
heavy
step
in
the
passage
the
door
was
flung
open
and
he
rushed
in
with
bristling
beard
and
twisted
features
as
terrible
an
old
man
as
ever
have
seen
he
held
our
cards
in
his
hand
and
he
tore
them
up
and
stamped
on
the
fragments
have
not
told
you
infernal
busybody
that
you
are
warned
off
the
premises
never
dare
to
show
your
damned
face
here
again
if
you
enter
again
without
my
leave
shall
be
within
my
rights
if
use
violence
ll
shoot
you
sir
by
god
will
as
to
you
sir
turning
upon
me
extend
the
same
warning
to
you
am
familiar
with
your
ignoble
profession
but
you
must
take
your
reputed
talents
to
some
other
field
there
is
no
opening
for
them
here
cannot
leave
here
said
my
client
firmly
until
hear
from
godfrey
own
lips
that
he
is
under
no
restraint
our
involuntary
host
rang
the
bell
ralph
he
said
telephone
down
to
the
county
police
and
ask
the
inspector
to
send
up
two
constables
tell
him
there
are
burglars
in
the
house
one
moment
said
you
must
be
aware
mr
dodd
that
colonel
emsworth
is
within
his
rights
and
that
we
have
no
legal
status
within
his
house
on
the
other
hand
he
should
recognize
that
your
action
is
prompted
entirely
by
solicitude
for
his
son
venture
to
hope
that
if
were
allowed
to
have
five
minutes
conversation
with
colonel
emsworth
could
certainly
alter
his
view
of
the
matter
am
not
so
easily
altered
said
the
old
soldier
ralph
do
what
have
told
you
what
the
devil
are
you
waiting
for
ring
up
the
police
nothing
of
the
sort
said
putting
my
back
to
the
door
any
police
interference
would
bring
about
the
very
catastrophe
which
you
dread
took
out
my
notebook
and
scribbled
one
word
upon
loose
sheet
that
said
as
handed
it
to
colonel
emsworth
is
what
has
brought
us
here
he
stared
at
the
writing
with
face
from
which
every
expression
save
amazement
had
vanished
how
do
you
know
he
gasped
sitting
down
heavily
in
his
chair
it
is
my
business
to
know
things
that
is
my
trade
he
sat
in
deep
thought
his
gaunt
hand
tugging
at
his
straggling
beard
then
he
made
gesture
of
resignation
well
if
you
wish
to
see
godfrey
you
shall
it
is
no
doing
of
mine
but
you
have
forced
my
hand
ralph
tell
mr
godfrey
and
mr
kent
that
in
five
minutes
we
shall
be
with
them
at
the
end
of
that
time
we
passed
down
the
garden
path
and
found
ourselves
in
front
of
the
mystery
house
at
the
end
small
bearded
man
stood
at
the
door
with
look
of
considerable
astonishment
upon
his
face
this
is
very
sudden
colonel
emsworth
said
he
this
will
disarrange
all
our
plans
can
help
it
mr
kent
our
hands
have
been
forced
can
mr
godfrey
see
us
yes
he
is
waiting
inside
he
turned
and
led
us
into
large
plainly
furnished
front
room
man
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
at
the
sight
of
him
my
client
sprang
forward
with
outstretched
hand
why
godfrey
old
man
this
is
fine
but
the
other
waved
him
back
don
touch
me
jimmie
keep
your
distance
yes
you
may
well
stare
don
quite
look
the
smart
lance
corporal
emsworth
of
squadron
do
his
appearance
was
certainly
extraordinary
one
could
see
that
he
had
indeed
been
handsome
man
with
clear
cut
features
sunburned
by
an
african
sun
but
mottled
in
patches
over
this
darker
surface
were
curious
whitish
patches
which
had
bleached
his
skin
that
why
don
court
visitors
said
he
don
mind
you
jimmie
but
could
have
done
without
your
friend
suppose
there
is
some
good
reason
for
it
but
you
have
me
at
disadvantage
wanted
to
be
sure
that
all
was
well
with
you
godfrey
saw
you
that
night
when
you
looked
into
my
window
and
could
not
let
the
matter
rest
till
had
cleared
things
up
old
ralph
told
me
you
were
there
and
couldn
help
taking
peep
at
you
hoped
you
would
not
have
seen
me
and
had
to
run
to
my
burrow
when
heard
the
window
go
up
but
what
in
heaven
name
is
the
matter
well
it
not
long
story
to
tell
said
he
lighting
cigarette
you
remember
that
morning
fight
at
buffelsspruit
outside
pretoria
on
the
eastern
railway
line
you
heard
was
hit
yes
heard
that
but
never
got
particulars
three
of
us
got
separated
from
the
others
it
was
very
broken
country
you
may
remember
there
was
simpson
the
fellow
we
called
baldy
simpson
and
anderson
and
we
were
clearing
brother
boer
but
he
lay
low
and
got
the
three
of
us
the
other
two
were
killed
got
an
elephant
bullet
through
my
shoulder
stuck
on
to
my
horse
however
and
he
galloped
several
miles
before
fainted
and
rolled
off
the
saddle
when
came
to
myself
it
was
nightfall
and
raised
myself
up
feeling
very
weak
and
ill
to
my
surprise
there
was
house
close
beside
me
fairly
large
house
with
broad
stoep
and
many
windows
it
was
deadly
cold
you
remember
the
kind
of
numb
cold
which
used
to
come
at
evening
deadly
sickening
sort
of
cold
very
different
from
crisp
healthy
frost
well
was
chilled
to
the
bone
and
my
only
hope
seemed
to
lie
in
reaching
that
house
staggered
to
my
feet
and
dragged
myself
along
hardly
conscious
of
what
did
have
dim
memory
of
slowly
ascending
the
steps
entering
wide
opened
door
passing
into
large
room
which
contained
several
beds
and
throwing
myself
down
with
gasp
of
satisfaction
upon
one
of
them
it
was
unmade
but
that
troubled
me
not
at
all
drew
the
clothes
over
my
shivering
body
and
in
moment
was
in
deep
sleep
it
was
morning
when
wakened
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
instead
of
coming
out
into
world
of
sanity
had
emerged
into
some
extraordinary
nightmare
the
african
sun
flooded
through
the
big
curtainless
windows
and
every
detail
of
the
great
bare
whitewashed
dormitory
stood
out
hard
and
clear
in
front
of
me
was
standing
small
dwarf
like
man
with
huge
bulbous
head
who
was
jabbering
excitedly
in
dutch
waving
two
horrible
hands
which
looked
to
me
like
brown
sponges
behind
him
stood
group
of
people
who
seemed
to
be
intensely
amused
by
the
situation
but
chill
came
over
me
as
looked
at
them
not
one
of
them
was
normal
human
being
every
one
was
twisted
or
swollen
or
disfigured
in
some
strange
way
the
laughter
of
these
strange
monstrosities
was
dreadful
thing
to
hear
it
seemed
that
none
of
them
could
speak
english
but
the
situation
wanted
clearing
up
for
the
creature
with
the
big
head
was
growing
furiously
angry
and
uttering
wild
beast
cries
he
had
laid
his
deformed
hands
upon
me
and
was
dragging
me
out
of
bed
regardless
of
the
fresh
flow
of
blood
from
my
wound
the
little
monster
was
as
strong
as
bull
and
don
know
what
he
might
have
done
to
me
had
not
an
elderly
man
who
was
clearly
in
authority
been
attracted
to
the
room
by
the
hubbub
he
said
few
stern
words
in
dutch
and
my
persecutor
shrank
away
then
he
turned
upon
me
gazing
at
me
in
the
utmost
amazement
how
in
the
world
did
you
come
here
he
asked
in
amazement
wait
bit
see
that
you
are
tired
out
and
that
wounded
shoulder
of
yours
wants
looking
after
am
doctor
and
ll
soon
have
you
tied
up
but
man
alive
you
are
in
far
greater
danger
here
than
ever
you
were
on
the
battlefield
you
are
in
the
leper
hospital
and
you
have
slept
in
leper
bed
need
tell
you
more
jimmie
it
seems
that
in
view
of
the
approaching
battle
all
these
poor
creatures
had
been
evacuated
the
day
before
then
as
the
british
advanced
they
had
been
brought
back
by
this
their
medical
superintendent
who
assured
me
that
though
he
believed
he
was
immune
to
the
disease
he
would
none
the
less
never
have
dared
to
do
what
had
done
he
put
me
in
private
room
treated
me
kindly
and
within
week
or
so
was
removed
to
the
general
hospital
at
pretoria
so
there
you
have
my
tragedy
hoped
against
hope
but
it
was
not
until
had
reached
home
that
the
terrible
signs
which
you
see
upon
my
face
told
me
that
had
not
escaped
what
was
to
do
was
in
this
lonely
house
we
had
two
servants
whom
we
could
utterly
trust
there
was
house
where
could
live
under
pledge
of
secrecy
mr
kent
who
is
surgeon
was
prepared
to
stay
with
me
it
seemed
simple
enough
on
those
lines
the
alternative
was
dreadful
one
segregation
for
life
among
strangers
with
never
hope
of
release
but
absolute
secrecy
was
necessary
or
even
in
this
quiet
countryside
there
would
have
been
an
outcry
and
should
have
been
dragged
to
my
horrible
doom
even
you
jimmie
even
you
had
to
be
kept
in
the
dark
why
my
father
has
relented
cannot
imagine
colonel
emsworth
pointed
to
me
this
is
the
gentleman
who
forced
my
hand
he
unfolded
the
scrap
of
paper
on
which
had
written
the
word
leprosy
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
he
knew
so
much
as
that
it
was
safer
that
he
should
know
all

and
so
it
was
said
who
knows
but
good
may
come
of
it
understand
that
only
mr
kent
has
seen
the
patient
may
ask
sir
if
you
are
an
authority
on
such
complaints
which
are
understand
tropical
or
semi
tropical
in
their
nature
have
the
ordinary
knowledge
of
the
educated
medical
man
he
observed
with
some
stiffness
have
no
doubt
sir
that
you
are
fully
competent
but
am
sure
that
you
will
agree
that
in
such
case
second
opinion
is
valuable
you
have
avoided
this
understand
for
fear
that
pressure
should
be
put
upon
you
to
segregate
the
patient
that
is
so
said
colonel
emsworth
foresaw
this
situation
explained
and
have
brought
with
me
friend
whose
discretion
may
absolutely
be
trusted
was
able
once
to
do
him
professional
service
and
he
is
ready
to
advise
as
friend
rather
than
as
specialist
his
name
is
sir
james
saunders
the
prospect
of
an
interview
with
lord
roberts
would
not
have
excited
greater
wonder
and
pleasure
in
raw
subaltern
than
was
now
reflected
upon
the
face
of
mr
kent
shall
indeed
be
proud
he
murmured
then
will
ask
sir
james
to
step
this
way
he
is
at
present
in
the
carriage
outside
the
door
meanwhile
colonel
emsworth
we
may
perhaps
assemble
in
your
study
where
could
give
the
necessary
explanations
and
here
it
is
that
miss
my
watson
by
cunning
questions
and
ejaculations
of
wonder
he
could
elevate
my
simple
art
which
is
but
systematized
common
sense
into
prodigy
when
tell
my
own
story
have
no
such
aid
and
yet
will
give
my
process
of
thought
even
as
gave
it
to
my
small
audience
which
included
godfrey
mother
in
the
study
of
colonel
emsworth
that
process
said
starts
upon
the
supposition
that
when
you
have
eliminated
all
which
is
impossible
then
whatever
remains
however
improbable
must
be
the
truth
it
may
well
be
that
several
explanations
remain
in
which
case
one
tries
test
after
test
until
one
or
other
of
them
has
convincing
amount
of
support
we
will
now
apply
this
principle
to
the
case
in
point
as
it
was
first
presented
to
me
there
were
three
possible
explanations
of
the
seclusion
or
incarceration
of
this
gentleman
in
an
outhouse
of
his
father
mansion
there
was
the
explanation
that
he
was
in
hiding
for
crime
or
that
he
was
mad
and
that
they
wished
to
avoid
an
asylum
or
that
he
had
some
disease
which
caused
his
segregation
could
think
of
no
other
adequate
solutions
these
then
had
to
be
sifted
and
balanced
against
each
other
the
criminal
solution
would
not
bear
inspection
no
unsolved
crime
had
been
reported
from
that
district
was
sure
of
that
if
it
were
some
crime
not
yet
discovered
then
clearly
it
would
be
to
the
interest
of
the
family
to
get
rid
of
the
delinquent
and
send
him
abroad
rather
than
keep
him
concealed
at
home
could
see
no
explanation
for
such
line
of
conduct
insanity
was
more
plausible
the
presence
of
the
second
person
in
the
outhouse
suggested
keeper
the
fact
that
he
locked
the
door
when
he
came
out
strengthened
the
supposition
and
gave
the
idea
of
constraint
on
the
other
hand
this
constraint
could
not
be
severe
or
the
young
man
could
not
have
got
loose
and
come
down
to
have
look
at
his
friend
you
will
remember
mr
dodd
that
felt
round
for
points
asking
you
for
example
about
the
paper
which
mr
kent
was
reading
had
it
been
the
lancet
or
the
british
medical
journal
it
would
have
helped
me
it
is
not
illegal
however
to
keep
lunatic
upon
private
premises
so
long
as
there
is
qualified
person
in
attendance
and
that
the
authorities
have
been
duly
notified
why
then
all
this
desperate
desire
for
secrecy
once
again
could
not
get
the
theory
to
fit
the
facts
there
remained
the
third
possibility
into
which
rare
and
unlikely
as
it
was
everything
seemed
to
fit
leprosy
is
not
uncommon
in
south
africa
by
some
extraordinary
chance
this
youth
might
have
contracted
it
his
people
would
be
placed
in
very
dreadful
position
since
they
would
desire
to
save
him
from
segregation
great
secrecy
would
be
needed
to
prevent
rumours
from
getting
about
and
subsequent
interference
by
the
authorities
devoted
medical
man
if
sufficiently
paid
would
easily
be
found
to
take
charge
of
the
sufferer
there
would
be
no
reason
why
the
latter
should
not
be
allowed
freedom
after
dark
bleaching
of
the
skin
is
common
result
of
the
disease
the
case
was
strong
one
so
strong
that
determined
to
act
as
if
it
were
actually
proved
when
on
arriving
here
noticed
that
ralph
who
carries
out
the
meals
had
gloves
which
are
impregnated
with
disinfectants
my
last
doubts
were
removed
single
word
showed
you
sir
that
your
secret
was
discovered
and
if
wrote
rather
than
said
it
was
to
prove
to
you
that
my
discretion
was
to
be
trusted
was
finishing
this
little
analysis
of
the
case
when
the
door
was
opened
and
the
austere
figure
of
the
great
dermatologist
was
ushered
in
but
for
once
his
sphinx
like
features
had
relaxed
and
there
was
warm
humanity
in
his
eyes
he
strode
up
to
colonel
emsworth
and
shook
him
by
the
hand
it
is
often
my
lot
to
bring
ill
tidings
and
seldom
good
said
he
this
occasion
is
the
more
welcome
it
is
not
leprosy
what
well
marked
case
of
pseudo
leprosy
or
ichthyosis
scalelike
affection
of
the
skin
unsightly
obstinate
but
possibly
curable
and
certainly
noninfective
yes
mr
holmes
the
coincidence
is
remarkable
one
but
is
it
coincidence
are
there
not
subtle
forces
at
work
of
which
we
know
little
are
we
assured
that
the
apprehension
from
which
this
young
man
has
no
doubt
suffered
terribly
since
his
exposure
to
its
contagion
may
not
produce
physical
effect
which
simulates
that
which
it
fears
at
any
rate
pledge
my
professional
reputation
but
the
lady
has
fainted
think
that
mr
kent
had
better
be
with
her
until
she
recovers
from
this
joyous
shock
viii
the
adventure
of
the
retired
colourman
sherlock
holmes
was
in
melancholy
and
philosophic
mood
that
morning
his
alert
practical
nature
was
subject
to
such
reactions
did
you
see
him
he
asked
you
mean
the
old
fellow
who
has
just
gone
out
precisely
yes
met
him
at
the
door
what
did
you
think
of
him
pathetic
futile
broken
creature
exactly
watson
pathetic
and
futile
but
is
not
all
life
pathetic
and
futile
is
not
his
story
microcosm
of
the
whole
we
reach
we
grasp
and
what
is
left
in
our
hands
at
the
end
shadow
or
worse
than
shadow
misery
is
he
one
of
your
clients
well
suppose
may
call
him
so
he
has
been
sent
on
by
the
yard
just
as
medical
men
occasionally
send
their
incurables
to
quack
they
argue
that
they
can
do
nothing
more
and
that
whatever
happens
the
patient
can
be
no
worse
than
he
is
what
is
the
matter
holmes
took
rather
soiled
card
from
the
table
josiah
amberley
he
says
he
was
junior
partner
of
brickfall
and
amberley
who
are
manufacturers
of
artistic
materials
you
will
see
their
names
upon
paint
boxes
he
made
his
little
pile
retired
from
business
at
the
age
of
sixty
one
bought
house
at
lewisham
and
settled
down
to
rest
after
life
of
ceaseless
grind
one
would
think
his
future
was
tolerably
assured
yes
indeed
holmes
glanced
over
some
notes
which
he
had
scribbled
upon
the
back
of
an
envelope
retired
in
1896
watson
early
in
1897
he
married
woman
twenty
years
younger
than
himself
good
looking
woman
too
if
the
photograph
does
not
flatter
competence
wife
leisure
it
seemed
straight
road
which
lay
before
him
and
yet
within
two
years
he
is
as
you
have
seen
as
broken
and
miserable
creature
as
crawls
beneath
the
sun
but
what
has
happened
the
old
story
watson
treacherous
friend
and
fickle
wife
it
would
appear
that
amberley
has
one
hobby
in
life
and
it
is
chess
not
far
from
him
at
lewisham
there
lives
young
doctor
who
is
also
chess
player
have
noted
his
name
as
dr
ray
ernest
was
frequently
in
the
house
and
an
intimacy
between
him
and
mrs
amberley
was
natural
sequence
for
you
must
admit
that
our
unfortunate
client
has
few
outward
graces
whatever
his
inner
virtues
may
be
the
couple
went
off
together
last
week
destination
untraced
what
is
more
the
faithless
spouse
carried
off
the
old
man
deed
box
as
her
personal
luggage
with
good
part
of
his
life
savings
within
can
we
find
the
lady
can
we
save
the
money
commonplace
problem
so
far
as
it
has
developed
and
yet
vital
one
for
josiah
amberley
what
will
you
do
about
it
well
the
immediate
question
my
dear
watson
happens
to
be
what
will
you
do
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
understudy
me
you
know
that
am
preoccupied
with
this
case
of
the
two
coptic
patriarchs
which
should
come
to
head
to
day
really
have
not
time
to
go
out
to
lewisham
and
yet
evidence
taken
on
the
spot
has
special
value
the
old
fellow
was
quite
insistent
that
should
go
but
explained
my
difficulty
he
is
prepared
to
meet

by
all
means
answered
confess
don
see
that
can
be
of
much
service
but
am
willing
to
do
my
best
and
so
it
was
that
on
summer
afternoon
set
forth
to
lewisham
little
dreaming
that
within
week
the
affair
in
which
was
engaging
would
be
the
eager
debate
of
all
england
it
was
late
that
evening
before
returned
to
baker
street
and
gave
an
account
of
my
mission
holmes
lay
with
his
gaunt
figure
stretched
in
his
deep
chair
his
pipe
curling
forth
slow
wreaths
of
acrid
tobacco
while
his
eyelids
drooped
over
his
eyes
so
lazily
that
he
might
almost
have
been
asleep
were
it
not
that
at
any
halt
or
questionable
passage
of
my
narrative
they
half
lifted
and
two
grey
eyes
as
bright
and
keen
as
rapiers
transfixed
me
with
their
searching
glance
the
haven
is
the
name
of
mr
josiah
amberley
house
explained
think
it
would
interest
you
holmes
it
is
like
some
penurious
patrician
who
has
sunk
into
the
company
of
his
inferiors
you
know
that
particular
quarter
the
monotonous
brick
streets
the
weary
suburban
highways
right
in
the
middle
of
them
little
island
of
ancient
culture
and
comfort
lies
this
old
home
surrounded
by
high
sun
baked
wall
mottled
with
lichens
and
topped
with
moss
the
sort
of
wall—
cut
out
the
poetry
watson
said
holmes
severely
note
that
it
was
high
brick
wall
exactly
should
not
have
known
which
was
the
haven
had
not
asked
lounger
who
was
smoking
in
the
street
have
reason
for
mentioning
him
he
was
tall
dark
heavily
moustached
rather
military
looking
man
he
nodded
in
answer
to
my
inquiry
and
gave
me
curiously
questioning
glance
which
came
back
to
my
memory
little
later
had
hardly
entered
the
gateway
before
saw
mr
amberley
coming
down
the
drive
only
had
glimpse
of
him
this
morning
and
he
certainly
gave
me
the
impression
of
strange
creature
but
when
saw
him
in
full
light
his
appearance
was
even
more
abnormal
have
of
course
studied
it
and
yet
should
be
interested
to
have
your
impression
said
holmes
he
seemed
to
me
like
man
who
was
literally
bowed
down
by
care
his
back
was
curved
as
though
he
carried
heavy
burden
yet
he
was
not
the
weakling
that
had
at
first
imagined
for
his
shoulders
and
chest
have
the
framework
of
giant
though
his
figure
tapers
away
into
pair
of
spindled
legs
left
shoe
wrinkled
right
one
smooth
did
not
observe
that
no
you
wouldn
spotted
his
artificial
limb
but
proceed
was
struck
by
the
snaky
locks
of
grizzled
hair
which
curled
from
under
his
old
straw
hat
and
his
face
with
its
fierce
eager
expression
and
the
deeply
lined
features
very
good
watson
what
did
he
say
he
began
pouring
out
the
story
of
his
grievances
we
walked
down
the
drive
together
and
of
course
took
good
look
round
have
never
seen
worse
kept
place
the
garden
was
all
running
to
seed
giving
me
an
impression
of
wild
neglect
in
which
the
plants
had
been
allowed
to
find
the
way
of
nature
rather
than
of
art
how
any
decent
woman
could
have
tolerated
such
state
of
things
don
know
the
house
too
was
slatternly
to
the
last
degree
but
the
poor
man
seemed
himself
to
be
aware
of
it
and
to
be
trying
to
remedy
it
for
great
pot
of
green
paint
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
hall
and
he
was
carrying
thick
brush
in
his
left
hand
he
had
been
working
on
the
woodwork
he
took
me
into
his
dingy
sanctum
and
we
had
long
chat
of
course
he
was
disappointed
that
you
had
not
come
yourself
hardly
expected
he
said
that
so
humble
an
individual
as
myself
especially
after
my
heavy
financial
loss
could
obtain
the
complete
attention
of
so
famous
man
as
mr
sherlock
holmes
assured
him
that
the
financial
question
did
not
arise
no
of
course
it
is
art
for
art
sake
with
him
said
he
but
even
on
the
artistic
side
of
crime
he
might
have
found
something
here
to
study
and
human
nature
dr
watson
the
black
ingratitude
of
it
all
when
did
ever
refuse
one
of
her
requests
was
ever
woman
so
pampered
and
that
young
man
he
might
have
been
my
own
son
he
had
the
run
of
my
house
and
yet
see
how
they
have
treated
me
oh
dr
watson
it
is
dreadful
world
that
was
the
burden
of
his
song
for
an
hour
or
more
he
had
it
seems
no
suspicion
of
an
intrigue
they
lived
alone
save
for
woman
who
comes
in
by
the
day
and
leaves
every
evening
at
six
on
that
particular
evening
old
amberley
wishing
to
give
his
wife
treat
had
taken
two
upper
circle
seats
at
the
haymarket
theatre
at
the
last
moment
she
had
complained
of
headache
and
had
refused
to
go
he
had
gone
alone
there
seemed
to
be
no
doubt
about
the
fact
for
he
produced
the
unused
ticket
which
he
had
taken
for
his
wife
that
is
remarkable
most
remarkable
said
holmes
whose
interest
in
the
case
seemed
to
be
rising
pray
continue
watson
find
your
narrative
most
arresting
did
you
personally
examine
this
ticket
you
did
not
perchance
take
the
number
it
so
happens
that
did
answered
with
some
pride
it
chanced
to
be
my
old
school
number
thirty
one
and
so
is
stuck
in
my
head
excellent
watson
his
seat
then
was
either
thirty
or
thirty
two
quite
so
answered
with
some
mystification
and
on
row
that
is
most
satisfactory
what
else
did
he
tell
you
he
showed
me
his
strong
room
as
he
called
it
really
is
strong
room
like
bank
with
iron
door
and
shutter—
burglarproof
as
he
claimed
however
the
woman
seems
to
have
had
duplicate
key
and
between
them
they
had
carried
off
some
seven
thousand
pounds
worth
of
cash
and
securities
how
could
they
dispose
of
those
he
said
that
he
had
given
the
police
list
and
that
he
hoped
they
would
be
unsaleable
he
had
got
back
from
the
theatre
about
midnight
and
found
the
place
plundered
the
door
and
window
open
and
the
fugitives
gone
there
was
no
letter
or
message
nor
has
he
heard
word
since
he
at
once
gave
the
alarm
to
the
police
holmes
brooded
for
some
minutes
you
say
he
was
painting
what
was
he
painting
well
he
was
painting
the
passage
but
he
had
already
painted
the
door
and
woodwork
of
this
room
spoke
of
does
it
not
strike
you
as
strange
occupation
in
the
circumstances
one
must
do
something
to
ease
an
aching
heart
that
was
his
own
explanation
it
was
eccentric
no
doubt
but
he
is
clearly
an
eccentric
man
he
tore
up
one
of
his
wife
photographs
in
my
presence
tore
it
up
furiously
in
tempest
of
passion
never
wish
to
see
her
damned
face
again
he
shrieked
anything
more
watson
yes
one
thing
which
struck
me
more
than
anything
else
had
driven
to
the
blackheath
station
and
had
caught
my
train
there
when
just
as
it
was
starting
saw
man
dart
into
the
carriage
next
to
my
own
you
know
that
have
quick
eye
for
faces
holmes
it
was
undoubtedly
the
tall
dark
man
whom
had
addressed
in
the
street
saw
him
once
more
at
london
bridge
and
then
lost
him
in
the
crowd
but
am
convinced
that
he
was
following
me
no
doubt
no
doubt
said
holmes
tall
dark
heavily
moustached
man
you
say
with
grey
tinted
sun
glasses
holmes
you
are
wizard
did
not
say
so
but
he
had
grey
tinted
sun
glasses
and
masonic
tie
pin
holmes
quite
simple
my
dear
watson
but
let
us
get
down
to
what
is
practical
must
admit
to
you
that
the
case
which
seemed
to
me
to
be
so
absurdly
simple
as
to
be
hardly
worth
my
notice
is
rapidly
assuming
very
different
aspect
it
is
true
that
though
in
your
mission
you
have
missed
everything
of
importance
yet
even
those
things
which
have
obtruded
themselves
upon
your
notice
give
rise
to
serious
thought
what
have
missed
don
be
hurt
my
dear
fellow
you
know
that
am
quite
impersonal
no
one
else
would
have
done
better
some
possibly
not
so
well
but
clearly
you
have
missed
some
vital
points
what
is
the
opinion
of
the
neighbours
about
this
man
amberley
and
his
wife
that
surely
is
of
importance
what
of
dr
ernest
was
he
the
gay
lothario
one
would
expect
with
your
natural
advantages
watson
every
lady
is
your
helper
and
accomplice
what
about
the
girl
at
the
post
office
or
the
wife
of
the
greengrocer
can
picture
you
whispering
soft
nothings
with
the
young
lady
at
the
blue
anchor
and
receiving
hard
somethings
in
exchange
all
this
you
have
left
undone
it
can
still
be
done
it
has
been
done
thanks
to
the
telephone
and
the
help
of
the
yard
can
usually
get
my
essentials
without
leaving
this
room
as
matter
of
fact
my
information
confirms
the
man
story
he
has
the
local
repute
of
being
miser
as
well
as
harsh
and
exacting
husband
that
he
had
large
sum
of
money
in
that
strong
room
of
his
is
certain
so
also
is
it
that
young
dr
ernest
an
unmarried
man
played
chess
with
amberley
and
probably
played
the
fool
with
his
wife
all
this
seems
plain
sailing
and
one
would
think
that
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
and
yet
and
yet

where
lies
the
difficulty
in
my
imagination
perhaps
well
leave
it
there
watson
let
us
escape
from
this
weary
workaday
world
by
the
side
door
of
music
carina
sings
to
night
at
the
albert
hall
and
we
still
have
time
to
dress
dine
and
enjoy
in
the
morning
was
up
betimes
but
some
toast
crumbs
and
two
empty
eggshells
told
me
that
my
companion
was
earlier
still
found
scribbled
note
upon
the
table
dear
watson
there
are
one
or
two
points
of
contact
which
should
wish
to
establish
with
mr
josiah
amberley
when
have
done
so
we
can
dismiss
the
case
or
not
would
only
ask
you
to
be
on
hand
about
three
clock
as
conceive
it
possible
that
may
want
you
saw
nothing
of
holmes
all
day
but
at
the
hour
named
he
returned
grave
preoccupied
and
aloof
at
such
times
it
was
wiser
to
leave
him
to
himself
has
amberley
been
here
yet
no
ah
am
expecting
him
he
was
not
disappointed
for
presently
the
old
fellow
arrived
with
very
worried
and
puzzled
expression
upon
his
austere
face
ve
had
telegram
mr
holmes
can
make
nothing
of
it
he
handed
it
over
and
holmes
read
it
aloud
come
at
once
without
fail
can
give
you
information
as
to
your
recent
loss
elman
the
vicarage
dispatched
at
10
from
little
purlington
said
holmes
little
purlington
is
in
essex
believe
not
far
from
frinton
well
of
course
you
will
start
at
once
this
is
evidently
from
responsible
person
the
vicar
of
the
place
where
is
my
crockford
yes
here
we
have
him
elman
living
of
moosmoor
cum
little
purlington
look
up
the
trains
watson
there
is
one
at
20
from
liverpool
street
excellent
you
had
best
go
with
him
watson
he
may
need
help
or
advice
clearly
we
have
come
to
crisis
in
this
affair
but
our
client
seemed
by
no
means
eager
to
start
it
perfectly
absurd
mr
holmes
he
said
what
can
this
man
possibly
know
of
what
has
occurred
it
is
waste
of
time
and
money
he
would
not
have
telegraphed
to
you
if
he
did
not
know
something
wire
at
once
that
you
are
coming
don
think
shall
go
holmes
assumed
his
sternest
aspect
it
would
make
the
worst
possible
impression
both
on
the
police
and
upon
myself
mr
amberley
if
when
so
obvious
clue
arose
you
should
refuse
to
follow
it
up
we
should
feel
that
you
were
not
really
in
earnest
in
this
investigation
our
client
seemed
horrified
at
the
suggestion
why
of
course
shall
go
if
you
look
at
it
in
that
way
said
he
on
the
face
of
it
seems
absurd
to
suppose
that
this
parson
knows
anything
but
if
you
think—
do
think
said
holmes
with
emphasis
and
so
we
were
launched
upon
our
journey
holmes
took
me
aside
before
we
left
the
room
and
gave
me
one
word
of
counsel
which
showed
that
he
considered
the
matter
to
be
of
importance
whatever
you
do
see
that
he
really
does
go
said
he
should
he
break
away
or
return
get
to
the
nearest
telephone
exchange
and
send
the
single
word
bolted
will
arrange
here
that
it
shall
reach
me
wherever
am
little
purlington
is
not
an
easy
place
to
reach
for
it
is
on
branch
line
my
remembrance
of
the
journey
is
not
pleasant
one
for
the
weather
was
hot
the
train
slow
and
my
companion
sullen
and
silent
hardly
talking
at
all
save
to
make
an
occasional
sardonic
remark
as
to
the
futility
of
our
proceedings
when
we
at
last
reached
the
little
station
it
was
two
mile
drive
before
we
came
to
the
vicarage
where
big
solemn
rather
pompous
clergyman
received
us
in
his
study
our
telegram
lay
before
him
well
gentlemen
he
asked
what
can
do
for
you
we
came
explained
in
answer
to
your
wire
my
wire
sent
no
wire
mean
the
wire
which
you
sent
to
mr
josiah
amberley
about
his
wife
and
his
money
if
this
is
joke
sir
it
is
very
questionable
one
said
the
vicar
angrily
have
never
heard
of
the
gentleman
you
name
and
have
not
sent
wire
to
anyone
our
client
and
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
perhaps
there
is
some
mistake
said
are
there
perhaps
two
vicarages
here
is
the
wire
itself
signed
elman
and
dated
from
the
vicarage
there
is
only
one
vicarage
sir
and
only
one
vicar
and
this
wire
is
scandalous
forgery
the
origin
of
which
shall
certainly
be
investigated
by
the
police
meanwhile
can
see
no
possible
object
in
prolonging
this
interview
so
mr
amberley
and
found
ourselves
on
the
roadside
in
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
most
primitive
village
in
england
we
made
for
the
telegraph
office
but
it
was
already
closed
there
was
telephone
however
at
the
little
railway
arms
and
by
it
got
into
touch
with
holmes
who
shared
in
our
amazement
at
the
result
of
our
journey
most
singular
said
the
distant
voice
most
remarkable
much
fear
my
dear
watson
that
there
is
no
return
train
to
night
have
unwittingly
condemned
you
to
the
horrors
of
country
inn
however
there
is
always
nature
watson
nature
and
josiah
amberley
you
can
be
in
close
commune
with
both
heard
his
dry
chuckle
as
he
turned
away
it
was
soon
apparent
to
me
that
my
companion
reputation
as
miser
was
not
undeserved
he
had
grumbled
at
the
expense
of
the
journey
had
insisted
upon
travelling
third
class
and
was
now
clamorous
in
his
objections
to
the
hotel
bill
next
morning
when
we
did
at
last
arrive
in
london
it
was
hard
to
say
which
of
us
was
in
the
worse
humour
you
had
best
take
baker
street
as
we
pass
said
mr
holmes
may
have
some
fresh
instructions
if
they
are
not
worth
more
than
the
last
ones
they
are
not
of
much
use
said
amberley
with
malevolent
scowl
none
the
less
he
kept
me
company
had
already
warned
holmes
by
telegram
of
the
hour
of
our
arrival
but
we
found
message
waiting
that
he
was
at
lewisham
and
would
expect
us
there
that
was
surprise
but
an
even
greater
one
was
to
find
that
he
was
not
alone
in
the
sitting
room
of
our
client
stern
looking
impassive
man
sat
beside
him
dark
man
with
grey
tinted
glasses
and
large
masonic
pin
projecting
from
his
tie
this
is
my
friend
mr
barker
said
holmes
he
has
been
interesting
himself
also
in
your
business
mr
josiah
amberley
though
we
have
been
working
independently
but
we
both
have
the
same
question
to
ask
you
mr
amberley
sat
down
heavily
he
sensed
impending
danger
read
it
in
his
straining
eyes
and
his
twitching
features
what
is
the
question
mr
holmes
only
this
what
did
you
do
with
the
bodies
the
man
sprang
to
his
feet
with
hoarse
scream
he
clawed
into
the
air
with
his
bony
hands
his
mouth
was
open
and
for
the
instant
he
looked
like
some
horrible
bird
of
prey
in
flash
we
got
glimpse
of
the
real
josiah
amberley
misshapen
demon
with
soul
as
distorted
as
his
body
as
he
fell
back
into
his
chair
he
clapped
his
hand
to
his
lips
as
if
to
stifle
cough
holmes
sprang
at
his
throat
like
tiger
and
twisted
his
face
towards
the
ground
white
pellet
fell
from
between
his
gasping
lips
no
short
cuts
josiah
amberley
things
must
be
done
decently
and
in
order
what
about
it
barker
have
cab
at
the
door
said
our
taciturn
companion
it
is
only
few
hundred
yards
to
the
station
we
will
go
together
you
can
stay
here
watson
shall
be
back
within
half
an
hour
the
old
colourman
had
the
strength
of
lion
in
that
great
trunk
of
his
but
he
was
helpless
in
the
hands
of
the
two
experienced
man
handlers
wriggling
and
twisting
he
was
dragged
to
the
waiting
cab
and
was
left
to
my
solitary
vigil
in
the
ill
omened
house

july
in
this
zone
corresponds
to
our
january
in
europe
but
the
sea
remained
smooth
and
easily
visible
ned
land
spent
eight
hours
out
of
every
twelve
reading
or
sleeping
in
his
cabin
hundred
times
chided
him
for
his
unconcern
“Bah
he
replied
“Nothing’s
out
there
professor
aronnax
can’t
you
see
we’re
just
wandering
around
at
random
people
say
they’ve
seen
this
slippery
beast
again
in
the
pacific
seas—I
want
to
believe
it
but
two
months
have
already
gone
by
since
then
so
if
the
beast
does
exist
it’s
already
long
gone
had
no
reply
to
this
obviously
we
were
just
groping
blindly
but
how
else
could
we
go
our
chances
were
pretty
limited
yet
everyone
still
felt
confident
of
success
we
were
finally
in
the
area
of
the
monster’s
latest
activity
the
entire
crew
suffered
from
nervous
excitement
that
it’s
beyond
me
to
describe
nobody
ate
nobody
slept
reaction
was
expected
to
follow
and
this
reaction
wasn’t
long
in
coming
for
three
months
during
which
each
day
seemed
like
century
the
abraham
lincoln
plowed
all
the
northerly
seas
of
the
pacific
and
we
found
nothing
at
first
discouragement
took
hold
of
people’s
minds
opening
the
door
to
disbelief
the
crew
called
themselves
“out
and
out
fools”
with
typical
human
fickleness
they
jumped
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
inevitably
the
most
enthusiastic
supporters
of
the
undertaking
became
its
most
energetic
opponents
and
this
futile
search
couldn’t
drag
on
much
longer
the
abraham
lincoln
had
done
everything
it
could
to
succeed
and
had
no
reason
to
blame
itself
the
crew
weren’t
responsible
for
this
failure
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
go
home
the
commander’s
sailors
couldn’t
hide
their
discontent
and
their
work
suffered
because
of
it
commander
farragut
asked
for
grace
period
17
grace
period
отсрочка
of
just
three
days
more
after
this
three
day
delay
if
the
monster
hadn’t
appeared
the
abraham
lincoln
would
chart
course
toward
the
european
seas
this
promise
was
given
on
november
it
had
the
immediate
effect
of
reviving
the
crew’s
failing
spirits
the
ocean
was
observed
with
renewed
care
spyglasses
functioned
with
feverish
energy
two
days
passed
the
ship
stayed
at
half
steam
thousand
methods
were
used
to
spark
the
animal’s
interest
or
rouse
it
from
its
apathy
at
noon
the
next
day
november
the
delay
expired
by
then
the
frigate
lay
in

than
200
miles
to

leeward

coming
on

o’clock

just
struck
huge
clouds
covered
the
moon’s
disk
just
then
was
leaning
over
the
starboard
rail
conseil
stared
straight
ahead
observing
conseil
discovered
that
just
barely
the
gallant
lad
had
fallen
under
the
general
influence
at
least
so
thought
perhaps
his
nerves
were
twitching
with
curiosity
for
the
first
time
in
history
“Come
on
conseil
told
him
“Here’s
your
last
chance
to
get
000
“If
master
will
permit
my
saying
so
conseil
replied
“I
never
expected
to
win
that
prize
and
the
union
government
could
have
promised
100
000
and
been
none
the
poorer
“You’re
right
conseil
it
turned
out
to
be
foolish
business
after
all
and
we
jumped
into
it
too
hastily
what
waste
of
time
six
months
ago
we
could
have
been
back
in
france—”
“In
master’s
little
apartment
conseil
answered
“In
master’s
museum
and
by
now
would
have
classified
master’s
fossils
“Quite
so
conseil
and
what’s
more
imagine
that
people
will
soon
be
laughing
at
us
conseil
didn’t
have
time
to
answer
voice
became
audible
it
was
ned
land’s
voice
and
it
shouted
“Ahoy
there’s
the
thing
abreast
of
us
to
leeward
chapter
at
this
shout
the
entire
crew
rushed
toward
the
harpooner—commander
officers
mates
sailors
cabin
boys
down
to
engineers
leaving
their
machinery
and
stokers
neglecting
their
furnaces
the
order
was
given
to
stop
ned
land
was
not
mistaken
and
we
all
saw
the
object
his
hand
was
indicating
not
far
from
the
abraham
lincoln
the
sea
was
lit
up
from
underneath
this
was
no
mere
phosphorescent
phenomenon
the
monster
gave
off
that
very
intense
but
inexplicable
glow
that
several
captains
had
mentioned
in
their
reports
this
magnificent
radiance
had
to
come
from
some
force
with
great
illuminating
capacity
universal
shout
went
up
from
the
frigate
“Quiet
commander
farragut
said
“Reverse

sailors
rushed
to
the
helm
engineers
to
their

“Right

commander
farragut
called
these
orders
were
executed
the
frigate
wanted
to
retreat
but
the
unearthly
animal
came
at
us
with
speed
double
our
own
we
gasped
more
stunned
than
afraid
we
stood
mute
and
motionless
the
animal
played
with
us
it
made
full
circle
around
the
frigate
and
wrapped
us
in
sheets
of
electricity
that
were
like
luminous
dust
then
it
retreated
two
or
three
miles
leaving
phosphorescent
trail
suddenly
the
monster
abruptly
dashed
toward
the
ship
with
frightening
speed
stopped
sharply
twenty
feet
from
us
and
died
out
then
it
reappeared
on
the
other
side
of
the
ship
meanwhile
was
astonished
at
the
frigate’s
maneuvers
it
was
not
fighting
built
to
pursue
it
was
being
pursued
and
commented
on
this
to
commander
farragut
his
face
ordinarily
so
emotionless
was
stamped
with
indescribable
astonishment
“Professor
aronnax
he
answered
me
“I
don’t
know
what
kind
of
fearsome
creature
see
and
don’t
want
my
frigate
running
foolish
risks
in
all
this
darkness
besides
how
should
we
attack
this
unknown
creature
how
should
we
defend
ourselves
against
it
let’s
wait
for
daylight
and
then
we’ll
play
different
role
“You’ve
no
further
doubts
commander
as
to
the
nature
of
this
animal
“No
sir
it’s
apparently
gigantic
narwhale
and
an
electric
one
it’s
surely
the
most
dreadful
animal
ever
conceived
by
our
creator
the
whole
crew
stayed
on
their
feet
all
night
long
no
one
even
thought
of
sleeping
unable
to
compete
with
the
monster’s
speed
the
abraham
lincoln
slowed
down
the
narwhale
mimicked
the
frigate
simply
rode
with
the
waves
however
near
midnight
it
disappeared
or
to
use
more
appropriate
expression
“it
went
out
like
huge
glowworm
had
it
fled
from
us
at
12
53
in
the
morning
deafening
hiss
became
audible
resembling
the
sound
made
by
waterspout
expelled
with
tremendous
intensity
“Ned
land
the
commander
asked
“you’ve
often
heard
whales
bellowing
“Often
sir
but
never
whale
like
this
whose
sighting
earned
me
000
“Correct
the
prize
is
rightfully
yours
but
tell
me
isn’t
that
the
noise
cetaceans
make
when
they
spurt
water
from
their
blowholes
“The
very
noise
sir
but
this
one’s
way
louder
so
there
can
be
no
mistake
there’s
definitely
whale
lurking
in
our
waters
with
your
permission
sir
the
harpooner
added
“tomorrow
at
daybreak
we’ll
have
words
with
it
“If
it’s
in
mood
to
listen
to
you
mr
land
replied
in
tone
far
from
convinced
near
two
o’clock
in
the
morning
the
core
of
light
reappeared
no
less
intense
five
miles
to
windward
of
the
abraham
lincoln
despite
the
distance
despite
the
noise
of
wind
and
sea
we
could
distinctly
hear
the
animal’s
panting
breath
seemingly
the
moment
this
enormous
narwhale
came
up
to
breathe
at
the
surface
of
the
ocean
air
was
sucked
into
its
lungs
like
steam
into
the
huge
cylinders
“Hmm
said
to
myself
“Now
that’s
whale
of
whale
we
stayed
on
the
alert
until
daylight
getting
ready
for
action
our
chief
officer
loaded
the
blunderbusses
ned
land
sharpened
his
harpoon
dreadful
weapon
in
his
hands
at
six
o’clock
day
began
to
break
and
with
the
dawn’s
early
light
the
narwhale’s
electric
glow
disappeared
at
seven
o’clock
very
dense
morning
mist
shrank
the
horizon
and
our
best
spyglasses
were
unable
to
pierce
it
the
outcome
disappointment
and
anger
at
eight
o’clock
the
horizon
grew
wider
and
clearer
all
at
once
suddenly
just
as
on
the
previous
evening
ned
land’s
voice
was
audible
“There’s
the
thing
astern
to
port
the
harpooner
shouted
every
eye
looked
toward
the
point
indicated
there
mile
and
half
from
the
frigate
long
blackish
body
emerged
meter
above
the
waves
its
tail
was
creating
considerable
eddy
our
frigate
drew
nearer
to
the
cetacean
put
its
length
at
only
250
feet
its
girth
was
more
difficult
to
judge
but
the
animal
seemed
to
be
wonderfully
proportioned
in
all
three
dimensions
while
was
observing
this
phenomenal
creature
two
jets
of
steam
and
water
sprang
from
its
blowholes
and
rose
to
an
altitude
of
forty
meters
the
crew
were
waiting
impatiently
for
orders
from
their
leader
the
latter
after
carefully
observing
the
animal
called
for
his
engineer
“Clap
on
full
steam

the
commander
said
“Aye
sir
the
engineer
replied
three
cheers
greeted
this
order
the
hour
of
battle
had
sounded
few
moments
later
the
frigate’s
two
funnels
vomited
torrents
of
black
smoke
driven
forward
by
its
powerful
propeller
the
abraham
lincoln
headed
straight
for
the
animal
unconcerned
the
latter
let
us
come
within
half
cable
length
then
it
got
up
little
speed
retreated
and
kept
its
distance
this
chase
dragged
on
for
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
but
it
was
useless
at
this
rate
it
was
obvious
that
we
would
never
catch
up
with
it
“Ned
land
commander
farragut
called
the
canadian
reported
at
once
“Well
mr
land
the
commander
asked
“do
you
still
advise
putting
my
longboats
to
sea
“No
sir
ned
land
replied
“because
that
beast
won’t
be
caught
against
its
will
“Then
what
should
we
do
“If
we
can
get
within
harpoon
length
i’ll
harpoon
the
brute
“Go
to
it
ned
commander
farragut
replied
ned
land
made
his
way
to
his
post
we
verified
that
our
ship
was
going
at
the
rate
of
18
5 miles
per
hour
but
that
damned
animal
also
did
speed
of
18
this
was
humiliating
for
one
of
the
fastest
ships
in
the
american
navy
what
chase
no
can’t
describe
the
excitement
that
shook
my
very
being

stayed
at

several
times
the

approach
but
by
noon
we
were
no
farther
along
than
at
eight
o’clock
in
the
morning
commander
farragut
then
decided
to
use
more
direct
methods
“Bah
he
said
“So
that
animal
is
faster
than
us
all
right
we’ll
see
if
it
can
outrun

fired

passed
some
feet
above

mile
off

to
the

that
infernal
beast
the
commander
shouted
an
old
gray
bearded
gunner
approached
the
cannon
put
it
in
position
and
took
aim
there
was
mighty
explosion
mingled
with
cheers
from
the
crew
the
shell
reached
its
target
it
hit
the
animal
but
not
in
the
usual
fashion—it
bounced
off
that
rounded
surface
and
vanished
into
the
sea
two
miles
out
“Oh
said
the
old
gunner
in
his
anger
“That
rascal
must
be
covered
with
six
inch
armor

“Curse
the
beast
commander
farragut
shouted
the
hunt
was
on
again
and
commander
farragut
leaned
over
to
me
saying
“I’ll
chase
that
animal
till
my
frigate
explodes
“Yes
replied
“and
nobody
would
blame
you
we
could
still
hope
that
the
animal
would
tire
out
but
no
such
luck
hour
after
hour
went
by
without
it
showing
the
least
sign
of
weariness
night
fell
and
wrapped
the
surging
ocean
in
its
shadows
by
then
thought
our
expedition
had
come
to
an
end
that
we
would
never
see
this
fantastic
animal
again
was
mistaken
at
10
50
in
the
evening
that
electric
light
reappeared
just
as
clear
and
intense
as
the
night
before
the
narwhale
seemed
motionless
was
it
asleep
perhaps
weary
from
its
workday
just
riding
with
the
waves
this
was
our
chance
and
commander
farragut
was
determined
to
take
full
advantage
of
it
he
gave
his
orders
ned
land
went
to
resume
his
post
the
frigate
approached
without
making
sound
stopped
two
cable
lengths
from
the
animal
not
soul
breathed
on
board
profound
silence
reigned
over
the
deck
just
then
saw
ned
land
below
me
one
hand
grasping
the
martingale
the
other
brandishing
his
dreadful
harpoon
barely
twenty
feet
separated
him
from
the
motionless
animal
all
at
once
his
arm
shot
forward
and
the
harpoon
was
launched
heard
the
weapon
collide
resonantly
as
if
it
had
hit
some
hard
substance
the
electric
light
suddenly
went
out
and
two
enormous
waterspouts
crashed
onto
the
deck
of
the
frigate
racing
like
torrent
toppling
crewmen
breaking
masts
hideous
collision
occurred
and
thrown
over
the
rail
was
hurled
into
the

chapter
although
was
startled
by
this
unexpected
descent
have
very
clear
recollection
of
my
sensations
during
it
at
first
was
dragged
about
twenty
feet
under

on
the
way
down
with
two
vigorous
kicks
came
back
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
my
first
concern
was
to
look
for
the
frigate
had
the
crew
seen
me
would
commander
farragut
put
longboat
to
sea
could
hope
to
be
rescued
the
gloom
was
profound
saw
black
mass
disappearing
eastward
where
its
running
lights
were
fading
out
in
the
distance
it
was
the
frigate
“Help
help
shouted
swimming
desperately
toward
the
abraham
lincoln
my
clothes
were
weighing
me
down
the
water
glued
them
to
my
body
it
was
paralyzing
my
movements
was
sinking
was
suffocating
“Help
this
was
the
last
shout
gave
my
mouth
was
filling
with
water
suddenly
my
clothes
were
seized
by
energetic
hands
somebody
pulled
me
abruptly
back
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
yes
heard
these
words
pronounced
in
my
ear
“If
master
would
oblige
me
by
leaning
on
my
shoulder
master
will
swim
with
much
greater
ease
with
one
hand
seized
the
arm
of
my
loyal
conseil
“You

“You
“Myself

replied
“and
at

command
“That
collision
threw
you
overboard
along
with
me
“Not
at
all
but
followed
master
the
fine
lad
“What
about
the
frigate
asked
“The
frigate
conseil
replied
rolling
over
on
his
back
“Just
as
jumped
overboard
heard
the
men
at
the
helm
shout
‘Our
propeller
and
rudder
are
smashed
’”
“Smashed
“Yes
smashed
by
the
monster’s
tusk
believe
it’s
the
sole
injury
the
abraham
lincoln
has
sustained
but
most
inconveniently
for
us
the
ship
can
no
longer
steer
however
we
still
have
few
hours
before
us
and
in
few
hours
one
can
do
great
many
things
conseil’s
composure
cheered
me
up
swam
more
vigorously
our
circumstances
were
dreadful
perhaps
they
hadn’t
seen
us
go
overboard
and
even
if
they
had
the
frigate
couldn’t
return
to
leeward
after
us
so
we
could
count
only
on
its
longboats
decided
to
divide
our
energies
so
we
wouldn’t
both
be
worn
out
at
the
same
time
while
one
of
us
lay
on
his
back
staying
motionless
with
arms
crossed
and
legs
outstretched
the
other
would
swim
and
propel
his
partner
forward

on
eight
hours
of
swimming
until

task

to
our
relieving
each

the
sea
was
pretty
smooth
and
barely
tired
us
near
one
o’clock
in
the
morning
was
overcome
with
tremendous
exhaustion
and
soon
heard
the
poor
conseil
gasping
his
breathing
became
shallow
and
quick
didn’t
think
he
could
stand
such
exertions
for
much
longer
“Go
on

on
told
him
“Leave

behind
he
replied
“Never
the
moon
appeared
the
surface
of
the
sea
glistened
under
its
rays
held
up
my
head
saw
the
frigate
it
was
five
miles
from
us
and
formed
dark
barely
perceptible
mass
but
as
for
longboats
not
one
in
sight
tried
to
call
out
what
was
the
use
at
such
distance
my
swollen
lips
wouldn’t
let
single
sound
through
conseil
could
still
articulate
few
words
and
heard
him
repeat
at
intervals
“Help
help
we
listened
and
it
may
have
been
ringing
in
my
ear
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
conseil’s
shout
had
received
an
answer
back
“Did
you
hear
that
muttered
“Yes
yes
and
conseil
hurled
another
desperate
plea
into
space
this
time
there
could
be
no
mistake
human
voice
had
answered
us
was
it
the
voice
of
some
other
victim
of
that
collision
suffered
by
our
ship
or
was
it
one
of
the
frigate’s
longboats
hailing
us
out
of
the
gloom
conseil
made
one
final
effort
he
raised
himself
half
out
of
the
water
then
fell
back
exhausted
“What
did
you
see
“I
saw
he
muttered
“I
saw
but
we
mustn’t
talk
save
our
strength
what
had
he
seen
conseil
kept
towing
me
sometimes
he
looked
up
stared
straight
ahead
and
shouted
request
for
directions
which
was
answered
by
voice
that
was
getting
closer
and
closer
could
barely
hear
it
was
at
the
end
of
my
strength
my
fingers
gave
out
my
hands
were
no
help
to
me
my
mouth
opened
convulsively
filling
with
brine
raised
my
head
one
last
time
then
fainted
someone
was
massaging
me
vigorously
half
opened
my
eyes
“Conseil
muttered
just
then
in
the
last
light
of
moon
saw
face
that
wasn’t
conseil’s
but
which
recognized
at
once
“Ned
exclaimed
“In
person
sir
and
still
after
his
prize
the
canadian
replied
“You
were
thrown
overboard
after
the
frigate’s
collision
“Yes
professor
but
was
luckier
than
you
and
right
away
was
able
to
set
foot
on
this
floating
islet
“Islet
“Or
in
other
words
on
our
gigantic
narwhale
“Explain
yourself

“It’s
just
that
soon
realized
why
my
harpoon
couldn’t
puncture
its
hide
“Why

why
“Because
professor
this
beast
is
made
of
steel
the
canadian’s
last
words
caused
sudden
upheaval
in
my
brain
swiftly
hoisted
myself
to
the
summit
of
this
half
submerged
creature
or
object
that
was
serving
as
our
refuge
tested
it
with
my
foot
obviously
it
was
some
hard
impenetrable
substance

the
soft
matter
that
makes
up
the
bodies
of
our
big
marine
mammals
the
blackish
back
supporting
me
was
smooth
and
polished

it
was
made

no
doubts
were
possible
this
animal
this
monster
this
natural
phenomenon
that
had
puzzled
the
whole
scientific
world
was
an
even
more
astonishing
phenomenon—a
phenomenon
made
by
the

man
even
if
had
discovered
that
some
fabulous
mythological
creature
really
existed
it
wouldn’t
have
given
me
such
terrific
mental
jolt
there
was
no
question
now
we
were
lying
on
the
back
of
some
kind
of
underwater
boat
that
boasted
the
shape
of
an
immense
steel
fish
“But
then
said
“does
this
contraption
contain
some
sort
of
locomotive
mechanism
and
crew
to
run
it
“Apparently
the
harpooner
replied
“And
yet
for
the
three
hours
i’ve
lived
on
this
floating
island
it
hasn’t
shown
sign
of
life
“This
boat
hasn’t
moved
at
all
“No
professor
aronnax
it
just
rides
with
the
waves
“But
we
know
that
it’s
certainly
gifted
with
great
speed
now
then
since
an
engine
is
needed
to
generate
that
speed
and
mechanic
to
run
that
engine
conclude
we’re
saved
“Humph
ned
land
muttered
“As
long
as
it
swims
i’ve
no
complaints
but
if
it
dives
wouldn’t
give
00
for
my
life
so
it
was
imperative
to
make
contact
with
someone
inside
the
plating
of
this
machine
searched
its
surface
for
an
opening
or
hatch
but
the
lines
of
rivets
were
straight
and
uniform
moreover
the
moon
then
disappeared
and
left
us
in
profound
darkness
we
had
to
wait
for
daylight
to
find
some
way
of
getting
inside
this
underwater
boat
near
four
o’clock
in
the
morning
the
submersible
picked
up
speed
we
could
barely
cope
with
this
dizzying
rush
finally
the
long
night
was
over
thought
heard
indistinct
sounds
sort
of
elusive
harmony
produced
by
distant
musical
chords
what
beings
lived
inside
this
strange
boat
what
mechanical
force
allowed
it
to
move
about
with
such
prodigious
speed
daylight
appeared
the
morning
mists
surrounded
us
was
about
to
proceed
with
careful
examination
of
the
hull
when
felt
it
sinking
little
by
little
“Oh
damnation
ned
land
shouted
stamping
his
foot
on
the
resonant
sheet
iron
“Open
up
there
you
navigators
fortunately
this
submerging
movement
stopped
from
inside
the
boat
there
suddenly
came
noises
of
iron
fastenings
one
of
the
steel
plates
flew
up
man
appeared
gave
bizarre
yell
and
instantly
disappeared
few
moments
later
eight
fellows
appeared
silently
their
faces
like
masks
and
dragged
us
down
into
their
fearsome
machine
chapter
this
capture
was
carried
out
with
lightning
speed
my
companions
and
had
no
time
to
collect
ourselves
don’t
know
how
they
felt
but
as
for
me
was
shivering
all
over
with
whom
were
we
dealing
surely
with
some
pirates
the
narrow
hatch
had
barely
closed
over
me
when
was
surrounded
by
profound
darkness
felt
my
naked
feet
clinging
to
the
steps
of
an
iron
ladder
ned
land
and
conseil
were
behind
me
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
door
opened
and
instantly
closed
behind
us
we
were
alone
where
couldn’t
say
couldn’t
even
imagine
all
was
darkness
“Damnation
ned
land
exclaimed
“These
people
are
not
very
hospitable
wouldn’t
be
surprised
if
they
were
cannibals
“Calm
yourself

my
friend
conseil
replied
serenely
“We
aren’t
in

yet
“In

no
the
canadian
shot
back
“but
in
an
oven
for
sure
luckily
my
knife
hasn’t
left
me
and
can
still
see
well
enough
to
use
it
the
first
one
of
these
bandits

lays

“Don’t

then
told
the
harpooner
“and
don’t
ruin

who
knows
whether
they
might
be

to
us
instead
let’s
try
to
find
out
where
we
are
half
an
hour
had
already
gone
by
without
our
situation
changing
when
our
eyes
saw
blinding
light
our
prison
lit
up
all
at
once
recognized
the
electric
glow
“Finally
it’s
light
enough
to
see

exclaimed
knife
in

“Yes
replied
“But
as
for
our
situation
we’re
still
in
the
dark
“Master
must
learn
patience
said
the
emotionless
conseil
this
sudden
illumination
of
our
cabin
enabled
me
to
examine
its
details
it
contained
only
table
and
five
stools
its
invisible
door
must
have
been
hermetically
sealed
not
sound
reached
our
ears
everything
seemed
dead
inside
this
boat
was
it
in
motion
or
stationary
on
the
surface
of
the
ocean
or
sinking
into
the
depths
couldn’t
tell
door
opened
and
two
men
appeared
one
was
short
and
stocky
powerfully
muscled
broad
shouldered
robust
of
limbs
the
hair
black
and
luxuriant
the
mustache
heavy
the
eyes
bright
and
penetrating
the
second
stranger
was
man
of
great
pride
his
calm
firm
gaze
seemed
to
reflect
thinking
on
an
elevated
plane
whether
this
individual
was
thirty
five
or
fifty
years
of
age
could
not
precisely
state
he
was
tall
his
forehead
broad
his
nose
straight
his
mouth
clearly
etched
his
teeth
magnificent
his
hands
refined
one
unusual
detail
his
eyes
were
spaced
little
far
from
each
other
and
could
instantly
take
in
nearly
quarter
of
the
horizon
wearing
caps
made
of
sea
otter
fur
and
shod
in
sealskin
fishing
boots
these
two
strangers
were
dressed
in
clothing
made
from
some
unique
fabric
that
allowed
great
freedom
of
movement
the
taller
of
the
two—apparently
the
leader
on
board—examined
us
with
the
greatest
care
but
without
pronouncing
word
then
turning
to
his
companion
he
conversed
with
him
in
language
didn’t
recognize
it
was
sonorous
harmonious
flexible
dialect
the
other
replied
with
shake
of
the
head
and
added
two
or
three
incomprehensible
words
then
he
looked
at
me
replied
in
clear
french
that
wasn’t
familiar
with
his
language
but
he
didn’t
seem
to
understand
me
“Still
master
should
tell
our
story
conseil
said
to
me
“Perhaps
these
gentlemen
will
grasp
few
words
of
it
tried
again
telling
the
tale
of
our
adventures
clearly
articulating
my
every
syllable
and
not
leaving
out
single
detail
stated
our
names
and
titles
then
in
order
introduced
myself
professor
aronnax
my
servant
conseil
and
mr
ned
land
harpooner
the
man
with
calm
gentle
eyes
listened
to
me
serenely
even
courteously
and
paid
remarkable
attention
but
nothing
indicated
that
he
understood
my
story
when
finished
he
didn’t
pronounce
single
word
one
resource
still
left
was
to
speak
english
perhaps
they
would
be
familiar
with
this
nearly
universal
language
“Come
on
it’s
your
turn
told
the
harpooner
“Mr
land
try
for
more
favorable
result
than
mine
ned
started
our
story
all
over
again
its
content
was
the
same
but
the
form
differed
carried
away
by
his
volatile
temperament
the
canadian
complained
vehemently
about
being
imprisoned
in
defiance
of
his
civil
rights
and
he
added
that
we
were
dying
of
hunger
this
was
perfectly
true
but
we
had
nearly
forgotten
the
fact
our
visitors
didn’t
not
say
word
no
longer
knew
what
tactic
to
pursue
when
conseil
told
me
“If
master
will
authorize
me
i’ll
tell
the
whole
business
in
german
“What
you
know
german
exclaimed
“Like
most
flemish
people
with
all
due
respect
to
master
and
conseil
in
his
serene
voice
described
for
the
third
time
our
story
but
despite
our
narrator’s
fine
accent
the
german
language
met
with
no
success
finally
as
last
resort
tried
to
narrate
our
adventures
in
latin
with
the
same
negative
result
the
two
strangers
exchanged
few
words
in
their
incomprehensible
language
and
withdrew
the
door
closed
again
“This
is
outrageous
ned
land
shouted
“We
speak
french
english
german
and
latin
to
theserogues
and
neither
of
them
has
the
decency
to
even
answer
back
“Calm
down
ned
told
the
seething
harpooner
“Anger
won’t
get
us
anywhere
we
mustn’t
despair
let
us
wait
bit
before
we
form
our
views
on
the
commander
and
crew
of
this
boat
“My
views
are
fully
formed
ned

shot
back
“They’re
rogues
“Oh
good
and
from
what
country
“Roguedom
“My
gallant
ned
that
country
isn’t
clearly
marked
on
maps
of
the
world
what
is
the
nationality
of
these
two
strangers
neither
english
french
nor
german
that’s
all
we
can
say
but
there
must
be
southern
blood
in
them
probably
they’re
spaniards
turks
arabs
or
east
indians
and
as
for
their
speech
it’s
incomprehensible
the
door
opened
steward
entered
he
brought
us
some
clothes
jackets
and
sailor’s
pants
made
out
of
fabric
whose
nature
didn’t
recognize
we
hurried
to
change
into
them
meanwhile
our
silent
steward
perhaps
deaf
mute
set
the
table
and
laid
three
place
settings
overlaid
with
silver
dish
covers
various
platters
had
been
neatly
positioned
on
the
table
cloth
and
we
sat
down
to
eat
assuredly
we
were
dealing
with
civilized
people
the
water
was
fresh
and
clear
among
the
foods
we
were
served

able
to
identify
various
fish

for
the

it
was
elegant

in
perfect

its

moving
within
the
moving

it
was
highly
appropriate
motto
for
this
underwater
machine
the
letter
was
no
doubt
the
initial
of
the
name
of
that
mystifying
individual
in
command
beneath
the
seas
our
appetites
appeased
we
felt
an
urgent
need
for
sleep
natural
reaction
after
that
interminable
night
of
fighting
for
our
lives
my
two
companions
lay
down
on
the
cabin’s
carpeting
and
were
soon
deep
in
slumber
as
for
me
too
many
thoughts
had
piled
up
in
my
mind
too
many
insoluble
questions
had
arisen
too
many
images
were
keeping
my
eyelids
open
where
were
we
what
strange
power
was
carrying
us
along
then
my
mind
grew
calmer
my
imagination
melted
into
hazy
drowsiness
and
soon
fell
into
an
uneasy
slumber
chapter
had
gotten
up
from
my
passably
hard
mattress
when
felt
my
mind
clear
so
began
careful
reexamination
of
our
cell
nothing
had
changed
in
its
interior
arrangements
the
prison
was
still
prison
and
its
prisoners
still
prisoners
but
the
steward
had
cleared
the
table
consequently
nothing
indicated
any
forthcoming
improvement
in
our
situation
and
seriously
wondered
if
we
were
doomed
to
spend
the
rest
of
our
lives
in
this
cage
it
was
becoming
hard
for
me
to
breathe
the
heavy
air
was
no
longer
sufficient
for
my
lungs
although
our
cell
was
large
we
obviously
had
used
up
most
of
the
oxygen
it
contained
so
it
was
now
urgent
to
renew
the
air
in
our
prison
and
no
doubt
the
air
in
this
whole
underwater
boat
as
well
how
did
the
commander
of
this
aquatic
residence
get
fresh
air
did
he
obtain
air
using
chemical
methods
releasing
the
oxygen
contained
in
potassium
chlorate
by
heating
it
if
so
he
would
have
to
keep
up
some
kind
of
relationship
with
the
shore
suddenly
was
refreshed
by
current
of
clean
air
scented
with
salty
aroma
it
had
to
be
sea
breeze
life
giving
and
charged
with
iodine
opened
my
mouth
wide
this
boat
this
sheet
iron
monster
had
obviously
just
risen
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
so
the
ship’s
mode
of
ventilation
was
finally
established
ned
and
conseil
woke
up
almost
simultaneously
under
the
influence
of
this
reviving
air
purification
they
rubbed
their
eyes
stretched
their
arms
and
sprang
to
their
feet
“Did
master
sleep
well
conseil
asked
me
“Extremely
well
my
gallant
lad
replied
“And
how
about
you
mr
ned
land
“Like
log
professor
but
it
seems
like
i’m
breathing

seaman
couldn’t
be
wrong
on
this
topic
and
told
the
canadian
what
had
gone
on
while
he
slept
“Good
he
said
“That
explains
perfectly
everything
but
i’ve
no
idea
what
time
it
is
professor
aronnax
maybe
it’s
dinnertime
“Dinnertime
my
fine
harpooner
i’d
say
at
least
breakfast
time
because
we’ve
certainly
woken
up
to
new
day
“Which
indicates
conseil
replied
“that
we’ve
spent
twenty
four
hours
in
slumber
“That’s
my
assessment
replied
“I
won’t
argue
with
you
ned
land
answered
“But
dinner
or
breakfast
that
steward
will
be
plenty
welcome
whether
he
brings
the
one
or
the
other
“The
one
and
the
other
conseil
said
“Well
the
canadian
replied
“We
deserve
two
meals
“All
right
ned
let’s
wait
and
see
replied
“It’s
clear
that
these
strangers
don’t
intend
to
let
us
die
of
hunger
“Unless
they’re
fattening
us
up

shot
back
“I
object
replied
“We
have
not
fallen
into
the
hands
of
cannibals
“Who
knows
the
canadian
replied
in
all
seriousness
“Maybe
these
people
have
gone
without
fresh
meat
for
long
while
and
in
that
case
three
healthy
well
built
specimens
like
the
professor
his
servant
and
me—”
“Get
rid
of
those
ideas
mr
land
answered
the
harpooner
“Anyhow
the
harpooner
said
“I’m
hungry
“Mr
land
answered
“we
have
to
adapt
to
the
schedule
on
board
and
imagine
our
stomachs
are
running
ahead
of
the
chief
cook’s
dinner
bell
“Well
then
we’ll
adjust
our
stomachs

replied
serenely
“Conseil

impatient

back
“You’re
so
calm

rather
than
complain
“Let’s

“Let’s
be
guided
by
events
and
let’s
do
nothing
since
right
now
there’s
nothing
we
can

“On
the
contrary

the

replied
“There

“Oh

“Breaking
out
of

is
difficult
enough
but
with

it
is
completely
impossible
the
harpooner
said
nothing
under
the
conditions
in
which
fate
had
left
us
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
escape
“So
professor
aronnax
ned

went
on
after
thinking
for
few
moments
“you
haven’t
figured
out

added
“What’s

asked
“You’d

“Very

“It’s

some
promising
opportunity
might
come
up

our

finished

withdrew
into

no

was
getting
him
madder

madder
he
stood
up
pacing
in
circles
like
wild
beast
in

striking
the
walls
with
his
foot
and

meanwhile
the
hours
passed

unmercifully

the

were
deaf
didn’t

the

undoubtedly
sunk
into

watery
deep

no

noise
was
audible
outside

turned

the

already
trying

it
was
the
ship’s
commander
who
had
just
spoken
at
these
words
ned
land
stood
up
quickly
in
silence
we
waited
for
the
outcome

this
scene
conseil
seemed
almost
fascinated
was
stunned
arms
crossed
leaning
against
corner

the

studied
us
with
great
care
did
he
regret
those
words
he
had
just
pronounced
in

you
would
have

“Gentlemen

in
calm
penetrating
voice
“I
